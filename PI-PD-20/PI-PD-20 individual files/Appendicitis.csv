Appendicitis,Pain and tenderness coming back after appendectomy ,"HI, I had my appendix out via keyhole surgery about 2 1/2 weeks ago. My appendix hadn't ruptured but it was chronically inflamed as I apparently had appendicitis in September but was wrongly diagnosed in hospital.Everything seemed to be healing ok and the pain was easing, but exactly 2 weeks after the op I noticed the site where my original pain was had become very sore and tender again, and I then also got what felt like muscle pain under my ribs. I saw my GP and got signed off work for a couple more days, and he sent me for urgent bloods. My bloods all came back fine but he told me to go to A&E if I was still in pain on the Saturday (yesterday) as he thought the pain should have gone by this time. The pain eased again and was fine until yesterday afternoon, after I had taken a train journey and walked more than I have for a while. Now I am very sore again. Is it possible I have just done a bit too much and strained myself? I don't want to go to A&E as the pain isn't bad enough to feel like an emergency but I really don't know what's happening. Does this sound normal? I'm really anxious and frustrated as I've been in pain since September and I thought everything would have resolved by now!"
Appendicitis,I’ve had an appendectomy and told that my appendix looked fibrous. What does that mean?,"Hi,I posted on here a few months back about my attempt to get some treatment, following months of pain from when my appendix perforated and formed an abcess, an appendix mass. I had an exploratory laproscopy a few days ago, where they found a virtually intact appendix, told me it didnt look infected, but was fibrous. they have sent it to pathology. just wondering what could this mean?Ive had the pain of appendicitis at varying levels, before and ever since it ""perforated"". I have visited a and e 6 times when my symptons have been acute and been admitted once for a bowel blockage , in my opinion as a result of the appendix affecting it since the appendix mass. I have had 3 contrast CT scans, 1 MRI , 2 xrays, 2 ultrasounds, since the perforated appendix. All have come back with results stating there is no appendix left. How can that happen?The lower gi surgical team are not keen to share too many details. having been hassling them to do something to help me for 9months , I am not their favourite patient, so I cant see them passing on much info from pathology."
Appendicitis,Appendix?,"hello i am a 28 year old female who the last few days have had loss of appetite out of no where, bloating and nausea. today i have a sharp pain that comes and goes around the area of my right ovary. Its not horrible maybe a 4.5 on a scale from 1-10. i did just finish a period about 5 days ago but starting to feel worse and worse. could this be appendix? i do not have insurance so the only option is ER so trying to avoid a huge bill if its not needed. i just worried because of the location of the pain. TIA"
Appendicitis,Feels like appendix is “grumbling” 3 months after appendix mass. What are NHS protocols?,"Hi, I got diagnosed for appendix mass, when they operated to perform what was thought to be a simple appendectomy. The hospital kept telling me that my symptons , age and reaction to pain indicated that ""it must be something else"" causing pain, its only mild appencitis. i then waited 2 days for surgery. To cut a long story short, the abcess they found was ""colossal"" and sat on top of my bowel. they could not risk removing the mass as they could have perforated my bowel.I was treated with IV antibiotics for 10 days , followed by oral antibiotics for 2 weeks. I then had a CT scan to check the area and a conoloscopy to check the bowel. both came back normal. I have my consultation with the surgeon in a few days time and really dont want to be fobbed off again. I am in considerable pain after 3 months recovery and feel as if i have low grade appencitis . what are the gold standard NHS norms for dealing with appendix mass? Some info on line points to another op to remove whats left behind, others claim its dealt with using antibiotics. What rights do I have in terms of involvement in the treatment plan?What can I push for?"

Appendicitis,Appendicitis???,"Help, please. I had a full hysterectomy July 3. I was fine for about a week after then I started feeling really bloated and painful around the insicion that was just above my belly button. I have been chewing gas x cause I thought it was bloating from the hysterectomy. But now the pain has moved to my lower right hand side of my pelvis. It has left me feeling like I need the poop.

Appendicitis,Ongoing problems after Appendix removal ,"Good morning/evening! I'm hoping someone can help me or advise further, I had my appendix removed, via keyhole surgery on the 16th July. The pain was horrible! I even nearly passed out which has never happened before, no pain relief was touching the pain, even down to IV morphine. However they did mention possible ovarian cysts. Also in my urine sample it came back with ""blood present!"" After having the surgery I was admitted back in on the 22nd July for Five days as the incision in my belly button was infected (however this didn't show up on my bloods) I was treated for pain, and given antibiotics. I was in this time checked for fluid, gas still remaining and I was given a Ultrasound, X-ray and CT which I was told all were perfectly clear (please keep that in mind) I have recently got back to hospital because I am still in agony! I have pain in my right side where my appendix was, radiating upwards, also pain between my belly button incision and the left incision like a knife is cutting my up on the insides, it's awful! However they only now feel like telling me cysts were present on my ovaries, and my results from my appendix came back and I didn't have any infection or inflammation! I am stuck for words! I had another ultrasound and X-ray and apparently no cysts again? I'm in agony! I have another appointment with the hospital this Thursday and I am just confused as hell! Has anyone got issues after having the appendix removed? Or any possible other diagnosis? I will be asking them to check everything again (as mentioned I've had CT ultrasound X-ray bloods and urine checked) and it's ridiculous how this is draining me down and getting to me. I constantly feel sick, food isn't appealing to me however I eat because my mother will still force feed me to this day, the pain is enough to wake me up at night or I struggle to sleep as I sleep on my side and this is a struggle to do because of the pain. Please note through this whole time I have also had diarrhoea so they have booked me a flexible endoscopy If anyone has any suggestion? Possible help? I'm currently going to go into hospital on Thursday and I've kept a diary for pain, a book of questions and notes however any help is greatly received!"
Appendicitis,Help me out please,"So past week over I've had stomach pains upper and lower that was really painful bottom right, it went off abit on the bottom right until it randomly came on like a sharp pain asif I got stabbed I got rushed to hospital which showed a appendix mass,I've been on antibiotics for 3 days and got released from hospital today but I keep getting like a sharp twingle in that place that happens every couple of minutes is this normal or is it a sign of it not getting better? Also I have to have keyhole to remove it soon but maybe open depending on surgeon but they said most likely keyhole. What is it like having them put tubes down your throat ect and what is it like being put to sleep and waking up? (I'm 20) and have never had anything done before and I'm really scared about it. Thanks for any replies"
Appendicitis,Worried I might have appendicitis,"Okay, so for the past few weeks I have been having some mild pain underneath both of my breasts, on the ribs. It wasn't really bothersome. And recently, I just started getting some mild pain in my lower back, like near my butt & tailbone. Was feeling some pain on both of my sides, mostly on the left. Now, I'm just feeling it in my right side. There is a little bit of pain and some discomfort. I had quite a few people press down on where it hurts and it doesn't hurt any worse when they removed their hand. I had a blood and urine test done at the emergency room a couple of days ago and that was all normal. No CT scan. I'm very worried and am not sure what is going on. Could someone please help me out here? I am so scared there may be something seriously wrong. ? Oh, and I should also mention that the pain comes and goes, been occurring in random areas around my right abdomen, some in the front but not much, and around the ribs.

Appendicitis,Pain 2 weeks after Appendectomy.,"I'm a 19 year old female. So about 2 weeks ago, I had key hole surgery to remove my appendix. There was nothing wrong with my appendix but the doctors had no idea what was causing my pain so they took it out anyway, after finding there were no other problems causing my symptoms. I had a urine infection at the same time but it wasn't causing my sharp lower abdomen pain. Now after surgery, I'm starting to get a few of my old symptoms back, but its not constant. Its things like back pain, stomach aches, tiredness, stabbing pain just above my right hip and headaches all the time!! The pain is no where near as bad as it was before surgery but my painkillers aren't working and I'm in pain and uncomfortable. what should I do?I'm a 19 year old female.

Appendicitis,Chronic Appendicitis???,"I’m in my early twenties and I’ve had pain in my lower right side for a few months now. I brushed it off to start with because I thought it was maybe just growing pains but it’s gotten worse recently. It comes and goes it doesn’t radiate to any other parts of my stomach. It’s sometimes a dull pain but it can be pretty sharp at times. I’ve also lost my appetite (which is not like me) and lost some weight. I’ve read online and I think that a lot of my symptoms fit that of chronic appendicitis, but it’s also something that isn’t that well documented in medicine. Anyone else had a similar experience that could give me some advice? I do also have issues with my brain ladder (frequent UTIs) which I’m not sure could be causing the pain.Thanks!"
Appendicitis,Suspected early appendicitis - referred to ER. ,"For the past three days I've experienced a mild to moderate pain in my right lower quadrant that feels like a cross between a pulled muscle and gas pain. It is localized to a point between my belly button and right hip-bone. I did not suspect appendicitis because all the stories I've heard are of excruciating pain, which I do not have. Yesterday the pain became more pronounced and more localized to a single point in my right lower abdomen that radiated to my lower back. I called my local nurse-connection advice line and they advised me to be seen in urgent care as a precaution. I had also developed nausea, constipation and excessive bloating, however the pain was still more akin to a pulled muscle and was not overwhelming. The Urgent Care doctor referred me over to the ER to get a CT scan and Ultrasound because he said he suspected that I was developing appendicitis but couldn't be sure. I went to the ER last night and after waiting over two hours, decided to go home, as it was already very late, and I wasn't due to even be triaged for another two hours! I slept almost normally last night, and just felt a slight pressure/sharp twinge of pain intermittently through the night. I had a normal bowel movement this morning, but the pain is still localized to my RLQ and varies from a dull ache to a sharp, gas-like twinge. I still have mild nausea and feel like I constantly need to use the restroom. Because the pain is not overwhelming, I am hesitant to go back to the ER, but all the other symptoms of appendicitis are there. Does anyone have any advice?

Appendicitis,"Is this my appendix, or am I going insane?","Hello everyone, any input or help would be beyond helpful because I’m literally losing my mind. Everything started out about 10 days ago with a minor weird sensation in my stomach. Kinda felt like a full off feeling like I worked out to hard. This accompanied odd bowl movements & no pain. Two days past & I decided to go to a small clinic as I felt the odd sensation move to my right hip. I almost instantly knew it was something to do with my appendix. I got the okay. So I continued on with school & work but felt off. Later that week I was in the er I got a cat scan blood work ultrasound urin everything came back fine! So I moved on with this odd stomach sensation. Felt like a ball was in my stomach a fullness or something just very uncomfortable. By this point I didn’t want to eat. So the next day I went back to the er & they did the same tests blood cat scan physical test told me I had 50% of appendicitis symptoms. I got the results back & they said I was fine & it was anxiety. So I graduated from school on that Friday I felt awful stomach was upset I thought i was going to pass out when I walked across the stage but I got through it. So I thought it was nerves but I broke down that day literally freaked out started running around yelling & crying saying that there was something wrong with my appendix. I was constipated my stomach felt weird the ball feeling & now sharp right side pains on & off. Again I’m thinking appendix so I freak out all weekend had chills no fever no vomiting no nausea just weird sharp pains randomly & odd bowl movements no appetite etc. I go back to the er on Sunday night day (9) I get a cat scan blood work physical test, GI cocktail whatever that nasty thing is. & they tell me it’s because of alcohol intake & that my appendix is fine. So finally I start to think okay maybe they are right maybe it’s in my head. But now everything is full force I’m not sleeping well I have on & off sharp right side pains that last sometimes a full hour. this weird sensation in my belly button that feels like somethings poking out of it, the ball feeling in my right side kinda feels like trapped air & this nagging hip feeling like I pulled someting. Now am I losing it?is this something that I’m making up? Could all of this be me? Or could this be something serious?? I’m having mental break downs through out the day & night cry & freaking out & googling like an idiot about the possible causes, everything I mean EVERYTHING comes back as my appendix. PS sorry for the book but I really needed to get this off my chest & mind cause I feel hopeless."
Appendicitis,Appendix ,The emergency doctor informed me my appendix may burstHow do I reduce the risk
Appendicitis,Pain in left side,I had appendicts out 4 months ago. Ever since have pain in left side where one incision was keeps me up at night. When I went back to surgeon for checkup I told him. He told me I could have pain for up to a year. Is this normal
Appendicitis,Appendicular??? ,"Hi. So I had CT scan to do abdominal pain, CT came back and told me I have something called ""Appendicular"" I think? and it means that food gets stuck in my appendix, and he also told me not to worry because my appendix is not inflamed.

Appendicitis,Anxiety and Appendicitis!,"Hi everyone, I'm just looking for some advice and reassurance. I suffer from anxiety and have for a fair few years now. Lately when it comes to my health it tends to take over and make me panic. The latest thing I'm obsessing over is having appendicitis. About 3 months ago I started feeling pain in my groin area (where your leg joins your body) on my right side. I went to my doctor about it and he put it down to a pulled muscle. The pain stuck around for a little but went away. Then about a month later it came back again in the same place. I went to my doctor again and he said it can take up to 8 weeks for the muscle to repair itself and if it was still hurting after that come back and he would investigate it further. It's now at the 3 month mark and the pain is still there. It has moved though. I am getting a dull coming and going pain in my right hip and groin area now. It's constantly moving. Also when I wake up in the morning along the bottom of my back kills me but that does leave within half an hour. My anxiety has me so worked up that its my appendix that I feel like I'm feeling weird sensations along my right side stomach near my hip and just under my last rib. The same sensation is also happening along the bottom of my abdomen as I say ""under my fat roll"" There is defiantly pain there but I'm not sure if something is actually wrong or its my anxiety blowing things up in my mind. I had an x-ray on my right hip today and I'm finding out the results from my doctor tomorrow. I'm also having an ultrasound of my hip but I can't get an appointment for that for 2 weeks. I might add about 2-3 weeks before all this pain started I fell over onto concrete and landed front forward pretty hard. Im not sure if that could have affected anything. No vomiting, fever, lack of eating, none of that.Any advice or reassurance would be great because I am quietly going crazy inside my own head."
Appendicitis,Really scared about appendicitis,"Hi my name is Luke and I am 18 years old.Let me tell my story quickly-I drank last Sunday for the first time a little bit and threw up very heavily and since then the symptoms started.Loss of appetite, stomach hurting / heavy feeling in bottom right , grumbling / gassy, some back pains and even a bit of pelvic pain that hurts when I press down right above groin...I really am nervous about appendicitis, I went in 2 days ago and got Urine and Blood test and she said everything was okay, was put on some antibiotic for prostate thing.Now im just unsure "
Appendicitis,Appendicolith diagnosis before appendicitis,"My question is, once diagnosed with Appendicolith, how long could it take before appendicitis develops? I have a 4 month history of kidney stones on and around both kidneys. I've had them blasted under general anesthesia 3 times since June this year with no relief. Most pain was on my left flank. I noticed right before my last procedure about 2 and a half months ago, i started getting a pain above and beside my belly button. Shooting pain of sorts. It was off and on. I assumed it was pain due to multiple surgeries through my belly button in the past two years (one a double umbilical hernia, the other a partial hysterectomy). They both left numbness below and to the right of my belly button. About a week after the belly button pain, my stomach would swell like i was pregnant, no joke. A day or two later i began to feel a dull achy pain in my right lower side. Sometimes having a sharp pain on my lower left shooting to my lower right. Few times the pain would hurt on the lower right to the point I'd vomit. Now through my kidney stone war, i was put on a nausea med for sudden vomiting as well as high dose Norcos. I thought nothing of it as i was told this time around i had a rather large kidney stone in the lower pole of my right kidney. I go and get blasted... was fine for maybe a week, then symptons started again. Had several instances where i had the swollen belly plus huge urge to pee with only a trickle. Then about a month ago i walk into my Drs office... no appointment. She sees me, I'm in acute distress at the point, dry heaving and cant get comfy due to pain on both sides. We both assume it's stones, but she ordered a ultra sound and cat scan of both kidneys and bladder. Took over a week for the ins to ok it. I went in to get the imaging test done last Wednesday, by last Friday i recieve a call from my Drs office answering service with this message ""if you begin to have pain, go straight to ER, you are at high risk for appendicitis""! Of course i panic as, even though pain had gotten better, it was still in my right side. I went to the ER, blood test normal, no fever, no rebound pain. I was told i had a pretty good size Appendicolith seen in the scans done 2 days prior. No swelling of appendix on the scans. Dr felt i was in no need of er surgery as he stated i apparently don't have appendicitis YET... any thoughts on my chances of developing appendicitis, advice even?

Appendicitis,Is it be appendicitis? Should I visit my GP?,"About a year or two ago I got really bad pains in my abdomen which was accompanied by sweating and a list of other symptoms. I went to the hospital and was told that the pain was in my appendix but they weren't going to do anything as the pain was gone by the time I reached the hospital. For the past two days I have been throwing up. I've also had a fever, nausea and tenesmus. Today during an English assessment I had a lot of pain on my right, which moved to my left and back to my right. I tolerated it during the test and then went home. We couldn't go to the hospital right away but by the time we were ready the pain was gone again. Now, every time I eat, I feel very nauseous and have pain in what I believe to be the hypogastric reigon of my abdomen. Is what I've experienced today appendicitis and should I consult my GP or visit the emergency room. What can I do for now to relieve my discomfort?"
Appendicitis,Does this sound like chronic appendicitis ? ,"I'm hoping someone could help me and stop me worrying so much !

Appendicitis,Mild pain 1 year after appendectomy. Is this normal?,"Exactly a year ago this week I had laroscopic appendectomy. I had bouts of appendicitis for around 1 year prior to my surgery which was misdiagnosed multiple times. It was perforated when it was removed.A week later I was out of hospital and was mobile.For the last few months i've been experiencing mild (in comparison to appendicitis pain) pain in that region. This can occur when I eat certain spicy foods or when i'm tensing my abdominals. Otherwise, it can occur just when resting.My question is: is this normal or should I see a doctor to have a scan and check everything is ok?"

The reason i say this is that there seems to be some difference of opinion as to whether chronic appendicitis is a recognised condition.For over a week now i have been having some mild pain in my lower right quadrant along with rumbling stomach, mild nausea and intermittent fever/high temp/sweats.I saw my GP in the week and he suggested it could be the appendix playing up but unless it was acute discomfort it is not necessarily my appendix. I recently had a CT scan of abdomen and pelvis for something unrelated and upon reviewing it, it read, 'signs of mild thickening of the appendix wall with no inflammatory changes'. The chap reading the scan suggested this was not an issue.I am a bit confused as appadently chronic appendicitis is rare and this is clearly not acute. Not yet anyway.Has anyone had similar symptoms that either developed into acute appendicitis or that resulted in a different diagnosis.Thank you for taking the time to read this and any thoughts would be greatly appreciated..James"
Appendicitis,"High temp, fever, vomiting, cramping still 12 weeks after removal of burst appendix","So my mum had a burst appendix and it was a mess inside her. This was in January. She was misdiagnosed by 5 doctors until we refused to bring her home from a & e. They did some tests and realised so rushed to surgery and fully opened her up as key hole wasn't an option. After she then picked up a super bug and her scar became infected. Lots of antibiotics later she is over that.March 13th we had to rush her to hostpital again as she had pain near belly button, along with vomiting, fever so feeling really cold along with high temperature also cramping in stomach which she described as similar to contractions. When the cramping comes she would literally scream it's so bad. Morphine is the only thing that stops the pain.April 24th and the exact same thing again and she was taken in to hostpital again, I forgot to add that she had xrays, blood testsand a ct scan. I forgot to add the cramping is like a sharp knife inside her.Nothing showed up. We are now paying privately for a MRI scan as we don't know what else to do? Anyone have the same as this or know what is wrong with her?Please help."
Appendicitis,Chronic appendicitis or what?,"This is quite a saga but I'm getting to the point where the pain is really making me grouchy and unable to concentrate.About 2 months ago, I had severe pain in my right side, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite,rebound pain, etc. after a day or two I went to my PCP and she sent me straight to the ER. The ER did a ct scan and an ulatrs sound and blood work. They said everything was cool and sent me home with Percocet. A week later and I'm back with my PCP because I cannot tolerate eating anything and I feel so awful. She refers me to a GI. The GI orders a h pylori, an endocopy and a colonoscopy and another ultra sound. All come back ok. They then order a Hida scan which was awful and I threw up,like crazy from. It came back at 97% so fine. The GI then says you can cut it out anyways if you want .....I did not want to just start cutting organs out so I did not go see the surgeon. By this point, I've lost 15 lbs and am utterly miserable.i instead go to see an osteopath who works on me and after a day I can eat again, hooray! He says he suspects appendix since that's where I have most of the pain and he says the red flag is my lowest rib back pain. all the pain centralizes in it's original location ( lower right quad) and I'm hurting so bad by day 2 I have to stay in bed all day. Second appt comes along and it is insane painful. I cry. He says it's like pushing on a brick wall but after .5 hour he 'breaks through'. Driving home I got terrible chills and by the time I'm home I have a fever of 100. All day today I've stayed at 100 and just feel awful again, the pain is pretty intense as well. My big big worry is of course that somehow it IS my appendix but I keep being like, well if I get a high fever then I'll worry and that just never happens.....ideas, thoughts? Similar experiences?"

Appendicitis,Pain on LEFT side following appendectomy ,"Hi, Wonder if anyone has any advice. I had my appendix out just over 3 months ago. Woke up in recovery with the pain gone on right as they'd removed appendix but instead in my left side where my scar is. I'm still in agony over three months later. Work is a real struggle as I'm a teacher by the end of the day can barely walk. I am only twenty eight years old. I've had an ultra sound and they ruled out a hernia and hematoma also called a blood clot. It has been far worse than the appendix pain! It's really affecting my work but I've still being going to work full time but sometimes it bends me over double with pain. Any advice would be very much appreciated.

Doctor said I have stomach ulcer so I was having medication for stomach ulcer. After 5 days I started having lot of pain in my lower right of my stomach. I had sonography and x-ray and I was admitted to the hospital on December 17. I had CT Scan next day which revealed that I had perforated appenappendicitis. So I had open surgery in the traditional way. Doctor said I was lucky that my puss didn't spread in my intestine and they were able to remove all the puss and my appendix was in bits and pieces so they it got removed along with puss. They had attached pipe for two days to remove if any puss was there still and on the fifth day they removed the stitches on my stomach because there was hole in my intestine and it was leaking.Also, I was put on anti biotics for 2 weeks. I was discharged on the 15th day with the bag attached to my stomach to collect the leak from the hole in intestine.Its been 4 weeks now and my leak has reduced a lot, it's like 2 or 3 spoons unlike before.But healing seems to be very slow and I am bit worried.

Appendicitis,Appendicitis like pain One year after surgery,"It is now Wednesday and my symptoms started on Monday, Pain starting at my belly button which throughout the day (took around 6-8 hours) settled right over my appendix scar. This seemed very odd as I went to my GP who basically called me a liar saying my appendix had been removed, that the notes said so therefore my pain wasn't legitimate, even my parents are struggling to believe me and I really need to find the cause because I cannot eat, I don't feel hungry at all and whenever I try and eat the pain gets considerably worse, I have rebound tenderness and the pain just seems to get worse over time, my temperature has been all over the place sometimes high reached 38.6 on Monday evening then went as low as 33.9 which I find very odd. I also have been feeling very sick but as of yet I haven't been sick nor was I when I had appendicitis the first time. I want to go to hospital but because of my age (15) I cannot take myself and my parents say it can't be life threatening as I don't have my appendix anymore so I'm really stuck as to what this could be and what I should do? thanks in advance"
Appendicitis,Appendix - Confused,"6 weeks ago I had symptons of appenditicis. Went into hospital after NHS Direct advised me. Symptons included, pain by belly button then moved to lower right side. Feeling sick, loss of appetite. The pain was mild, but enough that I could not sleep, Had 4 bloods taken which resulted in increased white cells, stomach hurt more when DR took his fingers off my stomach. 4 different DRs said it was appendicitis, I questioned this as I said I can still walk and am not rolling up in pain. They operated and did not remove the appendix. Surgeon said they were not inflamed. Asked why I still had this pain, he said he does not know. Went to a hospital appointment last week and the Dr said I do have grumpling appendix but I am too healthy to have them taken out. He said that if I get a fever or vomit then I need to go into hospital to have them removed. I am still in pain, take pain killers everyday to help with the pain, constantly feeling hot, sometime feeling sick. My question is I have never heard of grumbling appendicitis, I was of the understanding that if you had appendicitis you couldnt move, rolling around in pain being sick... "

Appendicitis,"Gas pain, after appendix out.","10 days ago I had an emergency laparoscopic appendectomy and was recovering well. First bowel movement 6 days after op' after taking taking Movicol prescribed by surgeons, however was advised to up to 2 sachets instead of one and got diahhorea for few days. Pain woke me 2 nights running over appendix area so saw GP yesterday. He checked me over, no fever thankfully only bloated belly and lots of bowel noises when he listened, so came to the conclusion its wind pains. I am passing smallish amounts of wind but not enough to make a difference to pain and uncomfortable bloating. Really difficult. Bowels not moved today as yet, but the only finished with the runs yesterday. Otherwise up and about, moving reasonably well and pottering about a good bit inside home.Anyone had the same experience 10 days after surgery? Would really appreciate any remedies you took to help. Tried peppermint tea, hot water,very gentle massage of tummy., nothing seems to help.Anyreplies would be a God send, it's rally getting me down now, thanks a lot.Yvonne "

Appendicitis,?Appendix pain,"I think I may just be a hypercondriac, but for the last few days I have been getting on and off pain in my lower right side, about 2 inches from my belly button and down a bit. It is not especially painfull, just niggling, although it was sharp for a short time this morning, I have no other symptoms like fever, nausea, vomitting etc etc. If I press on the area it is quite tender.I have IBS which quite often gives me pains in my stomach, so I had imagined it was probably this, the only thing that concerns me is the tenderness on pressing on this right side, no where else is tender when I have been prodding around my stomach!Im sure I am just being paranoid, but just wondering if anyone experienced anything like this early on with appendicitis, just wanting to reassure myself really! I don't want to go and see a doctor about it as I really don't think it is anything to worry about! Any thoughts appreciated. Feel free to tell me I'm a hypercondriac!! "

The pain gets worse and worse, even to where I can't sleep at night because I'm either screaming in pain (which hurts to use my stomach muscles) or I'm vomiting. I don't have a fever. It also hurts across from my appendix in my back, but my parents say it's just poop moving. I have tried all laxatives and nothing is working. The enema only had little to nothing come out.

Appendicitis,SHARP gas pains 3 weeks after surgery,"I had my appendix removed 3 weeks ago. It ruptured slighly and I was in the hospital for a week afterward being treated with large doses of antibiotics to clear up the resulting infection. I am now experiencing very sharp gas pains in my lower stomach, mostly around the area my appendix was and lower down toward my uterus. The pressure is also on my bladder, and peeing is very uncomfortable. The pain is sharp and there is a lot of pressure inside my stomach. Is it normal to have this kind of gas pain after having your appendix removed? Also is there any way I can relieve it? The gas pain is almost as bad as the actual surgery pain was. I'm not passing wind off of the toilet, and when I go to the toilet I usually have a bowel movement which, oddly, doesn't really help the gas pain. Any help at all, anyone?"
Appendicitis,9 years after ruptured appendix still suffering,"9 years ago I got rushed to the hospital because I collapsed in stomach pain. Doctor said my appendix needed to be removed and it would be a simple 45 min surgery. Well I awoke 8 hours later to a 12 inch incision in my stomach that was pinned opened and the doctor telling me i'm lucky to be alive. Apparantly my appendix had burst a week prior to my hospital visit and the gangrene had ravaged my colon. They took out my cecum and a lot of colon and said it took about 250 stitches in my colon to hold me together. After about a 2 week hospital stay and a loss of about 50 lbs I was released and ok! Alright flash forward till now, 9 straight years I have had diarrhea I don't mean now and then I have it I mean EVERY SINGLE TIME I have used the bathroom for 9 years it has been diarrhea. I have hemroids like you wouldn't believe and they hurt like hell. When i got to go i got to go there is no waiting i have to drop what im doing and go. I get the shivers, the goosebumps as soon as i feel the need to go. Been to 5 doctors had endoscopies colonoscopies drinking dyes getting scanned. No one sees whats wrong and it cant be fixed. Is this something im going to have to live with for the rest of my life? Or does someone out there have an idea of what could help me!"
Appendicitis,12 weeks after appendix op open wound ,Hi. Had my appendix out 12 weeks ago had already burst a few days prior so was in a mess. My bowels had wrapped around the appendix and it had started to attach to the abdominal wall. Also had a gangerous pus filled cyst.

Appendicitis,Right Hemi Colectomy following Appendicitis,"Hi. My name is Jan. I have had a procedure, a Right Hemicolectomy and I am hoping someone here might be able to offer me some advice or share their experience if they too have had a Right Hemicolectomy. Just a quick background- I went in to hospital on 11-12-14 expecting nthing more than an appendectomey. When I awoke in recovery I knew something more drastic had been done and learned they had to do a Right Hemicolectomy as there was a large mass and great infection in my bowel. It was quite a shock, to say the least. They did the procedure through an open surgery and left me with about a 5 inch long incision.On Boxing day, about 3 weeks later my wound blew open and a massive amount of infection poured out. I went back to hospital where they put me under anestesia and drained the wound. They decided to leave to wound open and pack in with a dressing to let it continue to drain.The following day, a District Nurse came to the house to check the wound and when she removed the dressing the room filled with an awful odour and feacal matter was oozing out of the hole in my tummy. This too was quite a shock and very upsetting to me. Back to hospital - they checked it out and believed a fistula had formed and they reccomended using a Stoma Bag to catch the draining feacel matter. a few wekks later, I had a second infection which blew out another spot in my wound - back to hospital - treated and sent home - 2 dressings - the stoma bag and traditional packed dressing. No more feacel matter, just a beige ooze from my site. Sometimes foul smelling but not of feacel. I am now 2 months and 2 weeks post surgery. I had the stoma bag treatment end last week and am now using normal dressing though there is still a lot of output and these need changing 2-3 sometims 4 times a day. Again, outflow is light brown, sometimes smells almost what I would conisder ""Bad breathe"". Sometimes the outflow is nearly black - a very very dark brown and when this happens in is painful. Other times not so much. Phew - if you made it this far, thank you That brings me up to where I am now.I feel disheartened and find this procedure difficult to cope with in some ways because I cannot see any measurable improvement - the hole in my tummy is still draining, is still painful, it still looks the same width (about 3 cm) and I just feel like there is change or no end in sight? Can anyone else share any information, experience, advice with me that might help? I don;t understand why the outflow changes colours and why it hurts when it is dark but not when it is light in colour. How long does it take for a hole in your gut to heal?Also, my bowel functions were absolutely perfect immediately following the surger - the first 2-3 weeks or more - but now - I have at times URGENT needs to open my bowels, and feel I may not make it to the toilet. This is a worry when I am on the trains, or walking to work, etc. I have not yet returned to work yet, but still worry. This can occur 3 or 4 times a day whereas before and for my whole life, I was a one a day kinda gal. The substance is very loose, and at times painful to go and there is bright red blood on the tissue. (I do have a history of piles which were surgically repaired over a year ago).Well, thats me, inside and out.Thanks for your interest and any guidance you can offer.?Jan "
Appendicitis,help. advise please ,On Monday I started with severe cramping on the right side of my navel and lower back. Thinking this was trapped wind I just used a hot water bottle. On Tuesday it moved to my left side so I went to the doctors who did a blood test to see if it was appendicitis. Today is Wednesday and my pain has subsided a little. I'm still getting pain on my right side and very tender to touch. But isn't as bad as yesterday. I have been to the doctors for my results which have shown inflammation. She thinks it could be apendicitus. Only thing is she has sent me home with no treatment and said come back if it gets worse. I'm panicking that if it is apendicitus that it could burst as it has been 3 and a half days already. Does anyone have any advice if I should just go to the hospital or wait like the doctor said x
Appendicitis,Worried about appendicitis.. ,"So I was diagnosed roughly a month ago with post infectious IBS. Was getting bad pains mainly tucked under my right rib, Bloating, loose stools. Had a blood, urine and fecal test which all came back fine. Now, yesterday-36 hours or so ago I started noticing a kind of burning, tingling pain a bit lower down next to my hip (where I assume my appendix to be). I'm almost certain I've had this pain before in the same position over the month but it's a very different pain to the 'stitch' like pain I originally had under my rib. It's very tender to the touch and kind of hurts/burns when I touch it, but it's quite a mild pain. It sometimes randomly throbs from time to time. Worried of the worst and being a bad anxiety sufferer I immediately went to A&E and the doctor took my temperature, blood pressure which was normal.He touched over my abdomen/appendix area and used a stethoscope to listen to it and he said all that was fine. He said my appendix seemed fine but this pain is really worrying me now, how can be so sure if he didn't even run any tests? I would love to hear anyone else's opinion on this. Am I just being silly here and this is just my IBS? Thanks in advance. "

Appendicitis,Post appendicectomy - Recurrent infections ,"I'm a 29 year old female and I had my appendix removed a year ago and since have had a bad time with my health. I've constantly been getting infections, tonsillitis, chest infections, and ear infections, along with severe pain where my appendix was. I've since had my tonsils out bit the infections and pain just keeps coming. I've seen so many different specialists with regards to my abdo pain and I just get refered to someone else. I thought I was finally on the mend after being well for 6 weeks, but I spoke to soon! I've been really unwell for 3 weeks now and it getting worse! I've got a sore throat so severe I can barely swallow, on and off temperatures, ear ache, a dry cough, severe aches and pains that are sometimes dibilitating, night sweats, and head and neck pain that gets so bad it's painful to move my head, and my glands are so swollen I look like I've got no neck. I've seen 2 rubbish gp's that haven't really given me time to give them a full history and both of them have been so quick to send me away with antibiotics which have clearly not done anything. I'm just feeling really let down with drs, am so fed up with being unwell now, and I'm worried that I'm not getting any better. I just don't know where to turn to for help any more! I was contemplating going for a private health check but I just can't afford it but feel like the dr's don't take me seriously. I'm a young woman and I should be enjoying myself and my career but being unwell is taking over my life! Has anyone got any ideas what could be wrong, or what other options could be out there for me, or has anyone else suffered with similar? I'm just at my wits end now :-("
Appendicitis,"""mild"" appendicitis","Hi all,I'm looking for some reassurance that my treatment is the norm (I'm not in the UK). Last Monday I had a pain in my abdomen which developed in intensity over a period of 12 hours, I was also sick on several occasions and feeling nauseous. I phoned the on call GP who suggested an antispasmodic, which did nothing, the pain increased and my husband took me to A&E, where I was given pethidine. The first dose didn't touch the pain but following the second it subsided. The surgeons had a look and advised me I had an infection of some kind but they didn't think it was serious so they sent me home with antibiotics. I went back to work on the wednesday and during my back to work interview I mentioned that I was still feeling nauseous and dizzy so my boss told me to go see my own GP, who in turn sent me straight back to the surgeons. They started IV antibiotics, and the ultrasound showed a 'thickening' of my appendix. I was then subjected to 4 days in hospital on IV antibiotics for appendicitis, but they didn't remove the appendix. I was then discharged with a further 4 days of oral antibiotics. The pain was only ever intense on Monday, since then I have been aware that it is tender and I get the odd sharp pain in my lower right abdomen but it is just a niggle, but it is still there despite all the antibiotics. I was told that they now treat appendicitis with antibiotics in the first instance if they can.....is this true? I have a BMI of 33 and I am concerned that the whole truth is not being discussed and my weight may be the reason that they haven't rushed into emergency surgery (which is fine with me but would like to have been told) especially as a much younger (thinner) girl came in with exactly the same symptoms as me (we discussed it between ourselves) while I was in and they whipped her appendix out in a day, she ended up with a much shorter stay. There is also potential that the surgeon wanted to save face as he had said on Monday that it wasn't my appendix so for my GP to send me in 2 days later and it turn out to be my appendix makes me wonder....(possibly fueled by the fact that I really didn't like him much). I am also obviously concerned that by leaving it in they have left me at a much greater risk of a perforated appendix. Thanks any reassurance or advice will be gratefully received."
Appendicitis,Appendicitis or something else?,"Hi, I'm female, 46. For the last few months, when lying on my right side in bed reading, I get this excruciating twisting sort of bulging pain near my hip. IT feels like something is going to burst if I move. I can't think how else to describe it. When I move (in agony) it eventually subsides. For the next few days the area feels really bruised as if I've been punched. It happens every so often but is becoming more frequent, only on the right side and only when I lie in that position.I thought at first kidney pain, appendix or ovarian pain but because it's sporadic I don't think it can be.Can anyone shed any light please?"
Appendicitis,Pain and tenderness coming back after appendectomy ,"HI, I had my appendix out via keyhole surgery about 2 1/2 weeks ago. My appendix hadn't ruptured but it was chronically inflamed as I apparently had appendicitis in September but was wrongly diagnosed in hospital.Everything seemed to be healing ok and the pain was easing, but exactly 2 weeks after the op I noticed the site where my original pain was had become very sore and tender again, and I then also got what felt like muscle pain under my ribs. I saw my GP and got signed off work for a couple more days, and he sent me for urgent bloods. My bloods all came back fine but he told me to go to A&E if I was still in pain on the Saturday (yesterday) as he thought the pain should have gone by this time. The pain eased again and was fine until yesterday afternoon, after I had taken a train journey and walked more than I have for a while. Now I am very sore again. Is it possible I have just done a bit too much and strained myself? I don't want to go to A&E as the pain isn't bad enough to feel like an emergency but I really don't know what's happening. Does this sound normal? I'm really anxious and frustrated as I've been in pain since September and I thought everything would have resolved by now!"
Appendicitis,I’ve had an appendectomy and told that my appendix looked fibrous. What does that mean?,"Hi,I posted on here a few months back about my attempt to get some treatment, following months of pain from when my appendix perforated and formed an abcess, an appendix mass. I had an exploratory laproscopy a few days ago, where they found a virtually intact appendix, told me it didnt look infected, but was fibrous. they have sent it to pathology. just wondering what could this mean?Ive had the pain of appendicitis at varying levels, before and ever since it ""perforated"". I have visited a and e 6 times when my symptons have been acute and been admitted once for a bowel blockage , in my opinion as a result of the appendix affecting it since the appendix mass. I have had 3 contrast CT scans, 1 MRI , 2 xrays, 2 ultrasounds, since the perforated appendix. All have come back with results stating there is no appendix left. How can that happen?The lower gi surgical team are not keen to share too many details. having been hassling them to do something to help me for 9months , I am not their favourite patient, so I cant see them passing on much info from pathology."
Appendicitis,Appendix?,"hello i am a 28 year old female who the last few days have had loss of appetite out of no where, bloating and nausea. today i have a sharp pain that comes and goes around the area of my right ovary. Its not horrible maybe a 4.5 on a scale from 1-10. i did just finish a period about 5 days ago but starting to feel worse and worse. could this be appendix? i do not have insurance so the only option is ER so trying to avoid a huge bill if its not needed. i just worried because of the location of the pain. TIA"
Appendicitis,Feels like appendix is “grumbling” 3 months after appendix mass. What are NHS protocols?,"Hi, I got diagnosed for appendix mass, when they operated to perform what was thought to be a simple appendectomy. The hospital kept telling me that my symptons , age and reaction to pain indicated that ""it must be something else"" causing pain, its only mild appencitis. i then waited 2 days for surgery. To cut a long story short, the abcess they found was ""colossal"" and sat on top of my bowel. they could not risk removing the mass as they could have perforated my bowel.I was treated with IV antibiotics for 10 days , followed by oral antibiotics for 2 weeks. I then had a CT scan to check the area and a conoloscopy to check the bowel. both came back normal. I have my consultation with the surgeon in a few days time and really dont want to be fobbed off again. I am in considerable pain after 3 months recovery and feel as if i have low grade appencitis . what are the gold standard NHS norms for dealing with appendix mass? Some info on line points to another op to remove whats left behind, others claim its dealt with using antibiotics. What rights do I have in terms of involvement in the treatment plan?What can I push for?"

Appendicitis,Ongoing problems after Appendix removal ,"Good morning/evening! I'm hoping someone can help me or advise further, I had my appendix removed, via keyhole surgery on the 16th July. The pain was horrible! I even nearly passed out which has never happened before, no pain relief was touching the pain, even down to IV morphine. However they did mention possible ovarian cysts. Also in my urine sample it came back with ""blood present!"" After having the surgery I was admitted back in on the 22nd July for Five days as the incision in my belly button was infected (however this didn't show up on my bloods) I was treated for pain, and given antibiotics. I was in this time checked for fluid, gas still remaining and I was given a Ultrasound, X-ray and CT which I was told all were perfectly clear (please keep that in mind) I have recently got back to hospital because I am still in agony! I have pain in my right side where my appendix was, radiating upwards, also pain between my belly button incision and the left incision like a knife is cutting my up on the insides, it's awful! However they only now feel like telling me cysts were present on my ovaries, and my results from my appendix came back and I didn't have any infection or inflammation! I am stuck for words! I had another ultrasound and X-ray and apparently no cysts again? I'm in agony! I have another appointment with the hospital this Thursday and I am just confused as hell! Has anyone got issues after having the appendix removed? Or any possible other diagnosis? I will be asking them to check everything again (as mentioned I've had CT ultrasound X-ray bloods and urine checked) and it's ridiculous how this is draining me down and getting to me. I constantly feel sick, food isn't appealing to me however I eat because my mother will still force feed me to this day, the pain is enough to wake me up at night or I struggle to sleep as I sleep on my side and this is a struggle to do because of the pain. Please note through this whole time I have also had diarrhoea so they have booked me a flexible endoscopy If anyone has any suggestion? Possible help? I'm currently going to go into hospital on Thursday and I've kept a diary for pain, a book of questions and notes however any help is greatly received!"
Appendicitis,Help me out please,"So past week over I've had stomach pains upper and lower that was really painful bottom right, it went off abit on the bottom right until it randomly came on like a sharp pain asif I got stabbed I got rushed to hospital which showed a appendix mass,I've been on antibiotics for 3 days and got released from hospital today but I keep getting like a sharp twingle in that place that happens every couple of minutes is this normal or is it a sign of it not getting better? Also I have to have keyhole to remove it soon but maybe open depending on surgeon but they said most likely keyhole. What is it like having them put tubes down your throat ect and what is it like being put to sleep and waking up? (I'm 20) and have never had anything done before and I'm really scared about it. Thanks for any replies"
Appendicitis,Worried I might have appendicitis,"Okay, so for the past few weeks I have been having some mild pain underneath both of my breasts, on the ribs. It wasn't really bothersome.

Now, I'm just feeling it in my right side. There is a little bit of pain and some discomfort. I had quite a few people press down on where it hurts and it doesn't hurt any worse when they removed their hand. I had a blood and urine test done at the emergency room a couple of days ago and that was all normal. No CT scan. I'm very worried and am not sure what is going on. Could someone please help me out here? I am so scared there may be something seriously wrong. ? Oh, and I should also mention that the pain comes and goes, been occurring in random areas around my right abdomen, some in the front but not much, and around the ribs.

Appendicitis,Pain 2 weeks after Appendectomy.,"I'm a 19 year old female. So about 2 weeks ago, I had key hole surgery to remove my appendix. There was nothing wrong with my appendix but the doctors had no idea what was causing my pain so they took it out anyway, after finding there were no other problems causing my symptoms. I had a urine infection at the same time but it wasn't causing my sharp lower abdomen pain. Now after surgery, I'm starting to get a few of my old symptoms back, but its not constant. Its things like back pain, stomach aches, tiredness, stabbing pain just above my right hip and headaches all the time!! The pain is no where near as bad as it was before surgery but my painkillers aren't working and I'm in pain and uncomfortable. what should I do?I'm a 19 year old female.

Appendicitis,Chronic Appendicitis???,"I’m in my early twenties and I’ve had pain in my lower right side for a few months now. I brushed it off to start with because I thought it was maybe just growing pains but it’s gotten worse recently. It comes and goes it doesn’t radiate to any other parts of my stomach. It’s sometimes a dull pain but it can be pretty sharp at times. I’ve also lost my appetite (which is not like me) and lost some weight. I’ve read online and I think that a lot of my symptoms fit that of chronic appendicitis, but it’s also something that isn’t that well documented in medicine. Anyone else had a similar experience that could give me some advice? I do also have issues with my brain ladder (frequent UTIs) which I’m not sure could be causing the pain.Thanks!"
Appendicitis,Suspected early appendicitis - referred to ER. ,"For the past three days I've experienced a mild to moderate pain in my right lower quadrant that feels like a cross between a pulled muscle and gas pain. It is localized to a point between my belly button and right hip-bone. I did not suspect appendicitis because all the stories I've heard are of excruciating pain, which I do not have. Yesterday the pain became more pronounced and more localized to a single point in my right lower abdomen that radiated to my lower back. I called my local nurse-connection advice line and they advised me to be seen in urgent care as a precaution. I had also developed nausea, constipation and excessive bloating, however the pain was still more akin to a pulled muscle and was not overwhelming. The Urgent Care doctor referred me over to the ER to get a CT scan and Ultrasound because he said he suspected that I was developing appendicitis but couldn't be sure. I went to the ER last night and after waiting over two hours, decided to go home, as it was already very late, and I wasn't due to even be triaged for another two hours! I slept almost normally last night, and just felt a slight pressure/sharp twinge of pain intermittently through the night. I had a normal bowel movement this morning, but the pain is still localized to my RLQ and varies from a dull ache to a sharp, gas-like twinge. I still have mild nausea and feel like I constantly need to use the restroom. Because the pain is not overwhelming, I am hesitant to go back to the ER, but all the other symptoms of appendicitis are there. Does anyone have any advice?

Appendicitis,"Is this my appendix, or am I going insane?","Hello everyone, any input or help would be beyond helpful because I’m literally losing my mind. Everything started out about 10 days ago with a minor weird sensation in my stomach. Kinda felt like a full off feeling like I worked out to hard. This accompanied odd bowl movements & no pain. Two days past & I decided to go to a small clinic as I felt the odd sensation move to my right hip. I almost instantly knew it was something to do with my appendix. I got the okay. So I continued on with school & work but felt off. Later that week I was in the er I got a cat scan blood work ultrasound urin everything came back fine! So I moved on with this odd stomach sensation. Felt like a ball was in my stomach a fullness or something just very uncomfortable. By this point I didn’t want to eat. So the next day I went back to the er & they did the same tests blood cat scan physical test told me I had 50% of appendicitis symptoms. I got the results back & they said I was fine & it was anxiety. So I graduated from school on that Friday I felt awful stomach was upset I thought i was going to pass out when I walked across the stage but I got through it. So I thought it was nerves but I broke down that day literally freaked out started running around yelling & crying saying that there was something wrong with my appendix. I was constipated my stomach felt weird the ball feeling & now sharp right side pains on & off. Again I’m thinking appendix so I freak out all weekend had chills no fever no vomiting no nausea just weird sharp pains randomly & odd bowl movements no appetite etc. I go back to the er on Sunday night day (9) I get a cat scan blood work physical test, GI cocktail whatever that nasty thing is. & they tell me it’s because of alcohol intake & that my appendix is fine. So finally I start to think okay maybe they are right maybe it’s in my head. But now everything is full force I’m not sleeping well I have on & off sharp right side pains that last sometimes a full hour. this weird sensation in my belly button that feels like somethings poking out of it, the ball feeling in my right side kinda feels like trapped air & this nagging hip feeling like I pulled someting. Now am I losing it?is this something that I’m making up? Could all of this be me? Or could this be something serious?? I’m having mental break downs through out the day & night cry & freaking out & googling like an idiot about the possible causes, everything I mean EVERYTHING comes back as my appendix. PS sorry for the book but I really needed to get this off my chest & mind cause I feel hopeless."
Appendicitis,Appendix ,The emergency doctor informed me my appendix may burstHow do I reduce the risk

Appendicitis,Anxiety and Appendicitis!,"Hi everyone, I'm just looking for some advice and reassurance. I suffer from anxiety and have for a fair few years now. Lately when it comes to my health it tends to take over and make me panic. The latest thing I'm obsessing over is having appendicitis. About 3 months ago I started feeling pain in my groin area (where your leg joins your body) on my right side. I went to my doctor about it and he put it down to a pulled muscle. The pain stuck around for a little but went away. Then about a month later it came back again in the same place. I went to my doctor again and he said it can take up to 8 weeks for the muscle to repair itself and if it was still hurting after that come back and he would investigate it further. It's now at the 3 month mark and the pain is still there. It has moved though. I am getting a dull coming and going pain in my right hip and groin area now. It's constantly moving. Also when I wake up in the morning along the bottom of my back kills me but that does leave within half an hour. My anxiety has me so worked up that its my appendix that I feel like I'm feeling weird sensations along my right side stomach near my hip and just under my last rib. The same sensation is also happening along the bottom of my abdomen as I say ""under my fat roll"" There is defiantly pain there but I'm not sure if something is actually wrong or its my anxiety blowing things up in my mind. I had an x-ray on my right hip today and I'm finding out the results from my doctor tomorrow. I'm also having an ultrasound of my hip but I can't get an appointment for that for 2 weeks. I might add about 2-3 weeks before all this pain started I fell over onto concrete and landed front forward pretty hard. Im not sure if that could have affected anything. No vomiting, fever, lack of eating, none of that.Any advice or reassurance would be great because I am quietly going crazy inside my own head."
Appendicitis,Really scared about appendicitis,"Hi my name is Luke and I am 18 years old.Let me tell my story quickly-I drank last Sunday for the first time a little bit and threw up very heavily and since then the symptoms started.Loss of appetite, stomach hurting / heavy feeling in bottom right , grumbling / gassy, some back pains and even a bit of pelvic pain that hurts when I press down right above groin...I really am nervous about appendicitis, I went in 2 days ago and got Urine and Blood test and she said everything was okay, was put on some antibiotic for prostate thing.Now im just unsure "
Appendicitis,Appendicolith diagnosis before appendicitis,"My question is, once diagnosed with Appendicolith, how long could it take before appendicitis develops? I have a 4 month history of kidney stones on and around both kidneys. I've had them blasted under general anesthesia 3 times since June this year with no relief. Most pain was on my left flank. I noticed right before my last procedure about 2 and a half months ago, i started getting a pain above and beside my belly button. Shooting pain of sorts. It was off and on. I assumed it was pain due to multiple surgeries through my belly button in the past two years (one a double umbilical hernia, the other a partial hysterectomy). They both left numbness below and to the right of my belly button. About a week after the belly button pain, my stomach would swell like i was pregnant, no joke. A day or two later i began to feel a dull achy pain in my right lower side. Sometimes having a sharp pain on my lower left shooting to my lower right. Few times the pain would hurt on the lower right to the point I'd vomit. Now through my kidney stone war, i was put on a nausea med for sudden vomiting as well as high dose Norcos. I thought nothing of it as i was told this time around i had a rather large kidney stone in the lower pole of my right kidney. I go and get blasted... was fine for maybe a week, then symptons started again. Had several instances where i had the swollen belly plus huge urge to pee with only a trickle. Then about a month ago i walk into my Drs office... no appointment. She sees me, I'm in acute distress at the point, dry heaving and cant get comfy due to pain on both sides. We both assume it's stones, but she ordered a ultra sound and cat scan of both kidneys and bladder. Took over a week for the ins to ok it. I went in to get the imaging test done last Wednesday, by last Friday i recieve a call from my Drs office answering service with this message ""if you begin to have pain, go straight to ER, you are at high risk for appendicitis""! Of course i panic as, even though pain had gotten better, it was still in my right side. I went to the ER, blood test normal, no fever, no rebound pain. I was told i had a pretty good size Appendicolith seen in the scans done 2 days prior. No swelling of appendix on the scans. Dr felt i was in no need of er surgery as he stated i apparently don't have appendicitis YET... any thoughts on my chances of developing appendicitis, advice even?

Appendicitis,Is it be appendicitis? Should I visit my GP?,"About a year or two ago I got really bad pains in my abdomen which was accompanied by sweating and a list of other symptoms. I went to the hospital and was told that the pain was in my appendix but they weren't going to do anything as the pain was gone by the time I reached the hospital. For the past two days I have been throwing up. I've also had a fever, nausea and tenesmus. Today during an English assessment I had a lot of pain on my right, which moved to my left and back to my right. I tolerated it during the test and then went home. We couldn't go to the hospital right away but by the time we were ready the pain was gone again. Now, every time I eat, I feel very nauseous and have pain in what I believe to be the hypogastric reigon of my abdomen. Is what I've experienced today appendicitis and should I consult my GP or visit the emergency room. What can I do for now to relieve my discomfort?"
Appendicitis,Does this sound like chronic appendicitis ? ,"I'm hoping someone could help me and stop me worrying so much ! For the past four months I have been getting pain in my right hip radiating towards the back , in the groin area and also down my leg , my hip feels like it locks at times and pops and it's then really painful I have been to the doctors and he said it sounds like its muscular and to come back if it got worse doing my own research online I think it sounds very similar to sciatica . However with the hip pain I have also had weird pains in tummy it's kind of a sharp pain that comes and goes it last from like 5 seconds to about 30 seconds I feel the pain on both the left and the right side but more on the right which is why I'm asking about appendicitis ! I suffer really badly with anxiety , OCD and also IBS and everytime I get the pain in my belly I go into complete panic mode and I have even worked myself up so much over the pain being appendicitis that I have had a panic attack ! I haven't had any of symptoms of appendicitis but I'm do scared ! I just wondered what you guys thought ! Sorry it's so long trying to explain myself as well as I can I'm hoping someone could help me and stop me worrying so much ! For the past four months I have been getting pain in my right hip radiating towards the back , in the groin area and also down my leg , my hip feels like it locks at times and pops and it's then really painful I have been to the doctors and he said it sounds like its muscular and to come back if it got worse doing my own research online I think it sounds very similar to sciatica . However with the hip pain I have also had weird pains in tummy it's kind of a sharp pain that comes and goes it last from like 5 seconds to about 30 seconds I feel the pain on both the left and the right side but more on the right which is why I'm asking about appendicitis ! I suffer really badly with anxiety , OCD and also IBS and everytime I get the pain in my belly I go into complete panic mode and I have even worked myself up so much over the pain being appendicitis that I have had a panic attack ! I haven't had any of symptoms of appendicitis but I'm do scared ! I just wondered what you guys thought ! Sorry it's so long trying to explain myself as well as I can , should have added that when I went doctors he had a really good feel of my tummy and got me to do things like touch my toes to see if it made the pain come which it didn't"
Appendicitis,Mild pain 1 year after appendectomy. Is this normal?,"Exactly a year ago this week I had laroscopic appendectomy. I had bouts of appendicitis for around 1 year prior to my surgery which was misdiagnosed multiple times. It was perforated when it was removed.A week later I was out of hospital and was mobile.For the last few months i've been experiencing mild (in comparison to appendicitis pain) pain in that region. This can occur when I eat certain spicy foods or when i'm tensing my abdominals. Otherwise, it can occur just when resting.My question is: is this normal or should I see a doctor to have a scan and check everything is ok?"
Appendicitis,IBS and appendectomy,"For the longest time I've had IBS, but when my abdominal pain became worse I recently had an emergency appendectomy.

Appendicitis,Suspected Appendicitis,"Hi I am trying to work out if i have chronic appendicitis. The reason i say this is that there seems to be some difference of opinion as to whether chronic appendicitis is a recognised condition.For over a week now i have been having some mild pain in my lower right quadrant along with rumbling stomach, mild nausea and intermittent fever/high temp/sweats.I saw my GP in the week and he suggested it could be the appendix playing up but unless it was acute discomfort it is not necessarily my appendix. I recently had a CT scan of abdomen and pelvis for something unrelated and upon reviewing it, it read, 'signs of mild thickening of the appendix wall with no inflammatory changes'. The chap reading the scan suggested this was not an issue.I am a bit confused as appadently chronic appendicitis is rare and this is clearly not acute. Not yet anyway.Has anyone had similar symptoms that either developed into acute appendicitis or that resulted in a different diagnosis.Thank you for taking the time to read this and any thoughts would be greatly appreciated..James"
Appendicitis,"High temp, fever, vomiting, cramping still 12 weeks after removal of burst appendix","So my mum had a burst appendix and it was a mess inside her. This was in January. She was misdiagnosed by 5 doctors until we refused to bring her home from a & e. They did some tests and realised so rushed to surgery and fully opened her up as key hole wasn't an option. After she then picked up a super bug and her scar became infected. Lots of antibiotics later she is over that.March 13th we had to rush her to hostpital again as she had pain near belly button, along with vomiting, fever so feeling really cold along with high temperature also cramping in stomach which she described as similar to contractions. When the cramping comes she would literally scream it's so bad. Morphine is the only thing that stops the pain.April 24th and the exact same thing again and she was taken in to hostpital again, I forgot to add that she had xrays, blood testsand a ct scan. I forgot to add the cramping is like a sharp knife inside her.Nothing showed up. We are now paying privately for a MRI scan as we don't know what else to do? Anyone have the same as this or know what is wrong with her?Please help."
Appendicitis,Chronic appendicitis or what?,"This is quite a saga but I'm getting to the point where the pain is really making me grouchy and unable to concentrate.About 2 months ago, I had severe pain in my right side, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite,rebound pain, etc. after a day or two I went to my PCP and she sent me straight to the ER. The ER did a ct scan and an ulatrs sound and blood work. They said everything was cool and sent me home with Percocet. A week later and I'm back with my PCP because I cannot tolerate eating anything and I feel so awful. She refers me to a GI. The GI orders a h pylori, an endocopy and a colonoscopy and another ultra sound. All come back ok. They then order a Hida scan which was awful and I threw up,like crazy from. It came back at 97% so fine. The GI then says you can cut it out anyways if you want .....I did not want to just start cutting organs out so I did not go see the surgeon. By this point, I've lost 15 lbs and am utterly miserable.i instead go to see an osteopath who works on me and after a day I can eat again, hooray! He says he suspects appendix since that's where I have most of the pain and he says the red flag is my lowest rib back pain. all the pain centralizes in it's original location ( lower right quad) and I'm hurting so bad by day 2 I have to stay in bed all day. Second appt comes along and it is insane painful. I cry. He says it's like pushing on a brick wall but after .5 hour he 'breaks through'. Driving home I got terrible chills and by the time I'm home I have a fever of 100. All day today I've stayed at 100 and just feel awful again, the pain is pretty intense as well. My big big worry is of course that somehow it IS my appendix but I keep being like, well if I get a high fever then I'll worry and that just never happens.....ideas, thoughts? Similar experiences?"

Appendicitis,Pain on LEFT side following appendectomy ,"Hi, Wonder if anyone has any advice. I had my appendix out just over 3 months ago.

Work is a real struggle as I'm a teacher by the end of the day can barely walk. I am only twenty eight years old. I've had an ultra sound and they ruled out a hernia and hematoma also called a blood clot. It has been far worse than the appendix pain! It's really affecting my work but I've still being going to work full time but sometimes it bends me over double with pain. Any advice would be very much appreciated.

Doctor said I have stomach ulcer so I was having medication for stomach ulcer. After 5 days I started having lot of pain in my lower right of my stomach. I had sonography and x-ray and I was admitted to the hospital on December 17. I had CT Scan next day which revealed that I had perforated appenappendicitis. So I had open surgery in the traditional way. Doctor said I was lucky that my puss didn't spread in my intestine and they were able to remove all the puss and my appendix was in bits and pieces so they it got removed along with puss. They had attached pipe for two days to remove if any puss was there still and on the fifth day they removed the stitches on my stomach because there was hole in my intestine and it was leaking.Also, I was put on anti biotics for 2 weeks. I was discharged on the 15th day with the bag attached to my stomach to collect the leak from the hole in intestine.Its been 4 weeks now and my leak has reduced a lot, it's like 2 or 3 spoons unlike before.But healing seems to be very slow and I am bit worried.

Appendicitis,Appendicitis like pain One year after surgery,"It is now Wednesday and my symptoms started on Monday, Pain starting at my belly button which throughout the day (took around 6-8 hours) settled right over my appendix scar. This seemed very odd as I went to my GP who basically called me a liar saying my appendix had been removed, that the notes said so therefore my pain wasn't legitimate, even my parents are struggling to believe me and I really need to find the cause because I cannot eat, I don't feel hungry at all and whenever I try and eat the pain gets considerably worse, I have rebound tenderness and the pain just seems to get worse over time, my temperature has been all over the place sometimes high reached 38.6 on Monday evening then went as low as 33.9 which I find very odd. I also have been feeling very sick but as of yet I haven't been sick nor was I when I had appendicitis the first time. I want to go to hospital but because of my age (15) I cannot take myself and my parents say it can't be life threatening as I don't have my appendix anymore so I'm really stuck as to what this could be and what I should do? thanks in advance"
Appendicitis,Appendix - Confused,"6 weeks ago I had symptons of appenditicis. Went into hospital after NHS Direct advised me. Symptons included, pain by belly button then moved to lower right side. Feeling sick, loss of appetite. The pain was mild, but enough that I could not sleep, Had 4 bloods taken which resulted in increased white cells, stomach hurt more when DR took his fingers off my stomach. 4 different DRs said it was appendicitis, I questioned this as I said I can still walk and am not rolling up in pain. They operated and did not remove the appendix. Surgeon said they were not inflamed. Asked why I still had this pain, he said he does not know. Went to a hospital appointment last week and the Dr said I do have grumpling appendix but I am too healthy to have them taken out. He said that if I get a fever or vomit then I need to go into hospital to have them removed. I am still in pain, take pain killers everyday to help with the pain, constantly feeling hot, sometime feeling sick. My question is I have never heard of grumbling appendicitis, I was of the understanding that if you had appendicitis you couldnt move, rolling around in pain being sick... "

Appendicitis,"Gas pain, after appendix out.","10 days ago I had an emergency laparoscopic appendectomy and was recovering well. First bowel movement 6 days after op' after taking taking Movicol prescribed by surgeons, however was advised to up to 2 sachets instead of one and got diahhorea for few days. Pain woke me 2 nights running over appendix area so saw GP yesterday. He checked me over, no fever thankfully only bloated belly and lots of bowel noises when he listened, so came to the conclusion its wind pains. I am passing smallish amounts of wind but not enough to make a difference to pain and uncomfortable bloating. Really difficult. Bowels not moved today as yet, but the only finished with the runs yesterday. Otherwise up and about, moving reasonably well and pottering about a good bit inside home.Anyone had the same experience 10 days after surgery? Would really appreciate any remedies you took to help. Tried peppermint tea, hot water,very gentle massage of tummy., nothing seems to help.Anyreplies would be a God send, it's rally getting me down now, thanks a lot.Yvonne "

Appendicitis,?Appendix pain,"I think I may just be a hypercondriac, but for the last few days I have been getting on and off pain in my lower right side, about 2 inches from my belly button and down a bit. It is not especially painfull, just niggling, although it was sharp for a short time this morning, I have no other symptoms like fever, nausea, vomitting etc etc. If I press on the area it is quite tender.I have IBS which quite often gives me pains in my stomach, so I had imagined it was probably this, the only thing that concerns me is the tenderness on pressing on this right side, no where else is tender when I have been prodding around my stomach!Im sure I am just being paranoid, but just wondering if anyone experienced anything like this early on with appendicitis, just wanting to reassure myself really! I don't want to go and see a doctor about it as I really don't think it is anything to worry about! Any thoughts appreciated. Feel free to tell me I'm a hypercondriac!! "

Appendicitis,I got checked for appendicitis but I have the symptoms and I'm in a lot of pain ,"I was checked for appendicitis and was told that my appendix is normal.

The pain gets worse and worse, even to where I can't sleep at night because I'm either screaming in pain (which hurts to use my stomach muscles) or I'm vomiting. I don't have a fever. It also hurts across from my appendix in my back, but my parents say it's just poop moving. I have tried all laxatives and nothing is working. The enema only had little to nothing come out.

Appendicitis,SHARP gas pains 3 weeks after surgery,"I had my appendix removed 3 weeks ago. It ruptured slighly and I was in the hospital for a week afterward being treated with large doses of antibiotics to clear up the resulting infection. I am now experiencing very sharp gas pains in my lower stomach, mostly around the area my appendix was and lower down toward my uterus. The pressure is also on my bladder, and peeing is very uncomfortable. The pain is sharp and there is a lot of pressure inside my stomach. Is it normal to have this kind of gas pain after having your appendix removed? Also is there any way I can relieve it? The gas pain is almost as bad as the actual surgery pain was. I'm not passing wind off of the toilet, and when I go to the toilet I usually have a bowel movement which, oddly, doesn't really help the gas pain. Any help at all, anyone?"
Appendicitis,9 years after ruptured appendix still suffering,"9 years ago I got rushed to the hospital because I collapsed in stomach pain. Doctor said my appendix needed to be removed and it would be a simple 45 min surgery. Well I awoke 8 hours later to a 12 inch incision in my stomach that was pinned opened and the doctor telling me i'm lucky to be alive. Apparantly my appendix had burst a week prior to my hospital visit and the gangrene had ravaged my colon. They took out my cecum and a lot of colon and said it took about 250 stitches in my colon to hold me together. After about a 2 week hospital stay and a loss of about 50 lbs I was released and ok! Alright flash forward till now, 9 straight years I have had diarrhea I don't mean now and then I have it I mean EVERY SINGLE TIME I have used the bathroom for 9 years it has been diarrhea. I have hemroids like you wouldn't believe and they hurt like hell. When i got to go i got to go there is no waiting i have to drop what im doing and go. I get the shivers, the goosebumps as soon as i feel the need to go. Been to 5 doctors had endoscopies colonoscopies drinking dyes getting scanned. No one sees whats wrong and it cant be fixed. Is this something im going to have to live with for the rest of my life? Or does someone out there have an idea of what could help me!"
Appendicitis,12 weeks after appendix op open wound ,Hi. Had my appendix out 12 weeks ago had already burst a few days prior so was in a mess.

Appendicitis,Right Hemi Colectomy following Appendicitis,"Hi. My name is Jan. I have had a procedure, a Right Hemicolectomy and I am hoping someone here might be able to offer me some advice or share their experience if they too have had a Right Hemicolectomy. Just a quick background- I went in to hospital on 11-12-14 expecting nthing more than an appendectomey. When I awoke in recovery I knew something more drastic had been done and learned they had to do a Right Hemicolectomy as there was a large mass and great infection in my bowel. It was quite a shock, to say the least. They did the procedure through an open surgery and left me with about a 5 inch long incision.On Boxing day, about 3 weeks later my wound blew open and a massive amount of infection poured out. I went back to hospital where they put me under anestesia and drained the wound. They decided to leave to wound open and pack in with a dressing to let it continue to drain.The following day, a District Nurse came to the house to check the wound and when she removed the dressing the room filled with an awful odour and feacal matter was oozing out of the hole in my tummy. This too was quite a shock and very upsetting to me. Back to hospital - they checked it out and believed a fistula had formed and they reccomended using a Stoma Bag to catch the draining feacel matter. a few wekks later, I had a second infection which blew out another spot in my wound - back to hospital - treated and sent home - 2 dressings - the stoma bag and traditional packed dressing. No more feacel matter, just a beige ooze from my site. Sometimes foul smelling but not of feacel. I am now 2 months and 2 weeks post surgery. I had the stoma bag treatment end last week and am now using normal dressing though there is still a lot of output and these need changing 2-3 sometims 4 times a day. Again, outflow is light brown, sometimes smells almost what I would conisder ""Bad breathe"". Sometimes the outflow is nearly black - a very very dark brown and when this happens in is painful. Other times not so much. Phew - if you made it this far, thank you That brings me up to where I am now.I feel disheartened and find this procedure difficult to cope with in some ways because I cannot see any measurable improvement - the hole in my tummy is still draining, is still painful, it still looks the same width (about 3 cm) and I just feel like there is change or no end in sight? Can anyone else share any information, experience, advice with me that might help? I don;t understand why the outflow changes colours and why it hurts when it is dark but not when it is light in colour. How long does it take for a hole in your gut to heal?Also, my bowel functions were absolutely perfect immediately following the surger - the first 2-3 weeks or more - but now - I have at times URGENT needs to open my bowels, and feel I may not make it to the toilet. This is a worry when I am on the trains, or walking to work, etc. I have not yet returned to work yet, but still worry. This can occur 3 or 4 times a day whereas before and for my whole life, I was a one a day kinda gal. The substance is very loose, and at times painful to go and there is bright red blood on the tissue. (I do have a history of piles which were surgically repaired over a year ago).Well, thats me, inside and out.Thanks for your interest and any guidance you can offer.?Jan "
Appendicitis,help. advise please ,On Monday I started with severe cramping on the right side of my navel and lower back. Thinking this was trapped wind I just used a hot water bottle. On Tuesday it moved to my left side so I went to the doctors who did a blood test to see if it was appendicitis. Today is Wednesday and my pain has subsided a little. I'm still getting pain on my right side and very tender to touch. But isn't as bad as yesterday. I have been to the doctors for my results which have shown inflammation. She thinks it could be apendicitus. Only thing is she has sent me home with no treatment and said come back if it gets worse. I'm panicking that if it is apendicitus that it could burst as it has been 3 and a half days already. Does anyone have any advice if I should just go to the hospital or wait like the doctor said x
Appendicitis,Worried about appendicitis.. ,"So I was diagnosed roughly a month ago with post infectious IBS. Was getting bad pains mainly tucked under my right rib, Bloating, loose stools. Had a blood, urine and fecal test which all came back fine. Now, yesterday-36 hours or so ago I started noticing a kind of burning, tingling pain a bit lower down next to my hip (where I assume my appendix to be). I'm almost certain I've had this pain before in the same position over the month but it's a very different pain to the 'stitch' like pain I originally had under my rib. It's very tender to the touch and kind of hurts/burns when I touch it, but it's quite a mild pain. It sometimes randomly throbs from time to time. Worried of the worst and being a bad anxiety sufferer I immediately went to A&E and the doctor took my temperature, blood pressure which was normal.He touched over my abdomen/appendix area and used a stethoscope to listen to it and he said all that was fine. He said my appendix seemed fine but this pain is really worrying me now, how can be so sure if he didn't even run any tests? I would love to hear anyone else's opinion on this.

Appendicitis,Post appendicectomy - Recurrent infections ,"I'm a 29 year old female and I had my appendix removed a year ago and since have had a bad time with my health. I've constantly been getting infections, tonsillitis, chest infections, and ear infections, along with severe pain where my appendix was. I've since had my tonsils out bit the infections and pain just keeps coming. I've seen so many different specialists with regards to my abdo pain and I just get refered to someone else. I thought I was finally on the mend after being well for 6 weeks, but I spoke to soon! I've been really unwell for 3 weeks now and it getting worse! I've got a sore throat so severe I can barely swallow, on and off temperatures, ear ache, a dry cough, severe aches and pains that are sometimes dibilitating, night sweats, and head and neck pain that gets so bad it's painful to move my head, and my glands are so swollen I look like I've got no neck. I've seen 2 rubbish gp's that haven't really given me time to give them a full history and both of them have been so quick to send me away with antibiotics which have clearly not done anything. I'm just feeling really let down with drs, am so fed up with being unwell now, and I'm worried that I'm not getting any better. I just don't know where to turn to for help any more! I was contemplating going for a private health check but I just can't afford it but feel like the dr's don't take me seriously. I'm a young woman and I should be enjoying myself and my career but being unwell is taking over my life! Has anyone got any ideas what could be wrong, or what other options could be out there for me, or has anyone else suffered with similar? I'm just at my wits end now :-("
Appendicitis,"""mild"" appendicitis","Hi all,I'm looking for some reassurance that my treatment is the norm (I'm not in the UK). Last Monday I had a pain in my abdomen which developed in intensity over a period of 12 hours, I was also sick on several occasions and feeling nauseous. I phoned the on call GP who suggested an antispasmodic, which did nothing, the pain increased and my husband took me to A&E, where I was given pethidine. The first dose didn't touch the pain but following the second it subsided. The surgeons had a look and advised me I had an infection of some kind but they didn't think it was serious so they sent me home with antibiotics. I went back to work on the wednesday and during my back to work interview I mentioned that I was still feeling nauseous and dizzy so my boss told me to go see my own GP, who in turn sent me straight back to the surgeons. They started IV antibiotics, and the ultrasound showed a 'thickening' of my appendix. I was then subjected to 4 days in hospital on IV antibiotics for appendicitis, but they didn't remove the appendix. I was then discharged with a further 4 days of oral antibiotics. The pain was only ever intense on Monday, since then I have been aware that it is tender and I get the odd sharp pain in my lower right abdomen but it is just a niggle, but it is still there despite all the antibiotics. I was told that they now treat appendicitis with antibiotics in the first instance if they can.....is this true? I have a BMI of 33 and I am concerned that the whole truth is not being discussed and my weight may be the reason that they haven't rushed into emergency surgery (which is fine with me but would like to have been told) especially as a much younger (thinner) girl came in with exactly the same symptoms as me (we discussed it between ourselves) while I was in and they whipped her appendix out in a day, she ended up with a much shorter stay. There is also potential that the surgeon wanted to save face as he had said on Monday that it wasn't my appendix so for my GP to send me in 2 days later and it turn out to be my appendix makes me wonder....(possibly fueled by the fact that I really didn't like him much). I am also obviously concerned that by leaving it in they have left me at a much greater risk of a perforated appendix. Thanks any reassurance or advice will be gratefully received."
Appendicitis,Appendicitis or something else?,"Hi, I'm female, 46. For the last few months, when lying on my right side in bed reading, I get this excruciating twisting sort of bulging pain near my hip. IT feels like something is going to burst if I move. I can't think how else to describe it. When I move (in agony) it eventually subsides. For the next few days the area feels really bruised as if I've been punched. It happens every so often but is becoming more frequent, only on the right side and only when I lie in that position.I thought at first kidney pain, appendix or ovarian pain but because it's sporadic I don't think it can be.Can anyone shed any light please?"
