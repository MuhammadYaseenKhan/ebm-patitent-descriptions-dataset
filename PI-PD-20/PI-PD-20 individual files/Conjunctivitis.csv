Conjunctivitis,Flashing in eye,"Hi, a couple of days ago i noticed a flashing in the corner of my right eye in the evening while watching tv. I didnt think much of if but ive noticed it everyday since. I suffer from terrible health anxiety and im so scared this is something serious. It doesnt happen all the time just every now and again 1-3 flashes. No change in vision or floaters. Im 34 type 2 diabetic diagnosed a year ago with an Hba1c of 56 reduced to 38 within 3 months. Had my screening at the hospital in august and was told everything was good. Routine eye test a few months ago was fine and healthy. My dad did have a retinal detachment a few years ago so as im sure you can imagine that is playing in my mind, though he had had floaters for many years and recent caterach surgery when it happened.My eye feels very dry and sore but im sure thats just me being super aware if it.Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated."
Conjunctivitis,Possibilities of sjögren's syndrome or other related conditions,"hi all,i developed left eye dry eye two years ago after having many episodes of panic attacks. since panic attacks cause some sort of immune dysfunction or nerve dysfunction in the body, i would like to know if i would be suffering from sjögren's syndrome or any other related condition. it has been two years and i have not been able to cure my left eye dry eye. what makes me feel why i might be suffering from sjögren's or any other related condition is that only my left eye is affected and not right. i would also like to let you know that my left nose inferior turbinate is slightly damaged and reduced as the turbinate has turned white due to an experience last year (after smelling spices to reduce turbinate swelling). this nose condition could also be contributing i believe.your help would be greatly appreciated.neel."
Conjunctivitis,Black flashes in peripheral vision of right eye,"Hi,I'm a 17 year old girl. I'm pretty certain (like 98%) I'm fairly nearsighted but I've never gotten an official eye exam to confirm it. A couple of days ago, after being outside and then returning inside, I started having black flashes in the peripheral vision of my right eye. They last for less than one second, and I don't have blurry vision or any other kind of vision loss symptoms. The flashes do not happen that often, maybe like 10-12 times a day. My eye does kind of feel dry and I feel kind of like a pressure behind my eye. It feels like it's not as frequent during the day or when I'm with people, strangely. I don't know what could have caused this. I have a significant amount of health anxiety surrounding this and am very worried. What could this be?"
Conjunctivitis,"I feel spaced out, drunk/high 24/7","I've felt like this for about 3 weeks now. It hit me like a bus. One day I was perfectly fine, and then the next I felt like I was half way through my 10th pint on a Friday night. And it hasn't stopped since.I feel spaced out, I struggle to concentrate on things. It's really hard to explain, but my vision seems to focus intensely on one object (like an up close macro photograph) & then everything else around me seems to fall away.I can still function day to day. I can still talk to people, walk/run, make food etc. but I constantly feel drunk/high.I've got exams coming up within literally weeks and this just cannot continue in to that period.I don't know what to do. Welcome any suggestions. Thanks.PS: I've never been on any medication before and blood pressure etc. are all fine. All good in the health department."

Conjunctivitis,Castor Oil for dry eyes. ,"Has anyone tried castor oil for dry eyes? I have read and heard so many positive things about it and it has really helped some people with dry eyes, red eyes ect ect,,,, i have dry eyes and have tried lots of drops that the doctors gave me and none helped and some even caused the delicate skin aroud my eyes burn and sting. I am thinking of trying castor oil as its natural too!."
Conjunctivitis,Light Shows in the dark,"when I am in my darkroom using cellphone laying down I keep seeing green and purple lights around cellphone screen. But this doesn't happen everytime, sometimes without using cellphone in darkness with my eyes opened I see green waves like Windows media player visuals, pulsating along with purple ones. This is normal? I have been seeing this for years I think. This isn't migraine related.But I can see with my eyes open, when looking at tv or cellphone in dark room. it doesn't obscure central vision, but peripheral keep pulsating, sometimes it is annoying if I stand up this would Not happen.This thing doesn't happen in bright lightIt's more noticeable in dark room, sometimes when I go to sleep, or keep staring at cellphonee , but not all the timesometimes the green thing looks like a bright cloud upside my vision when looking at cellphone but after awhile It goes away as all thiis lightshowsorry for grammar"
Conjunctivitis,BLOODSHOT / VEINY EYES,"So for as long as I can remember I have suffered with red veiny eyes that are quite dry when I first wake up, but no irritation or burning or itching whatsoever throughout the day. They become slightly irritated when applying eye makeup. I thought it could be hayfever as ive noticed it more in the past few months so ive been on several different eye drops (not ones containing the thing that makes them whiter dont worry) and no eye drops work. I then take a daily antihistamine, again seems to make no difference at all. You can just constantly notice the swollen blood vessels and red eye but with no accompanied symptoms s for hayfever or any potential conditions im seeing online. attached immage below where you can see the inner and outer corner irritation. I thought it may be eye strain, if it is what can I do to get rid of the veins?"
Conjunctivitis,Optician appointment,Ive been to the optician today Bout the flashing in my eye. He was lovely and found a very small bleed at the back. He said the gel inside my eye is starting to come away and when it foes it pulls on the retina which causes the flashing. Hes 99% sure its not going to get any worse but hes going to write to the hospital to tell them what hes found and they will probably be in contact with me in the next few days to see if they want to laser the bleed or just leave it to do its own thing.Im really scared and upset.I saw what my dad went through with his retinal detachement and i cant do that. Im scared its going to get worse over time and im going to lose my sight and wont see my beautiful little girl as she grows older
Conjunctivitis,Seeing Blue Flashing Lights,"Hi! I am a 33 year old female. I keep seeing these bright blue specks of light that flash then disappear instantly. They almost look neon or LED. They are the size of little dots or pinpricks. It’s driving me crazy! They come and go super quickly, and are almost always in my peripheral vision.I had a baby in December and am still breastfeeding. I do suffer from migraines and had migraines with aura during my pregnancy but these aren’t similar and don’t seem related to my migraines. Most of the blue flashes happen in the dark or in dim light, but occasionally I’ll see them in a regularly lit room too.I went to the optometrist for an eye exam and she also did a scan of my retinas and said my eyes were dry, but otherwise healthy. She seemed to think the blue lights could be hormones from pregnancy/nursing. I just didn’t have these during pregnancy so I’m not sure if that’s it. I had an MRI in August while I was pregnant due to increased Migraine aura and it was clear.I work on the computer a lot for my job, and I’m on my phone a lot as well. I also got in the habit of using my phone in a dark room (rocking my daughter to sleep) which I know is horrible, I do have a blue light blocker screen protector, but I know it’s still bad for you.I am nearsighted and have a history of floaters, but I usually see them outside or in very bright light. These blue dots are completely different.Any ideas what this could be? I plan to see my doctor, but wondering if I should see a neurologist as well?"
Conjunctivitis,Eye scratch / corneal abrasion — how long for vision to stabilize?,"Four days ago, I suffered a corneal abrasion on my left eye. It hurt like hell for about 3 days, and now on the 4th day, it seems that the pain is totally gone. I've gone to the ophthalmologist, and he reckoned that it was nothing serious—a 2-3mm abrasion.However, it's now day 4 and the pain is gone but I'm seeing no real improvement in my vision. It's still quite damn blurry and makes reading harder when both of my eyes are open. I have, then, a few questions:I'd be grateful if anyone has experience with this!"
Conjunctivitis,Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) at 26?,Just wondering if anyone knows any more information or experience with Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD) for people under 30 years old?I have been suffering with severe and increasing floaters so got emergency eye test diagnosing PVD. Which should fingers crossed heal on its own and hope does not get any worse ?However I have a long list of health issues which may be causing my breaking down pretty quickly over the last couple of years. Anyone what health issues may cause this to happen at a younger age?Thanks!
Conjunctivitis,Right eye sees darker than left at night? Doctor wants an ERG?,"I'm new to this forum and need advice as soon as possible. I have generalized anxiety disorder and I'm a hypochondriac. I'm loosing my mind over hereFor a while now I've noticed that after I watch tv or look at my phone, my right eye begins to feel weird. I close my left eye and realize that my right eye sees a lot darker than my left, as if a curtain shade appeared in front of my eye. It goes away within 10-20 mins.I went to te eye doctor and he did all these eye exams and was even confused about my symptoms. He even dilated my eyes to look at my Retina. He said everything looked completely normal and I left without a diagnosis. I do wear glasses and my right eye is a bit worse than my left. I also have astigmatism. The doctor did say that this is either a symptom of my anxiety, or it could be retinitis pigmentosa. I didn't know what that was so I said oh okay. He referred me to an ophthalmologist who will perform an ERG. Being the hypochondriac that I am, I looked up the disease and immediately freaked out!! It's a genetic disease that could lead to me going blind?! And my symptoms fit! My anxiety has been crazy and I've had a panic attack ever since with the fear of me going possibly blind in a couple of years.My ERG is scheduled in two weeks, and it will be the two worst weeks of my life.Has anyone else had these symptoms? Does it have anything to do with seeing something bright like my tv or phone and then turning it off in complete darkness? It only happens with something that has a black light like those two. Other than that, if I walk in a dark room both of my eyes are fine.Also how does an ERG feel like and what's the process? Id like to read people's experiences and what they've been diagnosed withI hope I don't have that disease, no one in my family has that and I have a huge family. What are the chances I get the diseases out of everyone since its geneticThank you in advance for your replies "
Conjunctivitis,One line of red in my eye for at least 13 years (I'm 25),"So I had this line since I was at least 12. I'm not sure why and I can't get rid of it. I did a few experiements as well, for example I didn't look at a computer screen for 3-4 months (with very small exceptions) and it was still there. I'm curious to know what it is and how to get rid of it!imageAnother picture was taken for my social media and you can clearly see it on the right"
Conjunctivitis,PVD and Vision Changes,"Hi everyoneI had a PVD in my right eye 4 months ago which has now settled. The flashing has stopped and my vision is fine, thank goodness.Now my left eye seems different. It feels like I have a smudge on my glasses all the time.I don't have any flashes which is a relief, but wondering what could be happening?I was told to call the eye hospital if I had the same problem as before, but it's different.Many thanks."
Conjunctivitis,Rainbow halos around lights in one eye,I was diagnosed as being nearsighted and having an astigmatism. I also had a partial Posterior Vitreous Detachment but other then that every Ophthalmologist and Optometrist have said my eyes are healthy. I've seen rainbow halos around lights at night for quite sometime but I never attributed it to just one eye until recently.at my last eye exam my iop was a 17 which is a little high but other then that everything checked out.does anyone know if rainbow halos can be caused by astigmatism and nearsightedness or am I just being a hypochondriac?
Conjunctivitis,Diplopia after a fist hit,"Long story short, I got attacked Monday evening and guy hit me in the eye. Now I have a seemingly usual eye bruise, but one thing I am concerned about is subsequent diplopia, or double vision. I went to the ophthalmologist's and he said that it will most likely be gone when the bruise regenerates, but I'm still very concerned and really afraid of it not going away.Right now I'm writing this with my left eye open because it is uncomfortable for me due to vision overlapping.Will it go away itself or a surgery is required for that?"
Conjunctivitis,eye floaters causing serious anxiety,"Hi all,hope you all are doing well.I have myopia since I was in primary school and am -3.00 in both eyes, sometime during my early 20, i developed sudden flashed in my eyes which as you can imagine caused me to panic and I rushed to the eye doctors, they checked my eyes for tears and detachments but said there is nothing and my eyes seem perfectly healthy. Since that time the flashes have pretty much gone except when i'm going from a light room to dark or vice versa, but i guess this is just how my eyes adjust, anyway, this is not the problem. The issue is I have quite allot of floaters in my eyes, more in my left eye then right eye, there are times and in some lighting or days when i don't really notice them at all or much to bother me, but at other times such as when looking at a blue sky or against a light wall, particularly when i'm close to it, I see tons of flights, some light black and some cob-webish, and it causes me so much anxiety and panic that its the only thing I can think off, and I have to try calm myself down. So many times I have been to eye doctors and they check my eyes and say there is no sign of anything and the floaters are just as are.I don't know, i'm just scared if they continue to get worse, i'm only 25 and already. I know other people have floaters which are probably worse and more distressing then mine but I dont know, does anyone have any advice on this.thanks all, thats for taking the time to read"
Conjunctivitis,Flashes is peripheral view in both eyes,"Hello, does anyone had flashes in both eyes? I get them in the corner of my eyes when I am in a dark room or close my eyes... sometimes the left or right.... I also have tons of floaters. I got my eyes checked by a retina specialist in december for flashes in central vision and floaters and everything was ok. The central flashes are not there any longer but now I have the ones in peripheral vision.... I am so scared. anyone with this? Thanks so much"
Conjunctivitis,3D Effect,"I have been noticing this effect since last week , never noticed this before with older glassesI think my glasses are making text appear weird on screen, as if it had depth.On white background the black text looks layered , text looks convex ""bulging"" , i have an impression that even with my naked eye im seeing this effect, but very subtle.I have been wearing these glasses for two years, I am mildly myopic. I have been searching for this subject, but all I get on search engine is about ""new glasses, need to get using to"" but tthese glasses i have been got used for years, whats is this? My prescription changed?Even with pictures this happensIf I go to youtube right now, the sidebar video pictures looks like it has depthThe computer screen sometimes looks like it is made of paper...Whats is this? My prescription changed? Astigmatism changed?Does eyeglasses refraction gets bad after years?Or is it my brain? I'm just waiting for a new appointment and new glasses, but I want these questions answered"
Conjunctivitis,"Shimmering light after laser, how do I cope? ","Hello everyone. In need of a support group. Some people have good coping skills, however I do not. And I really need to talk to people who can relate right now.Almost 5 weeks ago I had laser barrage on the bottom of my retina (4-6 o'clock position.) I was told my lattice area was very thin and there was fluid pulling on the holes and it was best to laser it down. I was having an increase in dark floaters which is what brought me in. I was referred to a retina specialist and he wanted to do laser that day. I wish I would have thought about it more. I did feel like I was in danger at the time and that it wasn't optional to not do it. I was crying and shaking and I felt if it was optional they would have told me since I was so upset. I asked if this would affect my vision and he said no. I asked him so many questions and it was as if there could be no complications. He had me sign a waiver for macular degeneration and I knew I wouldn't be at risk since the macula was no where near where I needed laser.The first 3 weeks I was so fixated on the fact my pupil was still dilated. I was so upset by it, but now I feel it's the least of my worries. I feel my pupil is getting better but it's still not 100% back to normal. I see small strides with my pupil, but the blurry up close vision is almost back to normal. It seems like my pupil is working over time to try and go back to its normal size and position and I have faith it will make it there since I continue to see improvement. Then the 3rd-5th week I was getting flashing lights and shimmering in my peripheral vision. The shimmering is getting noticeably worse over time. The more light I am around through out the day, the more it acts up and comes into my vision. I notice it mostly when I look down on my phone, book, or just look down in general. I've gone back 5 times since the laser on emergency visits and I am told everything is fine and sent home every single time. I don't believe at this point I am in any danger with my retina. But the side effects are destroying me. I'm finally going for a second opinion this week. I just fear so badly that this flickering shimmering light is never going to subside. And it keeps getting worse. I can't believe this wasn't explained to me, and I have been reading about so many others going through the same thing. This just feels so wrong to me. I feel completely failed by the healthcare system. I'm questing everything right now. I just want to know or to have someone see this post who has gone through what I'm going through and to tell me it will get better. Yoga is the only thing getting me through this difficult time and even then it's hard to remain positive.Any coping skills would be greatly appreciated. And I really hope someone will tell me their situation has improved or give me some sort of hope. I really hope this isn't permanent. "
Conjunctivitis,Dry eyes and eyelid sticks to cornea while sleeping,"Been dealing with an eye issue over a year and wanted to share some tips to help anyone else dealing with this problem. Upon waking my right eye was hurting as I opened it and felt scraped. Doctor said dry eye but artificial drops alone did not help. I was actually afraid to go to sleep at night for fear of the eye lid sticking to my cornea. After a trip to an Opthalmologist it was suggested to use artificial tears during day and at night I use a thick ointment called Muro 128 by Bausch & Lomb. The ointment coats the eye and acts as a cushion between the lid and cornea. You will not be able to read once ointment in the eye so plan to sleep after you put it in. This really helped me because I felt more comfortable upon waking up that the eye would not stick to the lid do to being so dry. I also put artificial tears in the eye during the night if needed. I try to insert tears without opening eye too much to prevent any lid sticking to the eye. This is a nightly routine and it helped my ""dry eye"" problem since the cornea needed to heal per the eye doctor. I hope this helps someone. Even if you complain of just dry eyes you can use Genteal tears during the day.and the preservative free vials can be used as often as needed. In the morning to get rid of the Muro ointment I simply wipe my eyelids off with a makeup remover cleansing towelette."
Conjunctivitis,Do we need to see a doctor every time we suspect something gets into our eyes?,"If the amount of the chemicals aren't significant while at the same time you don't feel immediate pain or symptoms, doyou need to seek medical advice immediately?A few days ago I suspected some liquid chemicals ran into my eyes but the amount was very insignificant, I waseven not quite sure if something really got into my eyes, probably overreacting. An hour or two later I let distilledwater run through my eye for a few minutes, I didn't feel any pain or irritation. Was that OK?From time to time, not always, in home or public area unknown liquid or contaminated water in small amount couldget into our eyes, do we always need to seek medical help immediately if we think the amount is small and we don't feelany symptoms?Could our eye or its tissue gets hurt or damaged without feeling any symptoms beforehand?"
Conjunctivitis,Eye Pain 8 months after lens replacement surgery,"Hi. I had both eyes operated on about 8 months ago, multi focal lens replacement, from the very beginning my right eye took longer to recover than my left, and i have constant pain in the eye, it is as though the eye is under constant strain, worse when reading ( the whole point).. The doctor keeps giving me eye drops and saying vision is 20/20, but the pressure is getting worse, anyone had the same, any ideas, i really cant put up with this any longer, its as though its going to pop.... Thx"
Conjunctivitis,Anxiety as this pandemic can’t let me go to my regular retina examination. Shimmering more obvious.,"hi everyone, glad to have found this discussion as it is one of those times that I notice shimmering on my peripheral vision, left eye. hoping its just the anxiety of this pandemic that causes me to feel/see things more than usual.Sharing my experience to help and hopefully get answers too.I had vitrectomy, scleral buckle ,laser and IOL transplant done on both eyes, my left eye about 3 years ago and right eye 4 years ago.Current situation:Left eye- some blind spots and wavy line. hazy peripheral vision. There are time like now that i see shimmering on my peripheral vision.Right Eye- macula got detached 5 years ago and I didn't have it operated on for a month. tunnel vision with a huge blind spot in the middle. there is this constant ceiling fan effect that I can see 24/7 but I guess my brain has gotten used to it.I had these side-effects since right after my procedures and my doctor always says it is stable so I am thinking what we are all experiencing are the collateral damage to save a significant amount of our vision. they are always there but our brain gets used to it. There are times that make me worry, like bow that I could see the shimmering in my left eye more often.Usually what I do to make sure that its not a new tear is I go in for an eye examination but unfortunately, I am bot able to do that due to this pandemic, which makes me anxious and worried.Hopefully you guys could share your own experiences and let me know if there is anything I could do to know if this is a new tear or just one of the usual shimmers I see due to the trauma my eyes took from the procedures.Thank you everyone."
Conjunctivitis,Pain in feet and shines when walking,"I am 63 years old and think i am quite fit for my age. I started walking about 4 to five miles a day for about 2 weeks and have been fine.One day last week i felt i could do it as my feet and shines became painful, so had a weeks rest. Tried to start again but my legs feel weak and painful . I have bunions but cope with thus pain. Just cant seem to walk like i used to,Any help or advice would be grateful."
Conjunctivitis,Flashes that only happen this way ,"been six years since I noticed thisEvery time I leave a dark area and go out to see the natural light and return to the dark area I see flashes in my Vision , the flashes is faint blue and starts to make a ""bubbling"" pulsing ""boiling effect"" then stops and fades away, this isn't noticeable if the lights are on, but if I enter a dim area I can see the flashes or If I close my eyes . This does not obscure my vision,but I wonder if someone experience the same.This only happens this way, for example : you spend time inside house then go to backyard at daylight then return inside, close your eyes you start to see thse blue flashes pulsating the fades away in like 5 seconds.but sometimes I have seem this at night but much less flashes.Is this a normal reaction to light ?"
Conjunctivitis,Increase in flashes of light after laser treatment for retinal hole,Got laser done in both eyes because one side had a hole in it and the other side was thinning. After a decrease of flashes in the first week (for me its like flickers/sparkles of light) I feel like now (second-third week) I'm still seeing the same amount of flashes as I used to before and there has even been an increase in flashes and now I'm also seeing this weird static electricity /shimmer of light that I didn't see before. I didn't exercise or do anything active in the last two weeks except a few light household tasks and walking (slowly) around the house. I've also noticed that it gets worse when I walk around the house though I walk very slow so not sure if thats connected to it. Should I be worried? I've read in some cases its normal to see flashes after laser treatment for a retinal hole.
Conjunctivitis,Rapidly flickering lights in vision?,"Hi there,I'm a 25 year old male, and recently started to worry about this thing i've been having.So it doesn't seem to be triggered by anything in particular, but occasionally I get these extremely rapid flickers of light (an area occupying roughly 1/5 of my field of vision), lasting a short period of time (1-10 seconds). This tends to happen when i'm in bed, and would happen fairly frequently when I was meditating. The bizzare thing is that I seem to be able to interrupt them by blinking hard, or rubbing my eye. The frequency of these episodes also seems to vary, for example there was a period some months ago where this happened every night, and this morning it happened for the first time in months. They can also happen in either eye. Anyone else experience something similar?Thank you for taking the time to read this."
Conjunctivitis,What is this lump in my eye? ,I noticed this lump in my eye and its painful for a week and a half. I also keep getting blurry vision at times.
Conjunctivitis,"My eyes flicker when in light, and they may be flickering occasionally/also seeing shadows?","Hello! I'm Bella, fifteen years old and with no other health issues aside from my eyes. I have a lazy eye (my right eye I believe) but I can control it, and I'm also short-sighted (been wearing glasses for five years).However, recently, I feel like I've been having problems with my vision and I fear it could become a lot worse if I do don't something.Firstly, what I'm about to talk about here has been going on for about two years now, but since I couldn't find anything online about it and it didn't seem dangerous I brushed it to the side. Basically, whenever I enter a room which has a semi-bright light on, my eyes start to flicker between normal vision and seeing everything a little darker for a split second or so. It's weird since it doesn't go pitch black, only dimmer like someone has put a filter over it. This'll happen until I turn off the lights and my vision goes back to normal.Secondly, what I'm going to talk about in this paragraph has only been going on for a few days. I feel like my eyes are occasionally going black for a split second but I'm not sure if I'm just overreacting. Like, I don't know whether my eyes are actually flickering or if it's just birds passing by my window and obscuring the light for a split second haha. Another thing is sometimes I think I'm seeing shadows appear but then I'll look over and it's just something on my screen that's in the corner of my eye or my actual shadow moving about in the corner of my eye so I really can't be sure. I haven't been seeing any floaters (At least that's what I think they're called? Those weird patterns that happen when you close your eyes but instead they're actually in your vision or something) or anything else.I know my first 'symptom' is actually happening, but for the second ones, I'm not sure if they're actually real or if I'm just being paranoid over going blind or something. I spend a lot more time than average on my phone but it hasn't effected my eyesight. I'm absolutely terrified of going blind so I guess I just wanted to make sure nothing was going on. Thank you for reading ?EDIT: I forgot to mention that I have eye tests every 6 months to a year and they've never brought up anything about my eyes but I'm still worried. My last checkup was in February when none of my more recent symptoms had started."
Conjunctivitis,"Redness in one eye for over 2 months, clear bubbles in the white","Hello, I've been very depressed over my incurable, recurring eye problem. I did the mistake of putting on a dry contact lense to my already dry and weak eye, which was weak to the sunlight. a week after this, after crying I notice the redness which clears up in an hour did not clear up in one eye and it had a clear bubble which had formed on the side of my iris. Ive seen 2 doctors, first one said its an infection and gave me some pills which got rid of the bubble but not the redness. The other doctor told me it could be conjunctivitis due to allergy or ptyergium . He prescribed me anti allergic eye drops and redness clearing srops saying theres either a damage in my eye or im having an allergy due to somehing and he said ill suffer from it all my life. this makes me incredibly sad. idk whats causing my allergy i live in a clear environment. my right eye is itchy and irritated, often has yellow crusts, or wet yellow stuff in it while the other one doesnt. each time i cry it gets worse and more bubbles appear now my eye looks patchy and not clear. the redness gets worse in the evening. it gets better in the morning but the bubbles still exist. i need help because im concerned cosmetically and this has been going on for more than a month"
Conjunctivitis, Pvd (posterior vitreous detachment),"Interested in hearing peoples symptoms and experiances with this. I had pvd of the left eye and sure enough 6 months later,right eye. Having problems dealing with it. When both eyes are affected,hard not to think of it 24/7. Would like to hear others stories. Thanks."
Conjunctivitis,did weldiing kill my eyes,"im in a welding class in school and theres a welder just about every wear you look around the shop a lot of them not protected very well at all so I have inevitably been hit with other peoples welds when going to grab a pair of mig pliers or just looking for a open welder.(my class is large so its often hard to find one)Many were out of the corner of my eye and from a fair distance and once right in my eye when I turned around after putting on a a pair of gloves and someone un expectedly struck an arc I have also flashed my self a few times due to being new to welding 4 to be exact. I never got flash burn, though I am worried about my retina being damaged. I also used a cutting torch a few times with no shade protection. I also used a low amp plasma cutter one time for 3-4 minuets to cut thin metal with no protection as again I wasn't aware it was important(till I looked stuff up later that day) and no one else in the class ever used one.Now I have some vision things that im not sure are from my astigmatism getting worse, damage, or if there normal and I just never noticed it before. here they are1.One thing is that I look at bright text on a dark back ground on a computer it has a tint bit of a glow around it, for example white text on black background, dark blue, ect, and if a look at it farther away I see a copy of the text below the original.2.another is if I look at something white on a screen.(phone, computer, ect) it doesn't look completely white it looks like it has some slightly darker spots same both eyes3.I did one of those amsler grid tests and some of the squares looked like a light grey color and not white in both eyes.4.things that emit light seem to streak more than I remember, they streak more especially when I go to blink or look at them at an angle and not straight on.5. I get after images from reading text on my phone and I see different colored diagonal lines after images in my vision when I look at a computer or TV.I went to one optometrist and he looked at my eye for a fairly short amount of time said I would be ok and sent me on my way. I'm going to another next week as I'm not convinced I'm ok. I'm freaking out cause I'm a huge gamer and I love my dog and if I ever have kids I want to be able to see them well. I don't think I could keep on living with bad vision id rather die. what do you guys think, did I just mess up my vision or not?Update: the darker spots on my computer are due to a dirty monitor"
Conjunctivitis,Eye pain/strain only when looking at screens?,"I'm 19 and have been very active on computers and other screens for many years and never had any problems. I have glasses for 10 years with no problems. I got my prescription updated over a year ago and had no problems, as usual, until about 5 months ago. One night while on the computer I started to feel a little strain like the screen was a little too bright. That had happened in the past very rarely so I didn't think much about it. The next day it got worse and I started having eye pain after about ten minutes of looking at my monitor (keeps in mind I've looked at monitors for hours before with no problems like this). For two weeks, I couldn't stand to look at ANY screens. TV, computer, phone, etc. I had to use my phone and PC occasionally but could only tolerate it when the brightness on these devices was completely turned down. The pain was like having really dry eyes but when I looked at a screen, I could feel a pain shooting through my eyes (mostly my right eye but still in both.) After two weeks, it got a little better and I could look at screens some, but the brightness has to stay low and it still hurts some more days than others. It's been 5 months and it won't go away. I've been using drops for severe dry eyes and it seems to have helped a little but not much.NOTE: I went to my eye doctor a few days ago. He checked my prescription, focusing range, and looked into my eyes (but he didn't dilate them). He basically said my eyes were perfectly fine and told me to take breaks every once in a while when using a computer and pushed me out the door (in a manner of speaking). I've been taking huge breaks and limited my use to 1-2 hours a day and still I have the same pain.What should I do? I start college for a tech degree this fall and it hurts to look at screens. I'm in a deep depression now because I can't find relief and I need to know how to fix this. I know there's something wrong with me, I just don't know what. Should I get a second opinion? I've read that if your eyes are really dry or something, you could have a tear or do some kind of damage and need to put antibiotic ointment on your eyelids to help repair them. I don't know if that's true but I friend described my problem to his eye doctor out of state and that's what he said. And I've read it in a few places online. It would mean the world to me if anybody would lend their advice. I'm so close to just giving up and hope I can be happy in another career & routine that doesn't involve as many screens but it's making me miserable."
Conjunctivitis,Tiny white spot in the dead-center of my vision making it hard to read.,"Does any one know what eye problem generates a very small, white, cloude-like spot in the dead-center of your vision that makes reading hard? I thought it was a cataract, but I just had cataract surgery and that did nothing to remove it.Over two and a half months I went from being close to 20/20 vision to 20/200. Cataract surgery got me down to 20/80. I think this cloud, and silicone oil from a retina detachment, are the only things keeping me from getting back to 20/20.When ever vision got worse, I would fill the silicone oil in the eye when I got up in the morning, and when I stopped taking my prescribed eye drops, vision stopped getting worse. I'm just trying to put a name to it to give my retina specialist. Cataract/inflammation were the only things they came up with before surgery.I Google imaged 149 eye problems, but didn't find any with images of vision looking the way I see it."
Conjunctivitis,Regarding Certain Eye Issues,"Hi all,My name is Neel. I am 25 years old and I suffer from certain eye issues which are affecting my everyday life. Last year inFebruary 2018, I started having panic attacks. These attacks lasted four months up until June 2018, during and after whichthese eye symptoms started.The following is what I am feeling right now (although I could describe what I have felt before, the list would be too big soI am keeping it short):Left eye is evaporative dry and both eyes have blepharitis as told by the Ophthalmologist I saw earlier: I believe dry eyeis due to windy weather where I was living when I was having panic attacks, as well as due to panic attacks?I do not feel anything in my left eye (i.e. when I go to sleep, left eye does not feel tired as the right one, when I wakeup it feels as such it did not go to sleep at all, same effect throughout the day where I just do not feel my left eye): thisis quite possibly due to another experience I had back this year in March 2019 where I got rid of the swelling of inferiorturbinates using a home remedy and I started feeling the symptoms of Empty Nose Syndrome (ENS). This experience had a big impact on my left eye as the swelling only got reduced from my left nose and it happened over night. Does this have to do anything with the dry eye?Sometimes if I get anxiety attack or panic attack, left eye shrinks and I start getting pain in the back of my head of theleft eye. Although, this now happens rarely. Ophthalmologists I have seen have not been able to tell the actualreason apart from putting it on my anxiety.When I get bad sleep, I just don't feel my left eye throughout the day.Left eyeball feels harder than the right eye: even though eye tests have shown normal IOP for both eyes.Confused with my eye vision after panic attacks as I am marking a lot of things about myself: even though I had many eyetests and have met both ophthalmologist and neuro-ophthalmologist: possible one of the reasons being masturbations from the age of 12? Although now I have stopped this habit.Last week during heatwave, my left eyeball turned red and only after using the eye drops, it got back to normal. However,I feel that after this experience, my left eye has become more numb than before. Should I be worried about this? And what can I do about this apart from putting eye drops?One of the things I constantly notice is that the left eye is slightly yellower than the right: I still have not figuredout the reason behind this. However, I believe after I started using eye drops, the yellowishness has reduced.Here are the further possible causes of my above eye issues:I used to wear tight glasses which caused a dent from head temples which I believe caused my left eye to grew smaller asmy left side face grew smaller over the years (my right side of face is much bigger than the left)?: Ophthalmologist testshowed that palpebral fissure measurement of right eye is 11 mm, whereas, for left eye it is 9.5 mm. What I am confused about is how can tight glasses cause this effect? If not tight glasses, then what could be the reason for this difference. I doremember once rubbing my eyes when I was 16 years old which I believe had a strange impact on my left eye. Could rubbingcause squint and subsequently affecting the growth of the eyes over the years?Due to Weight loss (I have lost 10-12 kgs in the course of 16 months since I started having panic attacks)? It is nowdifficult to gain weight after March 2019 experience where after again I started losing weight. Does weight loss have animpact on the eyes?Due to Lack of blood circulation to brain because of severe panic attacks?Due to Vitamin Deficiency?: Although blood tests don't show any.Due to Viral infection?: I used to get a lot of cold and fever when I was a child.Due to Weak nerves?: Same reason as 5.Due to Head injury or Brain trauma?: Panic attack is kind of a brain trauma I believe.I have swollen inferior turbinates and they also possibly affect my eyes?Due to low immune system and hemoglobin levels? Same reason as 5.Even though the Ophthalmologist did carry out different kinds of test including looking at the health of the eye from theback (optic nerve), it seems that there is more than dry eye and blepharitis, quiet possible due to panic attacks I had lastyear. After the panic attacks, the blood test showed lack of VB12 for which I have got injections and the levels are nownormal.My questions are:Whom should I consult now, if required?Panic attacks impact have put me in a position where wearing any kind of prescription glasses make me anxious which iskeep forcing me to think about wearing contact lenses. As a result, is it a good idea to wear contact lenses when I have dryeye and blepharitis and other eye symptoms described above?What is the association between eye and nose?Any other solutions and suggestions.Things I am doing on a regular basis to cure some of the above issues:I do understand it is quite a long post, so accept my apologies for it, however I do need assistance in understanding what ispossibly wrong with my left eye and what else I can do about it.Thank you in advance,Neel."
Conjunctivitis,Aesthetic appaearance after scleral buckle surgery,"Hi all I'm new here and had scleral buckle surgery for a retinal detachment 5 weeks ago now. I'm 20 and had a long standing retinal detachment in my eye for 2 years before it required surgery as it was getting worse. The operation was a success which I was relieved to hear and vision wise I am just suffering from a bit of double vision which I have been told is normal and should ease off over time. However my main problem is with the appearance of the eye following this procedure. I went back to the hospital today as the bottom outer corner of my eye, where the buckle was fitted, has turned into a massive lump that is a greeny colour in appearance. Surrounding it is still very red and my eye is still not fully open. The doctor reassured me that this was normal, saying that the redness was due to a haematoma which would go down in time. This was a relief as I thought I had an infection. However the huge lump which is causing my bottom eyelid to bulge out and not be open properly, I was told, would remain that way. He said that the buckle was still visible but would become less visible as the white grows around it..however he said the lump would stay! This has truly upset me as my eye is a completely different shape from the other and will remain like that as long as the lump is there. The doctor I saw was not a retinal specialist however he did ring a colleague who confirmed that this was not concerning. I am awaiting my 8 week check up where I will ask how much I can expect the lump to go down. But in the mean time im freaking out that my eye will never look normal again and am on here looking for others who can give me their own experiences of how their eye looked once it was fully healed. I would really appreciate this so I can get peace of mind/prepare for the permanent changes to my eye. Thanks in advance Abi "
Conjunctivitis,Floaters after eye exam with pupil dilation,"Hi, I am a 60 year old male who typically wear glasses. Never really had any issues with my eyes. About three weeks ago I lost my regular prescription glasses, not a big deal.... has happened before. A few days later, after attempts to find them were unsuccessful, I went to the optometrist to get a new prescription. Had my vision checked and my pupils dilated. A day (or two) later, a black spot developed in my right eye. I did not know what it was and visited a few days later an ophthalmologist. After a thorough series of tests, which of course included dilation again, I was told that I developed a ""floater"". The next day the second floater showed up and over the last week or so, several other floaters have developed in my right eye which significantly interferes with what and how I see things through that eye. Very unpleasant. I will see a retinal specialist next week to discuss how and where to go from here....... I am a scientist and do not believe in coincidences. The fact that the first floater appeared right after pupil dilation makes me believe that there is a connection. I found one other post in a different forum from someone that had the same experience and am interested to find out whether there is any further indication that in fact dilation can lead to the formation of floaters.... I do know one thing.... having floaters is undoubtedly changing my life."
Conjunctivitis,"Split second loss of vision, like a quick blink.","Hello, as in the title, I was reaching up earlier to pull a tack out of the ceiling, and I experienced a very quick loss of vision, like a very fast blink, I can only describe it as a light flickering during a storm.I don't get migraines, I had an eye test about 3 months ago and there were no problems, I'm a bit short sighted but that's about it.I've never had it before, I don't really get any problems such as overactive floaters. I do sometimes see a tiny speck of blue light, but that's not often, and slight flashes now and again were mention to the optician.I'm wondering if it's something I need to revisit the optician about? I also suffer from anxiety so this is something I will probably worry about."
Conjunctivitis,New floater suddenly appeared,I hope everyone is well! I have had a floater in my right eye for years and have got used to it being there. suddenly yesterday one appeared in my left eye. Obviously at this terrible time of Covid 19 I do not want to have to go hospital and my opticians have closed. I can still see well out of the eye apart from this silly blob flying around! Last night I put in some drops for dry eye and for a short while had some very small flashes at the left side of the eye but have not had that today. I am very scared as I have not been out for three weeks as I am 74 and self isolating.Any advice would be appreciated. I am hoping to wait at least until Tuesday to follow up if it gets worse.

Conjunctivitis,Feels like something in my eye,"Yesterday I was scraping moss and dirt off some bricks to cement them and it became windy, I think it may have entered my eye.Since yesterday it still feels like something in my right eye, I tried looking in the mirror, can't see anything, the sides are slightly red and my eye feels irritated tired and a little itchy on the edges, close to the nose.I tried crying, blinking and putting my head under water, it doesn't work.I rub tissue on my eyelid, and that feels sore, but can't see any dirt or debri even on the eyeball.I tried rinsing water from a bowl, but afraid of damaging my eye.Would it damage the eye rinsing water on it? It does feel stingy.The feeling goes away a bit sometimes, like I went for a short walk today and was ok, it was quite breezy which made my eye watery, but when I went to the house, I feel it more.Would nasal irrigation do something even if it won't cleanse the eye?I have some eye drops for tired and dry eyes, I'm wondering if this would be any use for this?"

Conjunctivitis,Complications after retinal surgery. What is it?! Anyone have similar symptoms? ,"Hello. I'm not very good in English, sorry. I'm man 20 years old, and have high myopia(around - 15 dptr). In October 2019 i get regmatogenic retinal detachment on right eye and have scleral buckling (segmental ) and laser coagulation. I use drops : ""Vigadexa"" 10 days 4/day ;and ""Nevanac"" 30 days 3/day.I have a good recovery, but maybe was high intraocular pressure, because sometimes i feel some discomfort(specially after eyes movement).At 20th day after surgery i lifted about 1,5 kg/hand and move with this about 5 minutes. After this i feel, that my pain after eyes movement are less, then early.At the evening of this day i see new vitreous destruction, how on picture(1), and other symptoms:If someone have something like this, tell me how you got it and what it is, in your opinion.I personally think it connected with intraocular pressure and anatomical structure of retina, maybe changes axial length of eye under influence pressure (besides vitreous destruction)."
Conjunctivitis,Visual Anomoly (bright spot/ persistent afterimage in eye),"Hi all,I’ve been experiencing a very weird visual anomaly since 2 months ago. I noticed it after i had neck surgery as it appeared in my visual field right after so i’m not sure if they are related. Anyways, i have this weird small circle-oval shaped bright spot in my vision. I don’t see it when my eyes are opened nor do i see it when my eyes are closed. I only see it when i blink and as i blink it appears to be a bright spot, sort of like what you see which would be a after-image. It is not noticeable against dark backgrounds or when i’m outside and my eyes are distracted by other visual stimuli but it’s very noticeable if i look at a white wall or a very bright white computer or phone screen. It’s in my left eye and it appears towards the peripheral side whenever i blink.I went to the optometrist for it very recently and she said she could not find anything wrong with my eyes as my retina, macula and the rest else is perfectly healthy. I did a pupil dialation test and had retinal images taken on both eyes. She did however notice that my retina in my left eye (where the visual anomaly is occurring) has a thinner retina than my right, but she said she isn’t concerned as it’s normal among nearsighted individuals and said although thinner, the retina has no tears or holes.I’m 22 years old, very healthy and haven’t had any issues with my eyes other than the common myopia (near-sightedness) and in the past experienced only 2 migraines with a visual aura.Could this be a cotton wool spot? a Weiss floater? I really don’t know and would really appreciate advice!"
Conjunctivitis,Small black spot in Vision,"Hi everyone,i am new here."
Conjunctivitis,Still seeing flashers after Scleral buckle surgery and which eye am I seeing flashers in?,"Hi all-I am 23 years old and i was born with lattice degeneration so i have retinal thinning in both eyes, but only my left experienced a tear, while the other i had lasered to hopefully prevent tears from occurring. i received scleral buckle surgery about a month ago for the tear in my left eye. Around two weeks post-op i began noticing more flashers than i did before the operation and i was told that if i saw more flashers, i should call my doctor and have them look at it. i met with my doctor who only looked at the eye that was operated on and he said everything looked fine, but the flashers appear all the time still (making it hard to know if they're ""increasing"") and sometimes i notice squiggly lines (almost like fluid ) moving in the top right corner of my left eye (up near the top of my nose). i know the doctor said my left eye looked fine, but the fluid seems odd and this is now leading me to think the flashers are in my other eye. Has anyone else had flashers or a fluid-like area in their eye after scleral buckle surgery? And how can i tell which eye the flashers are in?Thanks!"
Conjunctivitis,Eye flashes long after Vitrectomy,"Dear community,I really would like to hear your opinion about my case.So, i was born with a very heavy short-sight. So heavy that i got a retina detachment on both eyes with 11 monts of age. So i got a vitrectomy on both eyes. Phew.I got MANY more surgerys after that. I got basically everything until now. But only once did the retina had to be fixed. However - it was heavily damaged in both eyes - i dont have a lot of sight left. (~20%) After the surgery i saw a lot of flashes bursting through the eyes. After years it became less and less. Now - after 19 years they are still there. They appear only sometimes and i dont really see why. When i move the eyes rapidly they actually do not appear which seems interresting. But after 19 years? Is that even possible? I have seen a lot of articles in the internet that state the flashes dissapear after 1-6 monts.Could it be, because my retina is so heavily damaged? (When i got the surgery, it was almost completely detached, so it is actually insane that i can still see so much)Here some info:*Last retina-based surgery: 19 years ago*Flashes seem to appear randomly (~0-5 times a day)*There were no surgerys or problems in general since 7 years*The doctor checks every 6 monts and didnt find anything odd since this time.*I have to take eyedrops because of a little bit too high eye pressure*At this time there are NO odds different from the last 7 years. I just want to ask because i'm worried.And one more thing. On my retina there are LOTS of lasered spots everywhere, to connect it.Can these spots get loose? Can it happen ever again on spots that were lasered? After all it is almost 20 years.I know its a lot of text. Really hope you can give me your opinion or if you can tell me professional answers to my questions.Greetings!"
Conjunctivitis,Does this look like conjunctivitis? please help. thank you,
Conjunctivitis,Ciliary nerve damage,"If the long and short ciliary nerves inside the eye were damaged through trauma or for other reasons, could the damaged nerves have an effect on the pigments in the iris resulting in a change in eye (iris) color? All so if blood vessels and arteries were damaged inside the eye could it have an effect on the color of the iris?"
Conjunctivitis,Ghost imaging,i’ve had ghost imaging since 2015 it never was bad just with lights ive had my eyes checked 2 times this past year and they said my eyes look perfect but recently the ghosting has got worse its with everything now like everything on tv and stuff ive noticed during the day outside i dont really have it but when the sun sets or a dim place inside i see it more anyone had to go through this could i just need new glasses?
Conjunctivitis,‘Palpable Orbital Mass’ plus ‘ Suspicious RNFL thinning nasally on OCT’,"Hi all,Feel like this is going to be the longest two weeks ever.I was referred to hospital by my optician. My left eyelid has been sagging and there's a lump behind it. I saw the Opthamologist at the hospital who gave drops, turned my eyelids inside out etc.She said it is a firm palpable orbital mass that stems back into my eye socket. It's not attached to the eyelids or glands in my eye. She got another doctor to write the notes whilst she was examining me. She said she could 'palpate 11mm diameter'. It does feel like quite a big lump but thats probably because space is tight in that area anyway. She also said it's pressing on my eyeball.In addition, I have just seen a letter sent to my GP which says they saw 'suspicious RNFL thinning nasally on OCT but symmetrical'.My visual field test is recorded as 'temporal reduced field- left eye only'. It says 'suspected orbital lesion'.I have two 'urgent' CT scans booked: head and orbits with contrast.I have to repeat these tests again at the eye hospital in 4 days. The letter says 'if any signs of progression to expedite management'.I also have tingling & numbness in my left cheek.Does anyone else have any experience of situations like this? I'm 36 with two young children so naturally worried. I lost my Mum when I was young (she had brain tumours); my mind is probably putting 2 + 2 together and making 10!! Thanks guys ?"

Conjunctivitis,"I've been experiencing eye tiredness randomly, what should I do?",Why are My eyes so very tired randomly and it long for 2 weeks after 8 hours straight working for one week even I'm wearing anti fatigue glasses and it is true that carrot can help because I'm not a fruit or vegetable lover. All I do is to massage my eye with ointment.
Conjunctivitis,I had red vision for some weeks a long time ago.,"Hello!I'm here to ask if anyone knows about any diseases or conditions that may include red vision. I had this issue multiple months ago, maybe even a year or more, but I no longer have this issue since it naturally got healed up after a couple of weeks. However, I still want to know if it is serious and if I need to be careful in the future. I have gotten 2 check ups but the doctors have not found much. The check ups were a series of scans of the inside of my eye, and that's about everything I understood and can recall.The issue started out with a black (very dark red) blob (in my left eye only) that looked like a dark floater/dot at first and grew bigger and bigger as time progressed. It looked like some kind of viscous fluid, maybe some form of coagulated blood was leaking into my eye but I am not sure. It spread or it mixed into the rest of my vision so to speak (side-note: it started out in the central zone of my vision). As the days went on I just had this very dark red overlay on my vision and a lot more floaters than usual, and of course I couldn't really see because of a very blurred vision. After a bit into the issue happening it made it so that i could almost not detect light. It looked like when you shine a light through some dark liquid like coke, or a dark tea.After a couple of weeks it healed up exactly before the check up I had booked, and after my vision cleared I had way less floaters that I had even before I had the issue. The way I know this is that the other eye which I had no issues with at all has way more floaters now compared to my left eye, but I might have perceived it wrong and something might be affecting both eyes which I'm not aware of.My vision worsened and I ended up needing glasses after the healing happened. After the healing I noticed peripheral vision that was miles better than what I had before and compared my right eye. Even today the vision in my left eye is clearer regarding floaters and better if you consider peripheral vision compared to my right eye, except that I am near-sighted on my left eye of course. I can also see way more in the dark with my left eye compared to my right eye.Most of what I called symptoms might be just random anomalies that I picked up on that don't have to do with the actual issue, but please do ask if you have any more questions."
Conjunctivitis,Tear duct cyst ( lacrymal cyst),"I have had swelling in my rt eye socket for about 7 months . After seeing 4 doctors, I was finally told I had a benign cyst and that it could be surgically removed. The swelling is not constant , and at times, not an issue. Has anyone dealt with this problem, and resolved it non-surgically? I read that organic castor oil can dissolve eye cysts, and have been trying this for past couple days. I am not keen on eye surgery, however minor!"
Conjunctivitis,Few different eye concerns,"my last visit to my ophthalmologist was back in July of 2019. He said I'd no longer be visiting him and my new visit would be with an Optometrist instead because my PVD was no longer a concern to him.I'm 32 years old, but I have a few questions for any of you who are well versed in eye function/health.Question one- If I look straight with my eyes and move my head left or right, I'll see pressure circles in my eye as if I was poking it with my finger just not as dark. Is this normal?Question 2 - my eyes seem to get red when I'm trying to fall asleep and the pressure circles are worse when I've been laying in the dark, then go to the bathroom and look at my eyes in the mirror. they're pretty bloodshot and when I move my head left to right while keeping my eyes straight the pressure circles seem more intense."

Conjunctivitis,Smudges even after laser surgery for retinal tear. Will I ever get a clear vision back?,"Hi,I just found out about this forum. I had been seeing smudges in my left eye for quite some time and when I visited the doctor he told me I need a laser surgery to fix a big retinal tear.I got the laser done 3 weeks back but I still see smudges and it seems that I have a thin film over the eye. I just want to know if anyone experienced these same symptoms even after the surgery and how long will it take to go back to a clear vision.These smudges seem to increase when I am concentrating on doing something."
Conjunctivitis,Optician referral to hospital. So worried,"HiI hope someone can help as I am going mad with worry. I went to see an optician last week (i've not seen one in years as not had trouble with my eyes that I knew of). Anyway, he exmained me and my vision in the left eye is perfect as well as the inside of the eye. The right eye is shortsighted. He examined my eyes with the bright light and then said I have to refer you to the hospital and gave me a letter for my GP about my shortsighted right eye....I walked out of there dazed and panicked... Basically the letter says 'urgent referral' - RE disc margins blurred 0.2. Otherwise both eyes appear healthy.What does this mean? I've done a lot of googling but all sorts of eye conditions keep coming up but I've not found anything as to say what this means? Does blurred disc margins mean inflammation of the optic disc? What could cause this?I gave the letter to my GP practice and they said the hospital will write to me. So it is a long wait now and I feel sick with worry that I can't eat. The optician asked me if I have frequent strong headaches. I have occassional and mild headaches. No loss of temporary vision in my RE and i have been shortsighted in this eye for at least 15 years. No nausea or vomitting and the pressure in both my eyes is normal. It's 13 and 15 in each eye.Please can someone tell me what could cause blurred disc margins in one eye? Is it inflammation of the optic nerve or could this mean something else? I know no one can tell me for sure what I have but I was hoping there are people who may have had the same or know what could cause blurred optic disc margins. Presumably 0.2 means the blurred margin of 0.2 mm. Is this significant?I am 42yo, not diabetic and have normal blood pressure, last reading about three weeks ago 114/78.Sorry for the long post and many thanks to anyone who repliesDiana"
Conjunctivitis,Pain in/around eye?,"So, I have posted a few times here before, as I have been seeing flashes and floaters in my vision for the last few months. Eye doctor was unable to determine the cause, and I am unsure if it related to what is happening now. My right eye hurts a lot, it feels like someone is squeezing the eyeball. While I initially thought it was just a sinus headache, and I guess it still could be, I have never had one like this, an ache specifically in and around the eye. My vision is completely fine aside from the floaters and such, and there is no redness or anything wrong on the outside of the eye so far.Anyone have any idea what this could be? Between this and recent Ulcerative Colitis diagnosis, the last few weeks have not been a fun time. Could really use some help or advice here. Have made an appointment with eye doc, but it's three weeks out. ?"
Conjunctivitis,Eye watering ,I have watering problem in my left eye since the past 8 years. Have gone through detailed checkup by various eye specialists and examined eye tear ducts as well. Doctors say that I have no sickness at all and prescribed me lubricants and anti allergic drops but to no avail. Recently I realized that my problem resolved when air relative humidity touches to 70 to 80%. Can someone help me to treat this illness. Thanks
Conjunctivitis,White flickering light after laser for retinal tear,"I posted on here a few weeks ago about a black/gray spot I kept seeing after the retinal tear laser surgery. I saw on the doctor's notes it was the photocoagulation. I also saw that I have lattice degeneration which I'm assuming contributed to the tear. I am not seeing the black spot so much anymore, unless I blink or change rooms with different lightings, but now in its place I am constantly seeing a flashing light that looks white especially in dim lighting. It extends to the side of my eye as well, which I'm assuming is from where the laser was also done. I went to the retinal specialist and said everything looked fine and this could be a side effect of the laser and it generally goes away within a couple months. I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced this with the laser and if it went away? this has been very disorienting for me and I have been fearing losing my peripheral vision. I'm not sure if I am actually losing peripheral vision or if it just feels that way since I have this constant flickering now on the side. I know it's better to be safe than sorry, but a part of me wishes I never did this laser bc its been causing so many issues for me and supposedly the tear had scar tissue from healing itself. If anyone has had any experience with this and would like to share I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you."
Conjunctivitis,Posterior vitreous detachment query,"Hello, I’m new to the site and I have a query. My PVD started about 2 weeks ago with flashes in my Peripheral vision. This was followed by a sense of more floaters. I went to my Eye A&E: a Doctor carried out a full exam. Good news is that there are no tears ‘tobacco powdering’ etc but could see the vitruous was starting to shift.Over the last week I’ve come to realise that the floaters aren’t so much new - they seem to have shifted position. I’ve had floaters for years and in particular - I’ve had what seems like a film or sheet of floaters consisting of lots of small light grey circles. This always ‘floated’ somewhere in the top right of my vision and rarely troubled me. This now seems to have shifted down in to my central vision which is now highly distracting especially in the sun.I wondered if anyone else has had a similar experience? I’m hoping that as the vitreous shrinks, the floater moves past central vision and settles.Also, I find that, sometimes, the flashes seem to happen in response to when I am focusing on reading.Any advice would be appreciated.Thanks"
Conjunctivitis,Lighting on eyes,"Hello everyoneI would like to share my experience, tonight I had a soccer game and at the end of it once I sit down to change clothes I gradually started feeling some issue on my eye/s.I felt like my right eye mainly ( maybe the left one not much ) started having some kind of waving in the peripheral vision mainly. Like, up and right wing and maybe a little middle if I had to locate it. Like flashes sort of thing.10yr ago I had something similar after training on my right eye, flashes.Its duration was like 5-10 minutes and then it stopped.One thing that I thought but I'm not sure is if it was caused by a ball that went to my head after a lob passHowever it wasn't that powerful, I didn't feel any pain or dizziness at all. That touch happened 10 minutes ago before that eye issue started. Also the soccer ball is soft. We have got many balls in our faces and way strong shots but we didn't have any issue. Do you think it has relation or not at all?Is it because if the game pressure and or fatigue factor you think? To add further detail, I have floaters already plus I have a lot of anxiety recently.Thank you very much in advance! Any opinion is greatly appreciated"
Conjunctivitis,Retinal Tear Laser Surgery ,"I recently went to a retinal specialist because I was getting some flashes now and then and a lot of floaters and she told me I had a retinal tear that actually had tried to repair itself but said she would do the laser retinal repair surgery to prevent it from opening. The doctor acted as though it was very low risk and I went a long because I feared any vision loss and I didn't think there were common complications. Since the laser a few days ago I have this blank black/gray spot in my lower peripheral. Sometimes I see it more than others like in certain lighting or if I'm moving my head a lot. Sometimes it even just looks like a little light. I told the doctor about it and she says she thinks it's from the inflammation from the laser and should resolve but there might be a chance that the spot will remain but I'll only see it if I try to look for it and most people don't notice it. I notice everything however and I am only 24 and have good peripheral vision so it's a big deal for me. I was wondering if anyone had this experience and saw the spot and over time it disappeared. I saw a post in another forum that someone had the cyro procedure, saw what sounded similar to what I was seeing and it eventually disapeared. Any comments on experiences with this retinal tear laser would be helpful. Thank you. "
Conjunctivitis,Foggy vision after a pvd ,Hi this is my second pvd...not as bad as before but still have a floater from 3yrs ago...I am now in the 9th week with the second..so still early days..just this time my vision is quite foggy...comes and goes has anyone else had this please...thanks chrissy
Conjunctivitis,Seeing ghost images (double vision) in both eyes,"I have been seeing ghost images in both eyes since around the end of august 2017. The best way to describe it is seeing faint extra images coming from the top and bottom of whatever i am looking at, which is something lighter than its surroundings( like a street light at night or subtitles in movie). Imagine the letter “A” with a white font, on a screen on a black background, I would see faint copies of this letter above and below it. This happens with anything that is bright in darker background ( a black letter A in a white background would be fine).These ghost images can move further vertically away from the original, depending on how hard i squint. When i turn my head sideways, it occurs horizontally instead.I have started using glasses since around october and I got them thinking it would make it go away, and it does while wearing them (not entirely sometimes), but i do not recall ever in my life having this problem before I got them. I am nearsighted and have been my whole life, but these double images are new and conisitent. Even with glasses, these ghost images are come out if i squint. I have been to several optometrists and they were completely useless. These optometrists confirmed that it isnt cataracts and astigmatism. I read that it MIGHT be some type of diplopia, but not entirely sure. I just want to know if anyone who wears glasses or not, has been experiencing the same thing and what they do to treat or diagnose it. Please help, this is ruining my quality of life. Glasses help me see and I should have got them a while ago. But this problem seems unrelated, does everyone who wears glasses have the same issue? "
Conjunctivitis,My vision can’t seem to focus,Ive recently noticed this a week ago and its been on and off. And is starting to worry me because it seems to be getting slightly worse. I cant seem to focus too well and I feel light headed as if im not mentally there only physically. my vision is blurred and sometimes sort of dizzy or as I said before out of focus. also this happens randomly and sometimes I feel normal then all of a sudden it happens. And I am 17 years old just note and ive been having some headaches and pains in my head for about 6 months. I went to get a CAT scan 3 to 4 months ago and all seemed normal. If someone could help that would be great because I dont know what to do.
Conjunctivitis,Eye mites and contact dermatitis or eczema ,"This has been going on way longer than it should have, but I have some patchy red spots around mainly my left eye. They tend to itch a lot and can get scaly on occasion. I have gone to my dermatologist who diagnosed it as eczema and gave me a steroid cream. I do not have this any other place other than near my eye. The first round seemed to work some, it lessened on my left eye, but then started appearing some on my right eye. Long story short, I went back a few more times, got different creams, and same-ish result. My sister had an eyelash mite infestation and it got me thinking I could have a similar issue. I went to my eye doctor and she said my eyelids were inflamed, but did not see any mites. She prescribed an antibiotic in case they had created an infection. After the first week of taking the medication, I noticed a huge improvement. At the end of the week, I started noticing some redness and itching again and was told to take another dose, this was last week. Over the weekend, under my eye seemed to truly regress and is back to itchy and super red.All that to ask, if I eventually kill the infection (assuming that's what it is), how long would be reasonable to assume the red, itchy, patchy skin will go away? Would I need to go back to the steroid cream? I have never had this type of issue before and seems super stubborn to get it to go away."
Conjunctivitis,Ongoing PVD but causing pain like toothache in my eyes,"HiI had a PVD back in August, thought by my optician to be a Macular hole (I had a yellow circle in my central vision, left eye). The eye hospital said it wasn't and said it's a PVD and will fade in a few months.Now, 5 months later, I had another massive lightning flashes and black floaters resembling a swarm of mosquitoes and large tadpoles swimming all over my vision!It mostly faded in a few days but I was left with a grey translucent curtain that sweeps from left to right when I blink. I went to opticians who said it was all fine and just another PVD. I asked if you get pain with that and they (like the hospital) said def not as there are no nerves in there to cause pain.The had to re-do my eye pressure puff of air test 4 times as they didn't seem to be getting results. I feel the 4th time was no different to the others and they just said we'll leave it at that it's fine.However, the flashes have mostly gone. I have been left with a vertical line of flashing right in the outside corner of the eye and I see them if I look left to right (eg when driving and checking mirrors). I also still have the grey curtain.But what is really bothering me is the pain. I have intermittent pain like a sudden bad ache just above and behind my eye. It lasts maybe 10-20 seconds they completely disappears, and strangely, it has started in my right eye or a less painful scale than my left yet I have had no probs in that eye.The pain part is what worries me. Why would it happen suddenly and stop and then again on an off throughout the day. It can happen at rest as well as when I'm active.Does anyone have any thoughts?Many thanksMarisa"
Conjunctivitis,Help!!! I get really swollen red streamy eyes when I go on nights out! I don’t know what to do,"Hi everyone! I'm currently on my Erasmus year abroad in Spain and I've encountered a bit of a problem when I go on a night out - my eyes become extremely swollen, watery and very uncomfortable (pics attached). I have put this down to the cigarette smoke i come into contact with - as my friends here often smoke indoors in eachothers houses and often i am in the same room as them. I'm almost certain its not what I'm drinking as I drink the same vodka and cranberry juice here that i do at home in ireland - and this has never happened at home before (even over christmas when i was home). This doesnt happen every single night out but it seems to happen on the nights when people do smoke inside - being around people smoking outside isnt as big a problem ( less of a confined space i suppose). I've tried to prevent this by taking antihistamine tablets as well as anti histamine eye drops before I go out but it just doesnt seem to work!! **Does anyone have any suggestions as to what could be causing this or how I can prevent this from happening. **It causes such discomfort that i often have to go home early before the night has even begun...... PLEASE HELP"
Conjunctivitis,"Seeing halos, starburst and floaters in my eyes for 3 months","I had been for my regular eye checkup and my optometrist told me I am a glaucoma suspect(he saw bigger eye cupping). This happened in starting October last year. After a month, in second week of November, I started seeing halos around bright light, few of he lights i see rainbow halos. I went to my local optometrist and he told you might have dry eyes and gave me tear plus eye drop. In starting December, I started seeing starburst around the car headlights and most of them look like a rainbow glare light streaks. I also got 3-4 floaters in both of my eyes. I asked two ophthalmologist about starburst and floaters and no one had any answer. I had already changed my glasses a month back so changing of glasses option was rules out. Now, since a week my eyes are feeling dry, even the eye drops are not working.So many things are happening and myself or doctors have no idea what might be the cause. just posting here in case anybody might know anything. I am 30 years old male. I had my eye pressure checked this Jan starting, it was 15-16 in both the eyes."
Conjunctivitis,PVD in early 40's :((,"I'm a 42 year old female. About a week ago I started seeing lights in the outer corner of my left eye. It felt like the light you see in a photocopier, lasted for 2, 3 seconds. For a couple of days I didn't think too much and ignored it, until a friend of mine told me this could be a symptom for retinal detachment and I should go see a doctor right away. So I did, and was told that I have PVD (Posteriors Vitreous Detachment) in both eyes. I was told not to worry about retina tear, the chance is very low (phew).It's been a week since the first symptom and the flashing light seem to have got worse. I read somewhere that the first 6 weeks since the initial symptom is when most retinal tears happen...does that mean I aren't out of the woods yet? My doctor seemed very sure I would be fine...Also it seems that PVD is common for old aged people. I'm only 42...does it mean that my vision will deteriorate earlier than normal? Feeling a bit hopeless...(( Would love to hear if someone have similar experience..."

Conjunctivitis,Eyes feel like lead even though had good nights sleep,"For the past week I've been feeling very tied even though I've had a good nights sleep every night. I go to bed at 10:30pm and usually wake up before my alarm goes off at 6:15am. I don't remember waking up in the night and initially feel fine until after I get to work and sit down then my eyes feel puffy and heavy, I feel very tied all day long and can barely keep my eyes open.I get light-headed, not dizziness per say but I do feel slightly unsteady sometimes especially if I'm using my eyes a lot, like reading. I feel like I'm in control and can concentrate when driving to work and back. It seems to be worse when moving my eyes a lot.I work in a GP practice so I was able to get our HCA to give me a full blood test, the results came back with everything normal apart from my Biliirubin levels (it's what makes urine yellow - broken down from red blood cells). I had one of the doctors take a look and he thought I had Gilbert's Syndrome. As far as I can tell from a little research Gilbert's only symptom is the occasional jaundice and is a benign condition that effects 10-15% of the western population and is nothing to worry about.So I think spotting the Gilbert's Syndrome is just a coincidence and would have been there all the time anyway (it's a genetic condition) though I've noticed having jaundice.I also feel like I have pressure behind the eyes, and sinuses - though no pain or headaches which should rule out sinusitis. The best way to describe what I have is a lack of sleep, effecting my eyes even though I've a good nights sleep. I have no muscle aces or pain and don't have any brain confusion or disrupted vision in eyes. I'd been taking Loratidine for hayfever but stopped about two months ago, I've now resumed taking them thinking that perhaps I was having some kind of extreme reaction to pollens despite the lack of itchy eyes or runny nose. I take no other medication and I stopped drinking alcohol two days ago (I only have one alcoholic drink a day anyway).I spoke to a doctor about it where I work, actually two doctors, and they both agreed that it was probably viral and will pass in a few days. I'm finding it difficult to book an appointment with my own doctor (my own practice is notorious for not being able to get seen). I'm going to try again tomorrow to get an afternoon slot - failing that I'll have to see if one of the doctors where I work will consult me; I am a temporary patient now after all - had to register for the blood test. I'm also waiting for results of celiac disease due to having loose stools in the morning after breakfast for a long time now.Any thoughts?"
Conjunctivitis,Physical effort after the retinal detachment surgery,Hi.I had a retinal detachment surgery some time ago and my doctor advised me not to do physical effort.But I'm a guy who travel a lot and I need to wear the backpack for hours.Does this count as physical effort? Can this do harm to the retina? What would be a maximum safe weight that I could carry?Can you give me some tips about how should I proceed without putting too much strain on the eyes/retina?
Conjunctivitis,Is my eyesight threatened by this? ,"Hello, one day I was masturbating and I felt a sudden pain behind the eyes like a tightening or a cramp smh like that. Then for 2 weeks after that I had a pain with eye movements. This happened 8 months ago.It got away eventually and now the symptoms are way less but they keep up. No vision changes. Should I be worried about my eyesight after all these moths? Can masturbation cause blindness from hypertansion, or if something was wrong I would already have a problem with my sight and after 8 moths I shouldn't even think about it? I am afraid that something has happened and it will cause problems over the years or this is impossible?"
Conjunctivitis,eyes I have noticed that when I drink whiskey my eye sight improves ,my eye sight improves when I drink alcohol* but no one wants to hear this Its true I normally cant see the keyboard* or the screen but after a few drinks I can so what is happening . I saw someone else mention this but all I get is your eyes get blurry when you drink . This is not the case .Someone should investigate this more and stop trying to suppress this information I think there is a massive scam going on with the eye doctors an the glasses makers when you go to get a eye exam they scare you and tell you you could lose your drivers license when it is not true look at the chart the letter are grey on a light grey background make the letters black and you can see them clearly .the world is full of scam

Conjunctivitis,"Strange flashes in vision, similar to floaters. What are they? What should I do?","So, I'm 27 years old. I have been having a lot of issues with my vision recently and don't know what is going on. A couple months ago, I experienced an increase in floaters along with my entire vision flashing (it looked like someone was dimming the lights and turning them back on very quickly, happened mainly in the morning upon waking up) I went to the eye doctor, had a full exam with dilation, and he found nothing wrong. I wasn't very careful after this (wasn't really informed I should be) and didn't wear sunglasses. I had extreme sensitivity to light and dizziness for weeks following this (I believe due to the dilation and me not being careful afterwards) and it still hasn't completely gone back to normal.Now, I'm experiencing something new. They are these little ball shapes, that kinda look and behave like floaters. They appear randomly, floating away from the center of my vision, and disappear within a few moments, only to reappear a few minutes later. However, unlike floaters, they glow and flash brightly and are very hard to ignore, and I can see them over everything, even when watching TV and things like that, and can also see them in the dark. They are present almost all of the time now.I'm not sure what to do, and looking for some advice here. Does anyone here have any idea what might be happening to me? Should I go back to the Doctor for another exam? I would have already as I am quite worried about my eyes, but I'm also really scared of having my eyes dilated again after the side effects I experienced. Just really scared and don't know what to do, pls help me. ?"
Conjunctivitis,Hard to focus after retinal tear surgery,"Hello everyone,I had a retinal tear laser surgery two weeks ago in my right eye and ever since i have been having hard time focusing on close object (i.e reading books). This gets much worse when I have my prescription glasses on. Even though this seems to be getting better (or maybe am getting used it?), I was hoping if someone who faced the same problem would advise if this condition did go away? Its really been annoying and am getting a bit nervous.Thank you!"
Conjunctivitis,"Seeing tiny bright moving dots, are they eye flashes or?","For a few days now, I have noticed a new symptom to my floaters/flashes.I have been to the eye doctor exactly 12 days ago, no signs of tears or detachment was noticed during retinal exam.What I am seeing now however is different, whenever I am close to a light source, like a lamp, and I focus anywhere the light is heading, I see these little bright spots that kinda feel like flashes but behave differently, they move like gas bubbles in a fizzy drink, they appear at some place and travel up for a short distance until they disappear, they always move up.I have also been seeing what appear to be small dark floaters that don't quite follow the eye, this is very occasional however and I can't reproduce it on my own, but sometimes say if I move my head to the left my floaters follow along, but I may see what appears to be a floater going fast to the right, I'm still not sure about this one though because there might be a chance this is just certain images being stuck on my retina and leaving a dark image or something.So has anyone seen these type of eye flashes, if that's what they are? They kinda remind me as well of the Blue Field Entoptic Phenomenon, which I have also seen recently, but the spots in this case always go up like I said, not to mention that it happens inside and with regular lighting."

Conjunctivitis,Amblyopia/ Lazy Eye,"Specsavers did the Fixation Disparity test on me, and found I have a very mild issue of lazy eye in my right eye. My brain isn't processing all the information from my right eye when both my eyes are open.They said it is very weird because I have 20/20 vision and very mild Amblyopia but nothing to worry about.People around me only started noticing it about a year ago. and I've only started noticing it recently. My questions are:How could I have developed it as an adult? I'm 26 and I did a Lasik surgery 5 years ago to correct my short sightedness. Could that have caused it?Can it get worse?What should I do next?Thank you!"

Conjunctivitis,"text vibrating, after image and red eyes","Hi,I am having some issue with my eyes lately. Whenever I read, texts looks little vibrating. This happens more if the background is black and the text is while. My eyes also catch the afterimage of any bright object. Like last night, we were getting a picture clicked and the flash from camera was stuck in my head for literally 10 mins. I could see the flash in the vision. It's same when I', taking for someone and behind them is a bright background, moving my head and blinking still gives me a rough shadow structure of the person. Also, my eyes are pretty red when I wake up in the morning, it goes okies in afternoon but again go red in the night.Is there someone else who is going through the same thing?"
Conjunctivitis,Eye Pain / Headache - could this be connected to my Wisdom Tooth?,"I have been to a walk in centre and my doctor so far about pain I have been experiencing in my right eye only and brow / temple area on that side. My eye has been getting bloodshot and I have had a headache on that side for 2 weeks + now as well as slgiht blur in that eye and senstivity to light. I have tried antibacterial drops which have made no difference. I have been referred to an eye doctor who I am seeing on Friday, but I have also thought of the possibility that this might be connected to my upper right wisdom tooth. I have not had any pain in that tooth for quite some time but I do know from my last visit to the dentist that it was coming in horizontally. I have booked to go to the dentist tomorrow to have it looked at to find out if there is any infection going on I dont know about - although I would assume I would feel pain in that tooth but perhaps the pain is deferring to my eye area? What I want to know is could this be the cause of my eye pain / vision problems? There is a lot of conflicting opinion on the internet so would like to get an answer please!! I am hoping the dentist / eye doctor can help solve this for me but my doctor and walk in center provided no help on this matter!!"
Conjunctivitis,Eyes won't work together,"This is a problem I've had for many years but it used to only happen occasionally - I assumed it was due to fatigue and didn't stress about it. But now it's happening a lot and affecting the quality of my life. For part of the day my vision is fine (I either wear multi-focal contacts, or cheater readers. But then later in the day (especially when I'm outside) I will feel like one eye is doing all the work, like the other has become lazy, and like they won't focus together. One eye at a time they're fine, but both open the discrepancy actually makes me dizzy.I went to the doctor about it and he ran extensive tests, and what he told me was that since the astigmatism and prescription in my left eye was different than my right, I need to wear corrective lenses of some sort ALL DAY AND NIGHT. He said no more wearing cheater reading glasses - only prescription glasses or contacts. I don't really need correction for distance but he says if I don't wear the glasses all day this will continue to happen.Anyone else experience this? I catch myself often looking at things with one eye so that I don't experience this. That's not a good solution.Sue"
Conjunctivitis,What Is The Blemish Under My Eye ?,"Can anyone tell me what this blemish could be under my eye, it seems to have been there for several months now but just wondered what it was?"
Conjunctivitis,Did they see me coming get a mile off??,"Hello people,I went for my second ever eye test the other day at 46 and have been told by a well known optitian that I need glasses. I kind of knew that I needed glasses for reading as I've struggled reading for a while and I kind of accepted that.the results wereRightsph +0.25 cyl -0.75 axis 85.0near-add +1.50leftsph +0.25 cyl-0.50 axis135.0near-add 1.50I was expecting to buy a couple of pairs of half decent frames (buy 1 get 1 free) for reading but instead I've taken the optitians advice and bought varifocal lenses costing £159 for the glass and then the frames for both glasses.My question is do I really need to wear glasses all the time as I think the prescription readings above are quite low from what I've read ?would it make much difference wearing glasses for distance and could I get away with just reading glasses. If the difference is worth it then I don't mind paying the money out.Just felt they were more concerned with how many pennies were going in the till!Thank you.John"
Conjunctivitis,Dry eye has left me unable to read for long,I've been diagnosed with very dry eyes and am trying new drops and eye gel.I find I can only read for a few minutes without getting discomfort from my left eye. Does anyone have a similar problem and how did they deal with it?
Conjunctivitis,Try to get clear vision past 20ft.,I am 68 years old and have been wearing glasses for about 40 years.I get an eye exam by an ophthalmologist once a year. The glasses i'm currently wearing are two years old and are progressive lenses. My near vision and reading are fine and I can see clearly to about 20ft. Beyond 20 ft. every thing begins to blur. It is difficult to drive and read traffic and street signs until I an right up on them. I have explained this problem to my doctor and to a couple of optometrists in an attempt to correct the problem with confusing answers and little help. I have tried to get single vision sunglasses with my current prescription by they also do not provide clear vision beyond 20 ft. The best answer I got was that the standard vision test is set to 20 ft and does not take into account anything beyond 20 ft. This may explain why my sunglasses did not fix the issue. So their telling me that nobody with glasses can see clearly beyond 20 ft. ???There must be a million other with this same problem. Has anyone found a fix for this ?Help !
Conjunctivitis,"Weird eye problem, Stroke? Graves? Doctors have no clue :(","A couple of months ago I started having some eye issues. I have a very high prescription and normally use soft contact lenses. It started off in my right eye, it got very irritated, red and red and dry so I completely stopped wearing contacts and switched over to my back up glasses.I noticed my eye was looking off, maybe swollen or like lazy eye. the more I looked i thought it might even be popping out a bit. What really freaked me out was that I thought I had lost vision so I scheduled appointments with both my doctor and an ophthalmologist.THe doctor checked my TSH, for thyroid problems as I have also been having issues with sore, scratchy and itchy feeling in throat for almost a whole year. TSH was normal.The ophthalmologist confirmed that my prescription hasn't changed and determined that the blurred vision / double vision was a result from allergies and severe dry eye. I was prescribed ketotifen for the allergy and Systane over the counter for the dryness.My primary care diagnosed my with blepharitis and prescribed erythromycin antibiotics for my eye. It has been about a month on these meds and I have not seen any results. I am still having double vision in my right eye (i think it's gotten worse) and it's still very dry in the mornings. it looks off to me, almost like its misaligned or crooked. I don't know what could have caused this, hoping to get recommendations as to where to look next or any tests that might provide insights? "
Conjunctivitis,"Droopy eye after corneal abrasion, when does my injured eye fully open?","Hi All,I am 29 years old and I had a corneal abrasion exactly a month ago and I went to the doctor and he said it was not too bad and that the abrasion should fully heal in a couple of days. Well, he was right and I did feel better but I noticed that my eyelid was still considerably droopy. After a month, I can say that my eyelid has improved a lot but it is not yet how it was before my injury. People cannot really tell when they look at me (unless I point it out to them) but when I take pictures you can really tell. Basically in pictures, it looks like one eye is bigger than the other one. I'm getting worried that this is how my eye is going to stay. I would really appreciate someone letting me know if my eyelid is going to fully open up to the way it was before my corneal abrasion and if so, how long does it take? Keep in mind, it already has been a month. Someone with a similar experience that has gone through this? Thank you!"
Conjunctivitis,Weird issue! Forehead and contacts!,"Here are my details:-36-pregnant (10 weeks)-female-wear contacts and glasses-Rx is -4.75About three weeks ago i started getting this weird sensation in my forehead between my eyebrows. it felt like something was touching me or felt like a muscle tightening. no pain,no headaches. just an odd sensation.i normally wear my contacts except for at night. so i decided to give the contacts a break and just wear glasses and the sensation totally disappeared. i did this for one week. yesterday i decided to try to wear my contacts again and the sensation came back!i am wearing glasses today and it is gone. i tried Googling this and found zero info. i think i will make an appt with my eye doc but has anyone heard of this or experienced anything like this? i am worried and perplexed!"

Conjunctivitis, Does anyone know more about keratoconus? Is it hereditary?,"Hi,Most of us might have experienced one or the other eye issues. Recently my husband was diagnosed with keratoconus. He had mild blurring of vision. But, we didn't care about it at the beginning. But, later we observed some kind of swelling in his eyes. When consulted an ophthalmologist, he suggested undergoing Keratoconus Surgery.They said there is an increased chance of keratoconus if you have a family history of keratoconus. I'm worried about my child, he also has slight vision issues. Does anyone know more about this? Is it hereditary? Share your insights.Thanks!Moderator comment: I have removed the link(s) directing to site(s) unsuitable for inclusion in the forums.

Conjunctivitis,Images being stuck on retina for longer than usual,"Everyone has gotten that weird negative effect that you see when you close your eyes after having stared at or somewhere near a bright light. However as I understand, the after image should disappear quickly, what could cause an image to be stuck for what feels like longer than usual? Say a random house light for about 2 minutes or so. Is this normal?"

Conjunctivitis,trouble reading small text,"In case it is relevant I am extremely near sighted and have a very powerful rx. However in recent years I've been more and more trouble reading small text. Really small print labels I can't read it all, many web pages on my phone I must strain to read the text, and I need to use a fairly big font on my Kindle for comfortable reading.I went to a drugstore and tried every available strength of reading glasses from 1.25x up to 3. None of them seem suitable for me at all. Looking through them everything is extremely blurry and the only way I can read at all through them is by holding my phone really close to my eyes, a distance I would never read from anyway. I can actually read more clearly with my glasses on or even off than wearing those reading glasses.So I am a little puzzled about what all this means. If I went to an optometrist would I be able to get an rx for the perfect pair of reading glasses which wouldn't be blurry, or is the blurriness always going to be an issue when I remove my normal glasses because I am so near sighted?Thanks for your input!"

Conjunctivitis,23 year old seeing black spot in left eye when moving it,"Hi, I am a 23 year old. I've been seeing a black spot in my left eye when moving it or my head quite often. It's been going on for a little while. I've never had this kind of problem before and do not have vision problems in general. I do not wear glasses or contacts. It seems to be a problem with the that eye and not my left visual field because I've never noticed it with my left eye covered and looking out of my right eye. Does anyone have any ideas what this could be?"
Conjunctivitis,Various strange problems - currently pupils went near the top of the iris,"I have DID. Look it up, think of it how you will, don't know if it pertains but it might, ect.Background:One time, several years ago, due to severe stress (I think), I went completely blind for about a month. Didn't go to the eye doctor, I really don't know why not. Just had my sister take care of me and stayed at home.Last month my eyes were leaking fluid sometimes. I would wake up with this goop on my pillow that came from my eyes.First two images show some weird silver stuff in the bottom left hand corner. It was grainy, and sandpaper-y for lack of a better term, to close my eye.Eventually it started resolving and the color came back as you can see in the third picture.Eyes are leaking slightly again. Don't care about that.Earlier today, everything started looking... hyper real. Like high definition clarity, everything was too in focus, too detailed, ect.Checked my eyes in the mirror in the elevator to my apartment, just because I felt some leaking.Anyways, I saw that the pupils had moved to very near the top of the iris.Didn't take a picture. Immediately took some lorazepam and it seems better... based on the lack of hyper realism. Not really feeling like looking at that again though.Anyways, any ideas? I know I should get checked or something but I do that once a year anyways and the verdict is basically I have slight astigmatism in my right eye and need some weak glasses."

Conjunctivitis,"PVD symptoms that continue or change over time, is it normal?","I know, yet another PVD topic right? Well yeah, but I really wanted to talk about my issues and hopefully realize maybe I'm not doing as bad as I think.The first time I ever saw what I guess would become eye floaters I was in grade school, my grandpa, who was about 60 at the time, told how you could see tiny things inside your eyes if you squinted by a bright light, I remember seeing something and then never thinking about it again.When I was about 18 I got my first real eye floaters, it was quite frightening at first, got to see an eye doctor and had a retinal exam with dilated pupils, he found nothing wrong. It was annoying but eventually I managed to ignore most of them even if I could still see them.This July/August I suddenly realized, after waking up, that I could see many more eye floaters than I did before, at least 3 or 4 times as many if not more. I remember I was dealing with eye strain at the time, and because I had had floaters before I tried not to think much about it, even though there was obviously something out of the ordinary. One day I woke up with a blurry eye, which may have taken at least about 2 or 3 minutes to clear up but then mt vision was back to normal.In October I also started seeing, for the first time, eye flashes. I had seen ""stars"" before after spending several hours on the computer, but this was different and happened at any time, small bright dots that disappeared in less than a second.So I finally started getting really worried and went to my eye doctor, the same one who had seen me 12 years ago, he got my pupils dilated, took some photographs and took a well look at both of my eyes. He also did a regular eye exam to see if my vision had not abruptly deteriorated since, which it didn't. He found no signs of tears or detachment on any retina and asked me to come back in a year for another checkup.So apparently this is all due to regular PVD, at 30 years old, which to be honest made me feel quite satisfied, at least until the next day.A week has passed since my appointment, and my symptoms have changed, my eye floaters are still many but they appear to be less and are less noticeable, I had a big one that I could see all the time, even in low light, now it's still there but it feels smoother and maybe a little bit smaller. It also appears that some of the smaller floaters might have grouped together at the edges of my eye, because I see these thick lines fall down whenever I look up and then down. left and the right or viceversa. They look dark outside and actually white inside, as if there was light in them. The flashes calmed down for a couple days but incidentally today I had what I think was the worst one yet, before they looked bright but seemed like stars in the night sky, today this big one looked like a camera flash, and several other smaller ones.So if you've read at least some of my story I'd appreciate it if you could help me understand this better. Does this sound like normal PVD, with symptoms changing within these weeks? If I had no damage done to my retina when it was checked out, am I still at risk? My vision has not gotten worse, and I have not had peripheral vision loss to my sides, when is the right time to come back for a checkup with these symptoms? What else can I expect?I have dealt with anxiety for many years and health issues always brings the worst of it for me, so this is really a problem for my mental state, I keep checking for new symptoms all the time and seeing if the lines and floaters change, I have literally caused myself eye strain for looking for them all the time, it makes it very difficult to concentrate at work or anything in particular.Thank you for chiming in!"

Conjunctivitis,Blocked tear duct and bleparitis,"About 6 months ago I went to my doctor as I had red itchy eyes. He looked at me and said I had blepharitis and told me to see an optician though did prescribe chloramphenicol cream. I went to a branch of a well known chemist chain, where the optician looked at my eyes and said I had a blocked tear duct in one of them apparently this could cause blepharitis. She advised me to use a heated pad on my eyes and clean them with baby shampoo for two weeks. After that time I nothing had changed so i rang them and was then told to see my doctor, which i was reluctant to do as he had been quite dismissive before. I stuck it out for a few weeks then went to another optician who said the blockage could be removed quite easily. He made me an appointment with an NHS opthalmologist who only said I had blepharitis . I had to make a second appointment so that he could test for a blocked tear duct. He inserted dye into my eye and when it didn't come out, he confirmed what I had already told him, that I had a blocked tear duct. Ahhgh! The only option he said could fix it was an operation to bypass the tear duct via my nose, an operation he described as ""very nasty"" and with only a 70% success rate. He was really grumpy and didn't give me much confidence in him. I never got round to asking about syringing the blockage. He did recommend hyloforte tears for blepharitis but this just runs out of my eye and people think I'm crying. I use vitapos at night which helps a bit but my eye is very sore where I'm dabbing it to remove the moisture so that I can see. Can one offer advice as to what options are out there to clear a blocked tear duct and given the NHS eye doctor was so unhelpful, as there any private options I could follow. I was thinking of going to a private opthalmologist but don't know if will be an expensive waste of money. Thanks"
Conjunctivitis,LCD monitors/tvs/phones Cause SEVERE Eye Problems. (FACTS PROVIDED),"Hello, I'm basically here to explain my discovery with using phones, or anything with LCD technology (which is like everything these days). In hopes to save your eyes and maybe figure out a cure.Now obviously this doesn't apply to everyone because everyone seems to be using their phones and monitors and tv's fine.But here it goes.. When I was about 24, I decided it was time to upgrade my old CRT Monitor and buy a new widescreen LCD monitor, I noticed a bunch of problems as soon as I got it. I was teary eyed, Itchy Eyes, Pain behind the eye. I read that your eyes take a while to adjust to the new technology so I mistakenly stuck it out for awhile, over the course of maybe a month or something I had a vision full of floaters, weird peripheral vision (edges and lights were really weird) and severe pain behind the eye.I stopped using the monitor and went to an ophthalmologist, I was the only one in there even near my age. I ended up having 3 tears in my retina in one eye and 2 in the other. A problem seen with boxers (trauma to the eye) and old people (eye degeneration).I knew (despite the science at the time) it was from that monitor. I went back to a crt monitor, after a few months my brain crossed out the floaters and everything was seemingly back to normal.About 3-4 years later I saw a deal one a LED 50 inch tv and bought it (completely forgetting about any problems with the technology, I want you guys to understand this isn't placebo in any way). within a couple days of using it everything from before started happening again, Weird edges, Floaters, Severe eye pain. I returned to the ophthalmologist to check my previous tears which had laser surgery prior, A surgery that scars the tear to help it hold. Everything appeared to be alright so I think I avoided problems by not continuing using the tv.Again, I stopped using the technology and moved on with life, 3 years later and after doing some research I wanted to buy a monitor with newer technology (blue light filter, flicker free, etc.) because these are the problems I read that seemed like a likely culprit to causing the problem. So I bought one and AGAIN all the same issues occurred within a week of use.I stopped, life went on and now I'm posting this because recently started using my phone (used it only for calls prior) and everything occurred again.I want to state I have no eye problems other than this. I don't wear glasses, I have no problem looking at a crt, Literally can look at one all day and I use plasma TV's in my home which I can watch all day as well with no problem.So I'm 100% sure the problem lies within me (genetically) and LCD technology which is in everything right now..A) I want people feeling any of these effects to be aware of thisB) Maybe someone can solve the mystery of what is happening with liquid crystal display and the aforementioned issues. I thought It was blue light, but had the blue light filter glasses and a monitor that had blue light filter on. Then I thought it was because of the PWM flicker, I got a monitor that rid that as well. Then I thought maybe it had something to do with the static image, so I tried to run the monitor in blur reduction mode which essentially make it operate like a crt monitor refreshing all the time. Nothing helped but who knows maybe someone will be able to figure this out?"

One at the top, one in the middle and one at the lower end. Both eyes same spot always there. The other symptoms have subsided but the lines have remained there. We saw several optometrists, neurooptometrists, and neurologists all of which have said everything is fine with him.

Conjunctivitis,Having vision issues so weeks after the exam? Anyone ever experienced anything like this? Help? :(,"Hello, new here. I had started seeing some floaters and went to my Eye Doctor. He was concerned about Retinal Detachment, and decided to dilate my eyes with special drops and check them. This was the first time I had ever had my eyes dilated. The Doc said my eyes and vision were fine, and the floaters were nothing to worry about. However, following the test, I experienced horrible and strange vision symptoms for hours afterwards (blurry vision and extreme sensitivity to light, mainly). I wasn't really aware that you should avoid light and such after such an exam, and really wasn't probably as careful as I should've been. I exposed my eyes to plenty of light, tried to watch TV, etc., which only made them feel worse.The day after, these symptoms had gone away, only to be replaced with something much worse. It's difficult to describe, but when looking at bright lights or images, or even just something ""busy"" (like a grocery isle with lots of different food items) my eyes will start to ""ache"", I guess? It's a strange sensation that is hard to describe, not pain exactly, but similar to it. They will ache more and more, and it will also become difficult to focus on whatever I'm looking at, and I will also start to feel dizzy a bit. This feeling continues until I look away from whatever is causing my eyes distress.It has been like this for almost two weeks now, and has not really gotten better. I can't watch TV for long, and have to wear sunglasses when going outside. I'm not sure where to turn for this. Can't find much Online, and I'm terrified to go back to the Eye Doctor, because I fear he will want to do more tests which could make it even worse. Has anyone here experienced anything like this? Could I have severely strained or maybe even damaged my eyes because I wasn't careful enough after the eye exam? Any info or advice would greatly appreciated, please help me. ?"
Conjunctivitis,Retinal tears/detachment ,"Hello,If someone help me with similar case likemine I would be more then grateful.In May this year (2019) I started to develop like a arc like flash in my left eye and it's only happening in dim light or evening. I went to the doctor (3 doctors) and they said that my retina is nice and healthy beside the fact that I am high myopic (-9 with -3 astigmatism left and -6 with -2 astigmatism right). Yesterday I went to the opticians because my symptoms didn't settle down and again nothing it's wrong, I also have floters and transparent lines when I am in a light room or plain white wall, but those I had them since primary school. I am very anxious that I will loose my vision. Can someone help me with their advice how to get over this? If I don't have retinal tears, vitreous detachment then what can this be?many thanks,Suzana"
Conjunctivitis,"Computer Monitor Problems (Prior PRK/laser, dry eye)","Good evening!I am in my mid-30s and have a job that requires me to use computers nearly all day.

Unlike normal ""Computer Vision Syndrome,"" I have problems immediately when seated in front of an LCD monitor. My eyes feel extremely overwhelmed and like there is a pressure behind them.

Conjunctivitis,"Vision worse in one eye, glasses make it worse","Hi all,For as long as I can remember the vision in my left eye has been worse than my right eye which is basically perfect. As well as blurry vision in my left eye that I would assume would normally be corrected with glasses, the actual visual acuity seems to be quite poor and even with corrective lenses, the vision from my left eye seems darker and grainy and faded.I'm in my mid twenties and it has never really bothered me because my right eye seems to compensate and day-to-day I can see fine, and don't notice any issues with peripheral vision.I have been prescribed glasses in the past to help correct the vision in my left eye, however I find when I wear them that my vision is actually worse, i think because my bad eye contributes more to my overall vision. I'm much more comfortable without glasses.Any ideas as to what might be the problem with my left eye?"

Conjunctivitis,Think I may have vertical heterophoria. Who should I see in the UK? ,"Hey.I believe that I may have vertical heterophoria. I have been for an eye exam in the last few weeks at an opticians, but I'm unsure as to whether or not they would have tested for this, since I have read that opticians usually do not pick this sort of thing up.I am wondering who I could see in the UK that would definitely test for this? As this would hopefully put and end to my awful symptoms.If you need any information let me know."
Conjunctivitis,"floaters and flashes, examined in eye hospital,","Had floaters for couple of decades, 60 now, and got some new floaters about a week ago in one eye, and this time though with flashes and still do, not there all the time with the flashes, but every day and read about the possible detached retina symptoms or tear. Went to eye hospital and got drops put in and they examined all the eye, retina etc...Said all looked normal, Flashes can just be accompanied by floaters when the virteous stuff leaks a bit, not necessarily a detached retina. Sez it may continue but all fine as regards the eye health in general. I can put up with the floaters even though annoying as a couple of the blobs pass in front of my eye, dancing around, but the flashes still worry me a bit, but hospital says all ok, do i still worry>??"
Conjunctivitis,Delayed reaction to contact lenses,"Been a contact lens wearer for 30 years with no major issues with any types of lenses. However my latest set of lenses are causing a delayed reaction causing redness and burning sensation, can wear for as little as 15 minutes then several hours later eyes have reacted, no reaction during wear or when first taken out. Redness and soreness can then take 7-10 days to completely clear. Fit is ok, and slight tweaks to lens fit haven't made any difference, this has now been going on for 18 months, and trying lenses from different manufacturers hasn't made any difference.One lens is KCSL 17mm, other eye is Scleral 21mm. Despite different lenses in each eye reaction is the same. Unfortunately I lost my last Screral lens but was on paper an exact match and never had an issue, still have old KCSL for other eye and can wear 18 hours a day with no problem. I'm told it's a fit issue but I'm not convinced, to me it seems more a coating/material reaction and that something must have change but I cannot back this up, or find anyone else with a similar problem."
Conjunctivitis,Question about new prescription for eye contacts,"am i overthinking this or should i be concerned?i went for my annual eye exam a couple days ago to renew my eye contact prescription. this past year i've been wearing -2.75 power in both eyes and haven't had any issues with them. so after the eye exam, the eye doctor says that the right eye should go up to -3.00. Which i agree with because i do notice the right eye seems alittle more blurry. And then he said something like ""i think maybe your left eye could maybe go down to -2.50"". So then i was like ""oh so it isn't -2.75 anymore?"". But then he was like 'oh well yeah we can actually keep you at -2.75 in your left eye'. And then i was like 'oh but i do want to be accurate though...'. But then he was like ""oh no it should be fine..keeping -2.75 in the left eye will be fine.' So my prescription now is -3.00 in my right eye and -2.75 in the left eye.But should i be concerned that maybe the left eye should be -2.50 because that's what he first mentioned? but then he was like -2.75 is fine too because its just .25 difference.i have been wearing the new contacts (3.00 in right and -2.75 in left) the past few days and i haven't noticed any problems. i might be overthinking everything but i just want to be sure."
Conjunctivitis,"My eyelids fold inside out and I pant when I sleep, why have I been referred to a neurologist?","Hey so a partner noticed my eyelids fold inside out while I sleep and I start breathing really weird, when I ask what do you mean? He just says panting. I'm a 25 year old, overweight, white male.I've been to a doctor and showed him a photo my friend took of my eyelid folded inside out while sleeping and he thought about sending to me a sleep clinic and then sounded like he went for a neurologist referral.But honestly I have no clue whats going on here. So why a neurologist, what are they looking for/to rule out?And also what possible things cause this? Any ideas? I can't find anything.My health history aside from mental health is tonsillitis, alcohol and substance abuse. I smoke around 25 a day. I don't get great sleep, I was put on diazepam for 3 days which helped a bit but not really.."

Conjunctivitis,Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD): How long to resolve?,"PVD is supposedly very common in those over age 65. (I'm 73.) I experienced a significant PVD event in my right eye 3 weeks ago. My vision was very blurred in that eye and I had a lot of eye strain. However, I wasn't yet familiar with ""PVD"" so I immediately went to my eye doctor. He thoroughly examined and tested my eyes and made the diagnosis. He said there was nothing I could have done to prevent it and there is no way to treat it......except through time and nature taking its course. He said the vitreous material will dissipate into smaller pieces as time goes by (2 to 6 months) and my brain will compensate for some of the focus problem. The doctor said to alleviate the eye strain issue, I should shut my eyes for 10 minutes or so until the pain subsides.It's now been 3 weeks for me and I do sense some decrease in my focusing problem (especially reading/computer use) and eye strain, but the problem is still there. Has anyone been through a significant PVD experience? After the 2 to 6 months, did you find that the problem was essentially all gone and your focus was back to what it was pre-PVD?"
Conjunctivitis,Positioning after eye surgery,"Hi everyone. This is my first post. I am on the waiting list for eye surgery - cataract removal, retinal membrane removal and vitrectomy. The nurse at the pre-op mentioned positioning but said I would be told more about that on the day. I have done some research and found that I may have to spend most of my time face down for 3 weeks. Does anyone have any experience of this or any tips to help me get through it, please? I live on my own but family and friends will help.Thanks for any replies."

Conjunctivitis,Castor oil for dry eyes,I have suffered with dry itchy red irritable eyes for years. Tried all the drops creams eyelid sprays none of them really helped hardly at all. I have read that castor oil really helps people with dry eyes by using them as eye drops. Also you can actually buy castor oil drops. When i went into boots to ask about them they didn't sell either and also said they wouldn't recommend using castor oil in the eyes but didn't give much of a reason why. I'm a bit confused now as i read some really good reports from people using them. Has anyone here ever used castor oil/drops for dry eyes and got any good reports. I just don't know whether to try it or not. I hope someone can help. I have suffered with dry itchy red irritable eyes for years.

Conjunctivitis,I can at times seeing wing like patterns in my eyes,"The wing pattern that i can see in my eyes is similar to when you stare direct at the sun and end up with spots in your vision for a while, the wing patterns however can occur in my eyes at points where i haven't even stared at the sun at all. The reason i am asking about this is that i am left feeling sick and well faint whenever this occurs and it can occur at any time so leaves me feeling very bad in the middle of important events.BTW i have put this under dry eyes as i need to select a group but the two eye groups didn't suit my question so i just went with dry eyes"

Conjunctivitis,Severe eye pain and visual disturbances constantly getting worse,"I Have been dealing with an undiagnosed illness for two years now. I have been to every specialist imaginable to no avail. I finally pushed myself to go back to work in December and about 5 weeks ago it hit me again worse than ever. The absolute worst things are severe debilitating eye pain that’s never ending, eyes continually getting worse red, and visual disturbances that have gotten dramatically worse the last five weeks. Constantly see light burned into my eyes even with my eyes closed see white flying dots all the time bad eye floaters severe light sensitivity repeatedly seeing objects everything I look at at times almost constantly seeing my heartbeat in my eyes now all the time and so much more. weird head feelings and clogged ears random muscle twitches hands constantly going numb and im sure theres more im missing. About the only thing that helps with the severe eye pain is nerve medicine which makes no sense It is like living the worlds worst nightmare. Also my blood pressure has been running dangerously high and had to start blood pressure medicine. i cannot find anyone that has dealt with anything like this if theres anyone that can help in any way please do."
Conjunctivitis,Blue spots in vision,"HiI have an eye condition which started i 2014 when I had a severe concussion when I hit my head.I see blue spots or fields in my vision, that seem to appear randomly across my vision field. They appear mainly at night under certain light conditions. They frequently appear when I am out driving when its dark outside. I have tried covering one eye with my hand, and I am not entirely sure about this, but it seems like they only appear when I look through both eyes. At less its much less when I look through one eye. The condition has been stable for many years, with no improvement or worsening. But during the last 6 months now it seems more severe. The bluespots/fields at night seem larger and I also see things during daytime now. On some occasions I see a small and bright blue spot, kind of like a dead pixel on a computer screen or like a small hole in a curtain that light shines through. Its only there for a second before it disappears. I have also noticed a small blurry spot in my right eye corner which is not colored.I cant find any information on this when searching. Can anyone make something out of this and maybe point me in a direction?"

Conjunctivitis,Eye floater,"51 yr old male. retina macular specialist said that I do not have macular degeneration. Doctor ran all kinds of different test. The conclusion was very few and small hard drusens and vetrous opacities, which are floaters. On an Amsler Grid I can see a a small part of a box with a slight bend. Mini blinds on windows may have a slight bend. Doctor said it is a floater in my axis vision. in other words right near the center. He said in a few months it should go away. has anyone ever experienced floaters causing this?"
Conjunctivitis,That thing appeared in my eyeball and im very afraid,"Today a friend told me that i had something strange in my eye so i opened the camera and thought that it was a big vein, but now i have taken a photograph and i'm shooked. My eye sometimes itches but not too much and it started to itch when i was in a trip to the south of Spain, that day i thought something enteres to my eyeball but i didnt see nothing. Now i see that and all makes sense. I thought that it was a type of worm or something but the pictures i saw were white lines and this is red, i dont know what to spect now.the picture:https://m.imgur.com/gallery/yqbwh3I"
Conjunctivitis,Vertical Lines That Follow Focal Point,My daughter aged 13 started complaining for a week of vertical lines that follows her focal point and she has headache associated as well. Its about 3 lines total in both eyes. It is not a solid black or white line but sort of invisible line. Her vision is -1 in both eyes and OCT looks fine. Opthomologist say nothing to worry after examining visually. Anyone experience this? Is this temporary or will go away?
Conjunctivitis,Floaters,"I have to believe that because floaters are so common that there have to be some eye care professionals (opthalmologist) that have them as well. I'm curious how they handle them as they can seriously be debilitating. Not all floaters are created equal. There are some that are not bothersome at all. A squiggly line or a dot that passes back and forth. What I have (and many others too) is a smudge, a blob that moves when my eye moves. If my eye is fixated I don't see it but every time my eye moves the floater goes past my central line of vision. Very unnerving especially while driving. My point here is that every time this is mentioned to people in they eye profession they fluff it off as though it is nothing and it will settle on its own, or we will get used it. So curious what they do. Because they truly are not easy to ignore."
Conjunctivitis,Is this episcleritis?,"My right eye has looked like this for three weeks... going back to the Dr next week. He said initially it was caused by dry eye, which I'm sure is part of it.... but does this look like episcleritis? Feeling very frustrated and bummed that it hasn't changed or improved in all this time. Have you ever had it for this long? I've never had any eye issues like this before! I'm only using moisture drops and heat compresses thus far."
Conjunctivitis,Having trouble with left eye seeing darker and more blurry than my right eye.,So I am 30 years old and about 2 weeks ago I started noticing that my vision was off. Also my balance. When I close my left eye I see perfect but when I close my right eye my vision is darker and more blurry. I work in a cabinet supply store so I thought maybe a piece of wood flew in and splintered my eye but it doesn't hurt or itch. There are times when I look up and it aches then the headaches start but i really don't know what it is. Should I see an optometrist or a doctor?
Conjunctivitis,Blob type floater in left eye,"Hi, I'm curious if anyone on this forum has a similar blob type floater. I've asked this question already but I'm now just looking for support and comparison. Doctor says its a floater and retina is fine. My concern is it is not a squiggly line floater which, to me, is not as bothersome. If anyone can relate can you describe your floater and maybe suggest what you do for it, if anything. Thank you"
Conjunctivitis,Could this cause long term damage? ,"Hi everyone,I was lying in bed ready to go to sleep in a dark room. Before going to sleep I moved aside the blinds to look out the window and because it was so dark and I couldn't see what I was doing. I felt a pain in my eye, I had whacked myself in the eye with the blinds (they're thick black out blinds) Very silly I know. It hurt because it both touched my eye and because it hit it. My eye was obviously hurting and I quickly put water on it and looked in the mirror, comparing it with the other one. It looks the same as the other one just redder. It took about a minute and the pain eased but it still feels sensitive. My vision is fine as I tested it by comparing both my eyes. What I'm worried about is if I could have done damage to my eye and not had the effects yet. I started getting a headache, and it feels like it's more on the side of the eye I hurt but I'm not sure if I'm imagining it. They hypercondriact in me is wondering if should I go to the doctors to check or am I just overreacting. I often have inner battles with myself about if I should go to the doctors or not. Thanks in advance."
Conjunctivitis,Blurryness in right eye which comes and goes multiple times per day for 3 years,"Ive had eye tests all these years, but nothing showed up.

Conjunctivitis,Eyelashe and Eyebrow loss ,"Has anyone experienced loss of both eyelashes and eyebrow hairs?No one can diagnose what I have or what could possibly be causing this.Apparently it is not blephartis, or my thyroid. I don't know what to do. I started taking Omega-3 and biotin but I lose lashes and eyebrow hairs daily."
Conjunctivitis,What is happening to me? ,"Recently my eyes have felt weird. I have had floaters for as long as I can remember. I am about -7 in both eyes and my eyes have been healthy. I feel like my floaters are becoming more visible (not more of them), my eyes are twitching a lot more (even after a good sleep), they feel strained, more pressurized and occasionally I will get a flash or two at night (not like flashes as in lightning or anything) but a light flash when I open my eyes in a dark room. I also feel a slight sharp pain in the side of the left side of my face around the ear canal and sinuses. And occasionally feel nauseous.Should I get a check up? What is happening to me? Is it stress? Bad diet? Erratic sleeping patterns? Not drinking enough water?"

Conjunctivitis,Snell Chart reading,"How much time do you spend reading a line on the Snell Eye Chart?I have been going to the Eye Doctor quite a bit lately and most of the techs that administer the test ask me what the lowest line is that I can read. I'd take my time, letter by letter and could just eek out what letter it was. The test never made sense to me because in real life I can't spend seconds on trying to read ONE letter . Then the most recent tech asked me ""what the lowest line is that I can COMFORTABLY read."" How much time do you spend reading a line/or a character on the eye chart?"

Conjunctivitis,Recurrent Erosion Syndrome - Help Needed !,Six or seven years ago I accidentally caught my left eye on the edge of a piece of paper !Ended up in my local A&E department who advised me to go to Moorfields who confirmed the corneal abrasion and prescribed antibiotic eye drops and lubricants. Unfortunately for me I discovered that I'm highly allergic to lanolin which is in about 95% of eye lubricants currently on the market.I mainly had to manage my RES with viscotears or its brand equivalent until November 2018 when I developed a sensitivity to this product !Since then I have been symptom free as long as I drink plenty of water during the day (about 3 -4 litres). Unfortunately now the warmer weather is here I am again experiencing symptoms - waking up three or four times during the night with a watering left eye or minor rips.Currently don't know what to try next or where else to go for help and advice - does anyone have any suggestions ?
Conjunctivitis,Woke up with one eye smaller! HELP PLS. ,"Hello, I woke up on July 17th and noticed that my left eye was way smaller than my right eye. I'm 26 year old female and have never had this problem before. The night before I had a very bad headache and even the day before that. I'm not sure if that could play a role in it. My mom's house is pretty dusty and dirty and the room I slept in hasn't been cleaned in a long time. Its been 2 days now and my eye still looks the same. I'm no longer around those same allergens. I have no pain, no discharge or swelling. The only thing that I have is some redness and that it looks like my eye shrunk! Has anyone had this experience before?"

Conjunctivitis,Persistent eye twitch,"Hi everyone,So my lower right eyelid has been twitching/pulsing for two months now. It twitches every second of every day even while I'm asleep (according to my fiance). I don't have any other obvious symptoms. My GP has dismissed it as nothing to worry about, but it's been happening for so long now that I feel it should be taken more seriously?Has anyone else had a twitch for this long? And any suggestions to how I can get it to stop?"
Conjunctivitis,Patch of pixelated vision,"I had a problem with seeing a white arc that I was seeing with movement of my left eye a few months ago. It's still there but not so bad. But I now have a new problem. On the 20th Feb, 4.5 months ago, I went to the hospital for a pupil dilation exam to see why I was seeing the white arc. No problem was found, but ever since then I have on odd occasions experienced this other problem -- a roundish patch of pixelated/fractured? vision in the same left eye around the centre of my left eye vision. It was appearing maybe once a day for between 10-20 mins. Thought it was a new floater initially but it's not. There's no problem with my right eye.Anyway, at first it was lasting around 20 minutes and quite bad. In recent weeks they're only been lasting 5 minutes and are much less noticeable. If I look at the sky in the daylight I can see it during those 5 minutes, although sometimes I can't and it only becomes visible when I move my eye.The severity of the episodes tends to be decreasing as time goes on, but not the frequency with which they occur.I think that sometimes they are brought on when I'm bent over doing something then I straighten up. So something to do with change in blood pressure? Also they appear to be occurring more frequently when I'm feeling stressed, but I can't say this for definite.Anyway, a bit reluctant to go back for further tests as it seems it was the eye dilation exam that precipitated it in the first place, either that or the eye drop. Any suggestions as to the likelihood of what it might be?"
Conjunctivitis,Dry Eye & One eyelid seemingly lower than other (picture included),"For 7-8 months ive had bad dry eye.

Conjunctivitis,"Something in my eye, feeling continues on and off, doctors find nothing, other symptoms","For reference, I am writing this on Saturday night. I’m so sorry this is such a long post but I would love for someone to read and help.On Tuesday night, I suddenly had a very obvious feeling that I had something in my eye. I wasn't doing anything in particular to cause it, I was just standing in my kitchen. All through Wednesday, I was trying to get it out but I couldn’t see it anywhere. It was there for 18 hours before I went to A&E at the hospital to get it checked. I couldn't see an eye specialist but the doctor I saw still did a general check. He dropped some numbing liquid into my eye then checked my upper eyelid and couldn't find anything. He then dripped that special yellow dye into my eye to see it better and still could not find anything special. He did find a hair at my eye and he said he doesn’t know if that was the actual cause and it could’ve just been coincidental that it was there at the time. My eye was still numb until later in the night, when it started aching an awful lot and hurt underneath and on the side of it and it was swollen on the bottom and the side. I also still felt like something was in my eye, but the feeling was just in my lower eyelid now, whereas before it moved many times.The feeling stayed and on Friday I went to my GP to check it again to make sure it isn’t infected. A nurse practitioner looked at my eyes and used the yellow dye again to look further and said she can’t find any scratches or any foreign object in my eye either. Although she didn’t mention any infection, she told me to buy chloramphenicol eye drops and use them four times a day for a week. I used them 4 times on Friday and 4 times on Saturday.I must admit that I am feeling a bit of relief. When I am occupied during the day, I sometimes even forget about my eye. But I still sometimes (not always) feel like there is something in my lower eyelid, most commonly in the outside corner, but it isn’t bothering my eye that much. My eyelid is also swollen my eyelids stick together on the outside, I see a lot worse colour blocks after looking at light than usual (sometimes accompanied by a little pain), my eye feels gritty and all around it aches. These symptoms happen almost only at night.I am wondering if the eye drops will really help, if it sounds like I have an infection (though neither of the doctors I saw told me I did), and if it’s possible that the foreign object is still in my eye."
Conjunctivitis,Double eye infection that will not go away and doctors cant determine cause,"hi, I recently had an eye injury.

Conjunctivitis,blind spot in one eye,"Hello, I'm a 52 year old male. Right now I have a gray spot at the upper right side of the center vision of my left eye. It all started one month ago, I took an international long flight, in order to reduce the timezone effect, I forced myself to watch video for 8 hours, and was really tired when I arrived. The second day, I noticed my upper left eyelid felt very heavy and twitched a lot. One day later I felt pain with both my eye balls and it lasted one day. And then one day later, both my eyes became extremely dry/red/itchy, so I used some eye drops. This lasted a few days. Since it didn't affect my vision, I continued doing my research/reading with cellphone and computer. And then one morning, I felt uncomfortable with my vision when under the sun. I suddenly discovered I had a blind spot close to the center of my left eye. So I went to see the eye doctor and took lots of exams(incl. OCT, blood vessel angiography, vision field test etc). The doctor did not find anything wrong with the main blood vessel and he could not conclude on the root cause. He suspected it was caused by either an infection or a tiny clot in a small blood vessel(since I have high cholesterol level) right behind the retina. He said the swelling on the retina might be relieved a bit after taking medications he prescribed.It has been three weeks since then. Right now I get tired very easily as my right eye has to compensate for that, and it becomes very difficult to use computer this way.Does anyone have any experience or insight in the cause? thanks in advance."
Conjunctivitis,Dry Ear Syndrome,"I get soreness on the cheek under one eye when I apply pressure, the eye constantly feels like I have something in it, its sore and mild pain around the eye. sometimes get blotches in the eye but when I blink it usually goes. Inner eye feels sore, but when I look at my eye it looks fine no redness or anything. Doc wants to give me steroids to treat possible neuralgia pain but I wonder if the causes are Dry Eyes as the optician said my eyes are very dry and gave me drops but ive noticed no improvement and been taking the drops for 3 days. I have a day drops and a paste thing I put in my eye at night. Would dry eyes cause all my symptoms?Anyone have any similar experiences ?"
Conjunctivitis,What is on my iris?,today i was randomly taking pictures of my eyes and noticed something cloudy like on my left eye i thought it was just the lighting so i took a few more and there is something there. i have no pain or sensitivity and my vision isn't really blurry either. i looked this up and cataracts match up the most but I'm only twenty two. i go tanning a couple times a week( i know its terrible) but i ALWAYS use protective eye wear and still keep my eyes shut. I'm making an appointment tomorrow but my anxiety is through the roof over this! 
Conjunctivitis,Different color spot on eye,"My daughter has a spot on her eye that has progressively gotten lighter in the past 6 months. She’s had it for about a year. She has brown eyes and this spot is light brown, almost green. Is it typical for only a part of your eye to change color? She is 5 years old. I’ve taken her to 2 pediatricians. They are not concerned but I still worry about it. Any insight you can provide, I would greatly appreciate."
Conjunctivitis,Double vision anyone? ,"Hey guys, I'm 25 in the UK, I started having double vision around two weeks ago. If I cover either of my eyes one at a time, then I can see straight. I went to the opticians because I thought that I might need glasses, but I have 20/20 vision, but she saw blurred optic disks so referred me to the hospital. There I had scans on my eyes, had them dilated, field tests, and the doctor came said he can't see anything wrong, although he said there was a tiny swelling on my left optic nerve but he stressed that it was nothing to worry about - no brain tumour or palsy etc. So I was referred back to my doctors where I had blood tests - they were the general blood work, and I also pushed for a lymes disease test which hasn't come back yet. I read stories online here in the UK regarding lymes, and the tests coming back false negative, which I'm worried about. Ive been referred for a Head and orbit mri in a couple of weeks, but I'm moving next Wednesday so will have to ring and see if my new area can book me in. Here are some other symptoms I've been having - Double visionAwful headaches for a month, and 4 days of amped up pain prompted me to go for the eye test at the opticians. Whoosh Whoosh in my ears, tinnitus? Neck pain and stiffness, where the headache usually originates from. Pain under my earlobe near my jaw, sometimes pain all down my right side of my face over the temple/ear area (not cheek or nose etc) And that's about it so far. Ive always had problems with my beck hurting, tense neck muscles, or when im standing for too long it hurts. Could I have spinal fluid leaking? Or a herniated disk pressing on my optical nerve? Would the eye doctor have been able to see any pinching when he scanned/looked at my eyes? And should I mention when I call to change my mri appointment about my neck, and possibly get them to scan the top part of my neck? I don't know why they didn't think it was an issue when I told them that the headaches were originating from my neck, surely they would have thought okay let's do the head mri and the neck too, or even the whole spine incase there's something lurking around there. This whole double vision thing has really thrown my life off track, it's very hard to cope with it - I can't go out because it just gets too much to see, and I can't watch TV or read properly - very stressful, and it doesn't seem to be getting any better. Really have taken my vision for granted. I'm young and haven't had any serious medical issues before, I've got so many plans for my future but now it seems to be ruined by my vision, what if I never see straight again? The thought scares me, and although I'm grateful for nothing major coming up on my tests yet, having no diagnosis and treatment plan is pretty stressful also. Would love to hear some experiences of you guys with similar symptoms, if you got better, or what you were diagnosed with! Thanks for reading and your replies! "

Conjunctivitis,Choroidal Nevus (eye freckle) HELP!,"Hi Everyone,I've been going to the doctors since around January for some strange head symptoms. I work in a theatre and really struggle with the flashing lights and noise! I get these really intense fuzzy head feelings like my head is paralysed and extremely tight. I also get what i call a 'light hangover' where if I've watched a show with strobe lighting i feel so ill, drained and tired for days after and have a constant headache.Recently i went for an eye test - suggested by my doctor and they found a eye freckle in both eyes, and the 'pigment' on it was a concern so i was referred to an eye specialist at my local hospital. This led to nothing, she basically told me to train my brain to ignore the symptoms and go back to my GP as my eyes were healthy, no mention about the pigment. I have constant eye floaters 24/7 and its not just one or two its around 10, all different shapes colours and sizes. I also have a static glaze over my vision constantly like everything is flashing. I just getting fed up of doctors not really listening to me and just wanting some advice on what it can maybe be or what to do? I've attached some pictures of my most recent eye scans so you can see my eye freckle. Really grateful to anyone who can help me out"
Conjunctivitis,Ongoing problems 2 years after lens replacement surgery,"Hi.. i had lens replacement surgery 2 years ago in Thailand and am still experiencing some major problems. I am originally from the UK but have lived in Thailand for the past 29 years. I am now 49 years old and had the surgery May 2017. My eye sight was always quite good but started to get worse as i turned 40 years of age. Anyway i decided to look in to surgery as my short vision was bad and i needed glasses for reading. I did my homework on the best eye surgeons in Thailand and booked the operation with a doctor that was regarded among the best in Thailand. I paid top dollar for the operation and was assured that all was going to be fine. The doctor operated on both eyes on the same day which, i have since found out is not common practice. I was put to sleep for the op as i was quite nervous about them poking around in my eyes whilst being conscious. As soon as i woke it didn't seem correct. It took a whole night sleep for me to awake and to be able to open my eyes and try to focus. I had my 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 month, 6 month and 1 year check up's, and some other check up's in between and at every appointment i voiced my concerns that the problems i disgusted at every appointment were not clearing up. I decided to get a second opinion from the best eye hospital in Bangkok to be told that they could not find anything wrong with my eyes and the operation looked perfectly normal. Another few months passed and the problems persisted, i then decided to fly back to the UK and had an appointment with a doctor at Moorfields. Again i was told that they could see nothing wrong with my eyes. Before i had my appointment at Moorefields i made a list of the, sometimes overpowering sensations i was having in my eyes.Feels like there is an eyelash stuck in my eye for days on end which in turn gives me a headache for days on end.The eye sometimes feels sticky when i blinkA cold stinging sensation at the tear ductMuscle spasms around the eyeAll of this leaves me, constantly with tired eyes.I'm sorry to go on but here i sit again with a headache, blurred vision and feeling depressed. Is there anyone that has experienced this amount of irritation for this long after lens replacement surgery."
Conjunctivitis,Discomfort sensation around eye socket,"Had this a fair bit recently, eye looks okay but it feels like I have something touching my eye, feel discomfort under and around the eye socket, more of an annoyance, no pressure, eye is not red, sensation moves around the eye socket, feels tight as if someone is touching the area. A little bit sore if I touch the area under the eye,"
Conjunctivitis,uveitis,"I have an app with an eye specialist but i just want to see if anyonr else has the same problem..for over a year now ive had weird things going on with my eyes. my eyes will feel like theyre on fire or it feels like a burning solution was put in them and i cant keep them open, i have to close my eyes tightly to get relief. other times they just feel inflamed and watery without the need to close them. But whenever this happens i look in the mirror and the white part has little red lines all over. Each time the lines have a different pattern. Sometimes the lines are really red and pronounced and are on the corners of the eye or all over. Other times there seems to be a ring of redness around the iris. And then sometimes they just have a general light reddish look. This comes and goes and occurs in the day and at night. ill wake up.to go to thr bathroom and will.see that my eyes are red but without the burning feeling.And sometimes they actually hurt and sting."
Conjunctivitis,My wet macular degeneration dr used a laser and now thinks its old age deterioration...,"**I am seeing doctor that seems to be caring but when I had a problem seeing after a surgery he said he thinks is photoreceptors dying and now I find his use of laser causes damage to the retina by burning receptors ...So why use that method when I am doing ok, at east as well as the eylea shots can do?

Conjunctivitis,Congenital hypertrophy of retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE). Help!,"Hi.I had a routine eye test and my optician referred me to Ophthalmologist for a more detailed eye exam. This was because he could see a lesion on my right eye. (left eye completely fine)My vision has always been really good but now im 43 i do need glasses for reading or close up stuff.When i saw the Ophthalmologist he said it was not a concern but im to go back in 6-8 weeks.I received a copy of the report that has gone to my GP and it says i have a Congenital hypertrophy of retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE) in my right eye. When i googled this it started ringing alarm bells! There is also a minimal retinal haemorrhage at the edge of the CHRPE which he thinks was probably caused by high BP. (this is controlled with medication for last 20 years, dosage was recently increased as it was slightly elevated)Can someone put my mind at rest please. I have read it could have been there since birth and to be honest it was only in the last few years that i've started having my eyes tested as i've never had a problem so maybe its always been there.How common is this and should i be concerned? My health in general is good.Thanks."

Conjunctivitis,Lines when I roll my eye to the side,"Every once in awhile when I quickly roll my right eye to the side I see wispy lines, kinda like a spider web. This has been going on for about 6 months. I'm nearsighted and went to my eye doctor in February for glasses. He did an eye exam, tested me for glaucoma and said my eyes were fine.

Conjunctivitis,Pain developed in eyes and forehead after I thought I was recovering from throwing up,"I'm 19. I'll start from last Thursday. I was a bit nauseous in the early evening but not feeling sick. Later on it worsened a little and I ate my tea around 9 and I didn't feel hungry but I don't know whether it was because I was focusing on something else that was getting my attention. Don't think this info matters.I went to sleep nauseous and kept waking and having negative thoughts, feeling stressed etc. This was until around 5 am when I decided to get a sip of water from the tap and head back to bed. Next minute I'm throwing up everywhere. Food poisoning surely?I only threw up the once and haven't done so since I was around 14.I stayed in bed on Friday with no energy. Saturday I got a migraine and felt low on energy but I tried to push myself. Sunday I tried to return to my usual routine and food consumption. I was a little light headed in the morning but got through it.Then, Sunday night (in the minutes leading up to bedtime) I laid on my bed, just using my phone. I sat up and I get pain in my forehead, it might have been my left eye as well. I thought nothing of it and went to bed.It was there the next day (yesterday) and I noticed it happened in my right eye as well. It hurts when I move my eyes around and sometimes my head. My throat has slight discomfort but not like a typical sore throat.Any ideas? Thank you in advance."

Conjunctivitis,Xen Gel Stent for Glaucoma,"I have been seeing a glaucoma specialist for few years for high IOP. Went to see him 2 days ago and he suggested it's time for surgery since the eye drops are not lowering my eye pressure enough.

I have heard of laser treatment for glaucoma, but not Xen implant."
Conjunctivitis,Eye mystery... 7 years ,"For approximately 7 years now my left eye has been bloodshot with my eye lid continuously swollen. I have been to several optometrist as well as ophthalmologist. About a year and a half ago I was finally referred to a cornea specialist. It was explained to me that this specialist was one of only two in the state of Mississippi. I have seen him several times now and each time he spends approximately 1-2 minutes with me with a student typically watching. He never remembers me and always is in a rush. In addition he always prescribes the same treatment, which i have tried many many times, with no success. He always says I have blepharitis, however most of the students disagree when he leaves the room. I have tried so many things and this is all starting to wear on me. I would consider myself a healthy clean cut young professional 34 years of age. May I also add thay it is and has only ever been in my left eye. Its very embarrassing and also has lately become increasingly sore as well as blurred vision in the eye. I have no clue what to do and have become somewhat of a medical mystery to most of the eye professionals in my area. Im willing to travel in order to find a Dr who will take on my case and help me find a cure and/or reason behind my issue. Please, any and all help and guidance is much appreciated. Thanks."
Conjunctivitis,Double vision for 6 weeks please help!,"Hello,I’m new to this but after I’ve had no help from the GP or A&E and the eye clinic i thought someone else’s experiences will be a great help.I’m 25 years old and 6 weeks ago I started to have blurry vision and wooshing in my right ear and the odd day where I would have a lot of pain behind my right eye, the head pain and the vision problems do not go together where I’d lose vision and then get head pain, my vision issue is more or less constant coming and going.Anyway fast forward a couple of weeks and it’s got significantly worse it’s double vision lasts about 30 seconds and happens quite a lot mainly when I’m getting up and down or moving around. I have had my bloods done they’re all A Okay. The ophthalmologist says I have perfect eyes unremarkable where his words I had everything done there. I do have high blood pressure that can go up and down but the gp don’t seem bothered as it doesn’t stay high.I’ve been booked for a brain scan so I’m waiting on that.But last night I’ve developed a shake/tremor in my head and now my hands only slightly but still very scary.Sorry I’ve babbled on.Thankyou for reading."

Conjunctivitis,"Minor Health Issues especially vision, any advice?","Hello there I been having minor health issues for four years and a little bit more that's also increasing and I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice for me which would be much appreciated!I am 19 years old chinese male and also vegetarian.I've seen the doctors before on separate occasion for separate cases (blood was taken every time) such as for just bladder problem (got told I just had to retrain my bladder) and not very helpful. I've went to see the opticians 2 years about my vision problems thinking it was a prescription issue since my vision problems started around the same time I got a new prescription 4 years ago. Which didn't help so I went to see the opticians again but they couldn't see anything wrong with my eye so they referred me to the hospital which I saw opthamology and orthoptics.The orthoptics basically just had me look through coloured overlay sheets and opthamology just done usual eye test. They said I'll get a further appointment couple of months later which I found out I didn't get one so it was then arranged and I saw a different opthamologist which was quite brief basically an exchange of words of what vision problems I have, done the usual eye test and said it could be because of my short sightedness and nothing can be done. The next appointment was made which was a extremely brief exchange of words which I got is that nothing can be done again although I did get another appointment to look at the retina which is another several of months in between again.I also paid to see a visual stress clinic (they stated in the emails that my vision problems could be visual stress) in between the time seeing the opthamologist thinking it would be a lot better but just looked through colorimeter and colour lens to see what was better and got a blue gray tinted glasses prescribed which didn't really help.My main concern right now is my vision as it is really necessary. I've been scraping by work but I can't really keep going on like this, I feel really incapacitated.2 years I wasn't feeling too well in another country which I think I had a X-ray of head, blood test, spinal tap and EEG.

I am in the process of moving so thought it might be stress related.So i have been using eye drops, taking regular breaks, using computer glasses, sleeping and eating well but i still get eye twitching every day.

Conjunctivitis,"Dry eyes, eye pain and headache for a month","About a month ago I went to get a full eye-exam including glaucoma for visual snow that I had been seeing and had some numbing drops and had my eyes dilated. Had very bright lights in my eyes, and shortly after the visit my nose was runny and had developed a headache (felt pressure behind head and around side of eyes and below eyebrows).My eye doctor was very rude and would force my eye open because I kept blinking when he tried to put the drops in and told me that my eyes were fine. A week later I went back because the veins in my eyes were red and had headaches every night. I asked the doctor why this has occurred after my visit and what type of drops he had used to see if I had any allergies with the drops. The doctor became very defensive and told me that I might be sensitive to the drops and told me my nerve looks a little strange. Unable to trust this doctor I went to the emergency clinic to get a second opinion.At the emergency clinic the doctors could not find out what was wrong with me, I had my blood tested for a rash that was supposedly tinea but am now not sure what it is. And am now currently waiting for bloodtest results.A month later I have very dry eyes and need to take lubricating eye gel drops every night otherwise I develop a headache the next day during nighttime. If I do not go out, my eyes are mildly dry and I cannot look into a computer screen very long but my headaches are not present. During the day I don't go outside as flourescent lights and to a lesser degree sun triggers eye pain (pain is around the eyes) the whole day. I am at a lost what to do as I have gone to many doctors to find some relief but cannot find any answers."

Conjunctivitis,Recurring extensive eye tearing from one eye,"Hello,For a few months I've got recurring eye tearing from right eye (from the outer corner) leading to irritated skin around the corner of the eye and recently even the whole upper and lower eye lid (with effects similar to eczema - itching, burning etc.)I've been to a dermatologist and an optician. The first one just gave me something for the irritated skin and antihistamine pills. The optician just told me I have slightly under-performing meibomian glands, but the severity of those recurring episode couldn't be explain just by that.I'm an otherwise healthy 40yo, I don't use any skin products of shampoos that would create an allergic reaction (doesn't also explain it's just one eye), don't own a cat as well, didn't change eating habits, or environment. There are no signs of parasitic, bacterial or fungal infections (asked both the doctors as well). Doesn't look like any viral condition I've been able to Google."

Conjunctivitis,Eye twitching,hii have been suffering with a twitching eye for about 3-4 weeks it started after a heavy gym session which left me with really bad shoulder and chest pain the next day and really scared me. i went to the dr he did an ecg and said it was ok but im waiting fir a cardiology ap as ge said my blood pressure was low. ever since this happened my eye hasnt stopped twitching.im just wondering if the eye twitch and low blood pressure can be related at all.advice appreciated xxx
Conjunctivitis,Allergies or infection?,"I recently went to a flower field (on Saturday) with my contacts on and had red eyes for a couple hours and it died down.After that, I took off my contacts and took a shower and rubbed my eyes and came out to find both my eyes bloodshot.It also ""swelled"" because when I closed my eyes halfway, I could see the white parts kind of fold(?) over my iris... and I could ""feel"" my eyeballs everytime I blinked.The redness died down after a couple hours, and I slept and woke up with light red eyes that have died down more and more over time/over the days.No extra crusting (than normal), just very very slight red eyes if I touch my eyes and some twitching in one eye.I want to go back to wearing my contacts, but I'm not sure if this happened due to severe allergies (I have allergies but never had them affect my eyes so much) or if I have some kind of infection....Any input appreciated!! Thank you!"
Conjunctivitis,"Got this swelling on the mornings first, now it lasts for hours","Also my nostril is sometimes blocked before or after sleep, and there is no way I can sneeze it out or clean with a wooden stick with a cotton swab. My local ophthalmologist and otorhinolaryngologist said there is nothing to be worried about, but that was about a year ago.I also have a heavy form of acne for 4 years, and I was once diagnosed with demodex, but my treatment with benzyl benzoate and retinoids didn't help it.I am going to local clinic again, but would also appreciate your opinions."
Conjunctivitis,"Discomfort / headache in left eye, searching for answers","Hi all, I'm new here so I apologize if I run afoul of any norms...I'm a 23/yo male experiencing frequent discomfort/strain in my left eye, accompanied by a light headache and/or ""pulling"" or ""tightness"" sensation in my left temple/eyebrow. The discomfort is fairly unpredictable, though I notice it a lot while driving and while in meetings. It is sometimes, but not always, an issue while looking at a computer screen.Some background. I believe I have some binocular vision problems, as my eyes have trouble focusing. When looking at an object, I often can slightly see an overlapping ""ghost image"" to the left of the main image. My left eye is also weaker than my right eye; I very rarely feel any discomfort whatsoever in my right eye. On the whole, both of my eyes, minus the double vision, are quite healthy. My OD is - 1.25 and +1.25, and my OS is -1.25 and +1.25 for single vision glasses. I believe the double vision is uncorrected from when I was young, and that I simply learned to ignore it / forget about it for much of my teenage years.I recently went to an ophthalmologist, who placed prisms in my glasses in an attempt to correct the double vision. It seems to be doing an OK job, because I don't feel like I have to make as much of an effort to focus my eyes; but the images are still not fully in-line, and I'm still experiencing the eye and head discomfort. That said, I've been wearing the new glasses for only about a week, so I am not sure what to expect.While the pain and discomfort is not severe, it's the persistence that bothers me most. It makes it hard to focus while reading or doing email at work. Any thoughts on what I could do to relieve my symptoms? Any help would be appreciated."
Conjunctivitis,I need help because I’m worried about my ma.,"hi everyone i am maria. So i'm really worried about my ma because of her eyes. Back in the day before i was born she got laser eye surgery. Fast forward to now, yesterday my mom went to the eye doctor and she said that theres some scar tissue.

So i need to know, can the scar tissue be removed? and if so what are her best options? thank you for taking the time to read this. if you know anything please please let me know!"
Conjunctivitis,Sudden strange eye symptoms including flashes and floaters. Help!,"Hi, I’m 14 and I’ve been moderately shortsited (-4.5 in the left and -4.75 in the right) for about 5/6 years now. About 3/4 weeks ago we had a thunderstorm with a lot of lighting. I walked into my kitchen which was well lit (this was in the daylight) and saw a sudden white flash in the whole of my vision, almost like somebody had just flashed a bright torch on and off infront of me quickly, I assumed it was lightning. This has happened quite a few times now and for the first probably 7 times it happened I just assumed it was lightning, and continued to assume this until I was sitting in class one day at school about 2/3 weeks ago and saw 2 little dots floating across my vision. I knew they were floaters as I have heared about them before, but I have never had any of these issues with my vision apart from shortsightedness. It worried me instantly, so went home and researched all about them. I am aware they could be harmless but I have a very bad feeling about it, and have seen that if you’re experiencing floaters along with the flashes, there could be something wrong. At first it was occasional small floaters and flashes, but they’ve gotten increasingly and rapidly worse. It’s been sunny lately so we’ve been outside barbecuing and what not, and these floaters just won’t leave me alone! I now see them everywhere, even when looking at peoples faces or reading in places that aren’t even well lit! (although they’re usually more visible when I’m somewhere bright, eg looking at the sky) I continue to see them in all lighting now. And not to mention they’re really big now and I just can’t go a single day without seeing at least 40/50. They can be the strangest shapes too. (Lines/squiggles/swirls/clumps/circles/mounds etc) I’ve had GCSE’s in school these past 2 weeks and can’t concentrate becuase I just see floaters drifting across my paper and the wall. I see strange things too, almost like strange dark shapes just floating around (they’re not floaters), mostly in my prephiral vision. Back to the flashes, once I had researched floaters I noticed that they’re sometimes paired with ‘flashes of light’, this is when I noticed that that is what I was experiencing. Sometimes I will see full vision flashes as previously explained but now, they’re mostly little flashing white or black dots (sometimes the black dots pulsate in my left eye) in my vision. I am experiencing eye pain occasionally. I noticed that for the past 6 months, my eyesight is getting rapidly worse, I know this is normal for teens but I’m talking about seriously rapidly: I recieved new, stronger glasses approximately 5/6 months ago, and just under 2 months later my shortsightedness had gotten even worse by 3 steps!! This is now happening frequently. For about 4 months now, I have suffered with bad night vision, where I walked into my room in the dark one evening and saw that I was seeing more than double of the light on my digital light up clock (the numbers light up). This also got increasingly worse and I now experience severe glare and haloes, and also the triple vision and glare of light constantly, not just in the dark, but even in full daylight. For example, if I look at a street lamp I will see huge white lines coming out of it, or if there are subtitles on a screen I will see multiple of them. I recently went to the optician to explain these glare issues etc (I had not yet experienced the flashes or floaters) who said she wasn’t sure what was wrong, gave me stronger glasses and said to go to the doctor if symptoms persist/get worse. They did! I went to the doctor who didn’t do any tests on my eyes (this was at the stage when I still thought the flashes were lightning, so I only mentioned the glare/ double vision of light) and he just asked me to read something, sat me down and booked me an appointment with the ophthalmologist at the hospital. It is since then my symptoms of floaters and flashes have been revealed and everything is getting worse by the day. I have no idea when my ophthalmologist appointment is and have been waiting for a little while now. I don’t know what to do! It’s really affecting me. Something that’s also happening is I sometimes see a dark shadow/ circle just fly across my vision (not floaters) at any time. They can be white or black, but usually black. I can sometimes see a shower of flashing white dots in my vision and I know that all of this is very abnormal for my age. I can feel that something is wrong, I’m just not sure what!? Does anyone have any ideas/suggestions? Is this serious? Should I try to push for my ophthalmologist appointment? My Grandad has glaucoma, but my optician tested for that and I do not have it. All of these symptoms get worse by the day! As I say, none of this has ever happened before! Everything that appeared, appeared so suddenly, none of it was gradual. P.S- sorry for how long this is!!?Hi, I’m 14 and I’ve been moderately shortsited (-4.5 in the left and -4.75 in the right) for about 5/6 years now.

Conjunctivitis,Dim Vision,Vision goes dim for 10 to 15 seconds. Anyone else had or have this
Conjunctivitis,Poor quality contact lens check? Or do I keep waiting?,"I've worn toric contact lenses (CL) for around 18 years now without a problem. Up until a year ago, I was with Tesco Opticians, which have now been taken over by Vision Express (VE). Under Tesco I never had any concerns, and orders were always in quickly. My first VE order after the takeover took 3 months to arrive.So... I recently had a sight test at another branch (as I was working away), and was told my eyesight had worsened. New glasses... massive improvement. Left eye Cyl has changed by -0.50, and right eye by -1.25. No complaints.Now, back home, having waited over a month for the first available CL check appointment at my local VE store. It's an optician I've never seen before, but who instantly gets flustered spending the first 15 mins of the appointment searching disorganised boxed of trial lens orders for some trial lenses ordered in. That seemed strange to start with, since I had mentioned I thought a prescription change in the lenses was needed, so ordering in a different brand of lenses at the same spec seemed pointless...Anyway, no sign of the trial lenses. A quick check (look ahead, look up, look left, look right, blink) on each eye, and I'm asked to read the lowest line on the screen, one eye at a time. Left eye not amazing, right eye worse. This kind of makes sense, given the glasses prescription.He offers a pair of lenses in front and asks me to look down at a card. It's slightly clearer with. ""That's excellent"" he exclaims. ""There's been a +0.5 improvement in both eyes. It's what we're aiming for."" No further tests with lens options, no reading of the screen again. And for the first time ever, no taking out my contact lenses for a check of the health of the surface of my eye.I question the fact that the numbers from the sight test and CL check seem to contradict each other. As I'm lead out back out, he explains that the contact lenses are closer to my eyes, so need a weaker prescription. That's always been the case (CL prescription has always been weaker than my glasses), but why on earth would they start going in opposite directions??!I now have another month wait for the next available CL check, for a fit of some trial lenses that are now a weaker prescription than I currently wear. I'm noticing I'm struggling wearing my old CL prescription, but the whole appointment felt very disorganised and a cursory look at how healthy my eyes are. I've no concerns, but know that CL suppliers are really keen on you having your eyes checked annually if you wear lenses.Have the recommended checks on contact lenses been relaxed since Dec 2017? Or have I just ended up with an optometrist who was in a rush to get home that evening? I'm not claiming to understand the numbers, but I've never know my prescriptions to start changing in opposite directions. I've no chance of a second opinion any time soon at that store (their appointment availability is ridiculous), but I live on the Isle of Wight, so there's not a huge choice of branches without getting a ferry!?Sorry for the long post..."
Conjunctivitis,Is it Glaucoma? ,"Hi, I am 36 years old and last year did the OCT scan where my vertical C/D ratio was 0.68 and 0.67 and when I did one today after 6 months it was 0.68 and 0.69. So an increase of 0.02 in the left eye. Does this mean I have glaucoma?Also the RNFL Symmetry has reduced from 92% to 91%.GCL + IPL thickness was 90 and 90 last year with this year going down to 88 and 89.Visual field test was fine, but could this be early glaucoma?I had high eye pressure last year as I got really stressed out to about 20 but when I went to a specialist it read only as 12/14 and then with dilation 16/16 so she said no eye pressure. But to check the scan again in 6 months to check if there are changes.Now that I have done the test I am kinda freaking out as there are changes.Anyone here knows if there is any error rate in the machines? Or is it glaucoma for sure?Please give me some information to process as I am going nutts.ThanksMay"
Conjunctivitis,Lost peripheral vision for 30 mins,"Hi,Today I went through some really horrible experience. I suddenly lost my peripheral vision for around 30 mins. Since I woke this morning, I had headache. Later in the afternoon around 2, I suddenly found that things are vanishing in my vision to the right side of my eye. I closed each eye separately and begin evaluating where the blind spots are. It were both in the upper-right side. For the whole time, in my blind spot, I saw a vibration , I could even see it when my eyes were closed.What was this? Has anyone else expericed this? Is this migraine ?"
Conjunctivitis,Scared that i will become blind,"Hi, so i am 14 years old and my vision is at -4.25 currently and i'm afraid i'll become blind the last time i went to the doctor was during January. But the doctor said that my prescription did not change that much. But when i was playing a game the text seemed a little blurry and i was super worried. But i can read normal small text fine even farther away from my computer screen. I'm just super worried when i get older i will become blind"
Conjunctivitis,How do i know if my contact lenses is still in my eyes?,"Hi, i have been wearing contact lenses in over 2 months now and yesterday i had some problems knowing if my contact lenses was still in. I am pretty good in seeing whether they are still there, but still i am not sure. It looks like my eyes has a natural blue tint around my iris, so i am a little bit confused.I tried to apply some rewetting drops and also massaging my eyelid to see if the lenses would dislodge. I tried to also examine my eyes thoroughly in the mirror to check if it was there. Someone also told me that you can use your glasses to know if they are still on your eyes, but i could see fine with my glasses.Have anyone of you guys experienced anything similar? Do you have some good tricks? I will be thankful for all the replies."

Conjunctivitis,Can too much gaming caused retinal detachment?,"Hi guys, i'm a programmer and i spend my time on the screen. I have floaters and i have astigmatism. Recently i got a new glasses and my astigmatism went up. Both eyes are at 300 for astigmatism. My optician just mentioned about astigmatism and nothing else.

Conjunctivitis,Macular pucker and different sized images in eyes. Do you drive?,"I've had an epiretinal membrane or macular pucker in my right eye for about 5 years now. This has led to different sized images in my eyes - the image in my right eye is much larger than that in my left eye. This has affected my binocular vision and I have difficulty reading, particularly anything at a distance, occasional dizziness and poor depth perception. I haven't driven for many years, but would be interested to know if anyone else has this problem and if they feel safe driving. As a car passenger I know that I cannot read road signs until I am very close to them."
Conjunctivitis,Overexposed vision,"I posted this in the migraine forum but i don't know if that is the case. I try to post it here as well to see i somebody recognize the symptoms:I've been having these strange vision problems since 2016. Doctors have checked my brain and my eyes but hasn't found anything. It started with the typical retinal migraine symptoms with zigzag flashing lines. but the last year, vision just becomes brighter and unfocused. It only last a couple of minutes and it comes without a warning. It's only my left eye thats affected. It usually happens monthly. Does anyone recognize this? I've tried to make an image in photoshop of what it looks like. Sometimes the lights shimmer."

Conjunctivitis,Eye issues going on a couple of weeks and feeling discouraged ,"Hi to all,I have been having an eye issue for awhile now that i am feeling discouraged over. it first started out as it hurting to blink and some throbbing pain. i had a spot near my tear duct that was puffy looking so I figured it was a stye and applied a hot compress for awhile. The pain stayed about the same for awhile, but then it started to increase in severity. I have been to my regular eye doctor three times now and I got told my eyes themselves are fine and look healthy. There was some mild inflammation underneath my eyelid though so the doctor said this might be from allergies as my tear ducts have also been quite itchy. So, he suggested some allergy eye drops which have helped.The pain has stayed though so I decided to go get a second opinion from another eye dr in my city. Well, good news is that my eyes are healthy. The moment she saw me though, she said my eyelid looks puffy. Well, when she was doing the exam, she saw a blocked duct along my lashes and a white head. So, it seems to be a stye. I have been given a hot compress eye mask to use and I have to get a topical cream that is supposed to help.I have been noticing a semi new symptom though. I told her about it and she said it is possible with a stye. I have had some light sensitivity. It is mild, but annoying. It makes me paranoidas its in both of my eyes. I am not sure if it could be due to eye strain, but I cant help, but think of the worst. I sometimes will wake up with wetness under my right eye too.I am just wondering then if any of this sounds normal with a stye and if anyone has had light sensitivity with a stye or eye strain."
Conjunctivitis,Eye concerns due to toxic vapours in eyes.,"06 months ago i got lithium ion battery fumes in my eyes.

Now i have flashing lights and sometimes see straight lines as slightly distorted, i also see light trails.

Conjunctivitis,A sore eye for almost a week now after looking at the sun?,"Hi all, I have had a sore eye now for almost a week after looking at the Sun. I know I am an idiot for doing so and I didn't look at it long at all (like 2 seconds) but it feels like ever since then, my eye feels sore on the side next to my eyelid. I feel like the vision has gone slightly blurry, but I may be imagining that. I have very bad eyes anyway with Nystagmus and occular albinism. I have tried eye drops and it feels sore mostly when I am tired, when I blink and if I am looking in a certain direction. Should I go to the Doctor about it or wait it out some more? There is no discharge or anything, just a sore, gritty feeling at the side of my eye. Thanks"

Conjunctivitis,Nevi from poke in eye? ,"Hi,I had an eye test done today and was advised I have a Nevi at the back of my right eye, which wasn't mentioned a couple of weeks ago (at another eye test - got a second test done at a different shop as my work pays for free glasses from this other shop!). It also wasn't mentioned at my last test which was around 8 years ago.Anyway, yesterday I got poked in the eye quite hard my a piece of cardboard via my Son, as an accident. It hurt at the time, and is still slightly sore today.I forgot to mention this to the person who conducted my eye test, but as it is in the same eye which she mentioned there is a nevi, I was wondering if it could just be down to this accident yesterday?Is this possible?"
Conjunctivitis,Eye problems,I have been a patient of early Glaucoma and early dry AMD and has been getting treatment for these for the last over 3 years.

Conjunctivitis,I am considering multifocal lens implants and want to know about night visual changes,"I am 58, wear multifocal glasses but am very active playing sports (indoor soccer, squash, beach volley ball, cycling) and was wondering if people have had any experience with these activities after having replacement multifocal lens surgery.I am quite motivated to be independant from my glasses, especially for my sporting activities.I am aware that the nature of multifocal lenses will give halos around lights at night as a side effect, but what is it like driving a car at night, and watching movies both at the cinema and on your computer?Thank you for your advice"
Conjunctivitis,corrective eye surgery,"I have age related presbyopia, ie my lenses are becoming less flexible and my near vision is thus poor. Until this started happening a couple of years ago I had near perfect vision. My optician has also advised me I have very early onset cataracts - which was a bit of a shock but he said that it would be some time before they caused any bother or needed anything doing. I have difficulty with getting glasses to suit as my long distance is only slightly affected but my near vision needs help. Single vision or reading glasses are great for counteracting this but I'm continually having to put them on and take them off as I cant see to walk around with them on but cant read anything without them. I tried varifocals but the lack of lens space given to the near vision bit at the bottom really isnt sufficient to be comfortable. Is there any procedure like Lasik or similar that can help correct this type of vision loss or are laser techniques only suitable for corneal problems. Best advice to everyone - dont get old ? it's no fun."

Conjunctivitis,Recurring eye infection ,"since October i have been getting eye infections. my eyes are always watery and i usually have discharge at night. i have seen two doctors and 4 optometrist and they all have prescribed me loads of antibiotics and medication for allergies. none of those worked... in December a doctor told me to stop all my meds for my eyes and 24 hourslater i had twice the amount of discharge i usually have , had red and burning skin on my face, hives and i was tachycardic, i went to the hospital and they gave me more meds... my eyes still havent improved since, they went back to how they were before: watery and discharge at night. no one knows what to do and its starting to be really hard for my moral because i dont think i can live in constant eye pain."
Conjunctivitis,Deep Pain in Eyes From PC + Referred Nerve Pain - Need Help!,"HiThis is an unusual post and I'm sure not many people can relate to this, but I am desperate for any kind of answer after having gone to 2 ophthalmologists, 2 neurologists, MRI and blood tests.I have this problem where, when I look at different types of computer screens I develope very bad pain behind my eyes (feels like deep pain in the optic nerve or behind the eye) - this then causes a ripple effect of referral pain to my occipital nerves at the back of my head (flares up) and to the nerves on top of my scalp and just above my ears. This is accompanied by deep deadaches and stiff jawline as well that basically puts me into a state of psychoses where I become unable to think, am affected cognitively, am moody, aggressive, and become almost out of my mind because of the pain and strain all over my head and behind the eyes - I cannot even sleep because of the pain/strain. It last for many days and is triggered by computer screens and ANY type of gaming - watching gameplay videos etc. Glasses have had little effect after trying many. My whole face goes deep pale white and I get halo grey rings around my eyes - I look like a damn cancer patient.This problem has deeply affected my life, health wise and employment wise and no doctors understand anything about it. I will mention that I have been on SSRI and antidepressant medications in the past and it has become much worse since I came off those meds."
Conjunctivitis,PLEASE help me ;-;,"I have been having anxiety with my vision as i started seeing trails and afterimages ever since i had a serious 3 weeks headache and eye strain few months ago. Ever since it stopped,i gained vision problems ? at first i was obsessed with my floaters,and after the headache came and went,i was obsessed with afterimages then i googled about it and found out about palinopsia/hppd/visual snow/blue entopthic vision and so on which scared me with all the posibilities I found. I then suddenly started seeing trails and then positive afterimages which im convinced i have palinopsia and now,i am obssessed with my mild static vision (which now i dont care about my trails and afterimages) I dont think its visual snow cuz visual snow you'll see white and black dots all over ur vision 24/7 or even colored ones. On my case,i see vibrating dots? that seem like static in a way? Its like very mild at first but it went away during my time obsessing over my afterimages and trails,it came back recently when i stopped obsessing over it and now its stronger than ever as i somehow see it when i sleep and at daylight UNLESS i focus VERY hard or im very busy,then i barely notice it. Please help me? I cant see the doc cuz my parents wont believe me as i tend to obssess over small things until i developed anxiety ? Is it really all anxiety? I really want my old vision back where i dont get bothered by it. I cry everyday knowing it wont get better or i might even go blind or something. I dont wanna live on like this. Please help me. (btw i also see very tiny dots like clusters when i look at a bright screen but it happens rarely) before all this happened i obsessed over my tinnitus for about a year too until it went away/become very silent."
Conjunctivitis,Storing Lucentis safely,"I had stored Lucentis eye injection in the fridge at about 0 to 0,5 degrees Celsius before I realized the temperature wasn't above 2 degrees as it should. Is the medicine still safe to use? I am very concerned ?"
Conjunctivitis,My eye is twitching uncontrollably.,"A couple weeks ago, I was playing volleyball and I was hit squarely in the eye by one. The day after, my left eye began twitching uncontrollably in random intervals throughout the day, but it mostly occurs in the evening and happens after I blink. I've never had eye spasms before that incident, so I think my eye twitching and being hit are correlated. Should I be worried?"

Conjunctivitis,Pain Controlling ,I am scheduling appointment tomorrow for my first appointment with pain management and I have never gone to one of these before can anyone tell what will happen during my first visit just so I know what to exapect? How long is the visit? My surgeon said he’s only allowed to write a certain amount of scripts and I’m at the limit so I have to be referred he said he knows I need the medication so I need to go to pain management. My surgeon is only allowed to write for tramadol or Tylenol 3 and tramadol knocks me out so he switched me to the Tylenol and that barely does anything for the pain so I hate pain meds but I’m at the point that I need something stronger does anyone with ruptured disc know what type of medication they will give for that? Thanks in advance and for listening to me I’m just nervous about this first visit since it’s all a new experience.
Conjunctivitis,Weak eyes,"HI starting to feel my eyes are weak when I wake up in the night, and mornings, like struggerling to open them, with sort of flashing silver lines there ?"
Conjunctivitis,Spasm in eye,"been experiencing spasms in one eye above eyelid, not the eyelid itself but the eye cover I'd guess. they happen irregularly. for a few days now .not painful."
Conjunctivitis,My vision got distorted since yesterday,"So I have myopia of different degrees (Right eye: -3.5, left eye: -5.0) and wear glasses. Also I often have eye strain which can make my eye muscles hurt when turning the eyes, and so on.But yesterday evening, I was clipping my toenails and was bent down with my head for a few minutes. After I had finished and stood up, I noticed something odd about my vision. It seemed like my eyes were unable to focus, even as if they weren’t aligned properly.I had hoped this would go away once I give them some rest at night, but when I woke up, the problem persisted. My vision is ok in the center of the glasses, but feels uncomfortable once I turn my eyes upwards or sideward, also I only feel uncomfortable when looking with both eyes. If I cover one of the eyes, I can see fine.I can describe the feeling as being similar to when you get new, stronger glasses and have a kind of distorted vision at first until you get used to your new glasses. Which is weird, because I’ve had my current glasses for 2 years and I’m already well used to them.Another instance where I get this effect is when putting in contacts. The vision is distorted at first, and then I get used to it. After I take them out in the evening and put on my glasses, the vision is distorted again, but the distortion goes away after a good night’s sleep.Since this started after I had my head bent down, I guess it could be the cause? Did I put too much pressure on my eyes and now the muscles are strained? Or could it be a blood flow thing?Thanks for your replies in advance."
Conjunctivitis,"Bad eyesight, feeling of pressure behind the left eye.","Hello,Let me explain the problem. I've been wearing glasses ever since I was 6, being 19 now and turning 20 in a week, my eyesight has gradually been worsening to the point that I have -7D on both eyes. After a checkup, I was told that the cataract I had in my eye since birth couldn't affect my eyesight in anyway, and that everything else, including my eye pressure was fine.Until a week ago. I started having this continuous feeling that something is pressuring in my left eye, accompagned by my vision having been getting a little bit worse. I do not know if I should be concerned or not about this."
Conjunctivitis,Extremely small optic cups and loop in left eye?,"Hello, i was wondering if anyone could explain a few things to me as I'm slightly confused.I had an appointment yesterday with a consultant Neuro opthalmologist. I have been experiencing horrendous problems with my vision. mostly my peripheral vision which is absent but I also experience episodes, 8 now in total by which I have lost my vision temporarily. as you can imagine it's absolutely terrifying. After many tests the consultant said that my eyes were in fact fine but the wiring in the brain wasn't quite right hence the problem with my vision loss. She said that my scans revealed I had extremely small cups which were almost non existent and that I had a loop in my left eye. I was told I was high risk for aortic ischemic optic neuropathy. can someone please explain to me what this means exactly. I have no idea and felt to embarrassed to ask her. I have been referred for an MRI scan and she has also ordered some creatinine blood tests to check kidney function. She did mention that high blood pressure could cause the blood vessels behind the eyes to constrict but again I'm not sure what this means. My eyes are actually quite healthy which is great, she said initially she believed it was a functional not anatomical problem. She then put in some eye drops which even after two attempts did not dilate my eyes even slightly and then said about the cup size and that she had observed s loop. I have no understanding as to what any of this means. Could someone please explain these terms and offer any advice if youve had a similar experience or diagnosis. Thank you."
Conjunctivitis,choroidal melanoma,hiimy wife 36 years old used to complain of weak vision to near object from her left eye since long time. recently she started to see an area of blurred vision when using left eye only together with difficulty in reading and using her cell phone. 2 days ago we went to ophthalmologist who did examine her eye and said that she had a lesion in her retina near to the macula (center of vision) and he did another eye scan called oct then he refferred us to vitro-retinal surgeon as he suspected eye cancer MELANOMA.I AM SO MUCH WORRIED SINCE THENanyone had such experience and is it common in that age..she is realy young for thisthanks in advance
Conjunctivitis,Eyes have a delay to focus when head moves quickly,"Hello, I have noticed in the past couple months that my eyes take longer to move/focus when my head is moving quickly. It is most noticeable when driving: If i look up at a traffic light and quickly move my head down to look in my lap, my eyes take .5 seconds to a second to ""catch up"" and focus at what i want to look at.For reference, I'm a 37 year old man who does not wear glasses, has 20/20 vision, and can read a line or two below the line im supposed to read on an eye test (last checked a year ago). I also have taken lithium for bipolar disorder for 10 years. I mention because i know it can affect horizontal nystagmus gaze. this moving phenomenon is new to me though.I thank you for any input or insight."
Conjunctivitis,Could anyone shed any light.. eye problems..,"I have been suffering with consistant daily symptoms for 2 years of my left eye flashing, and the corner farthest away from my nose getting really sore and almost tight like its being stretched then almost as if my magic the symtoms will disappear and i will then get a really bad painful right eye , just pain no other symptoms but its almost unbearable. Then after a few days it will switch back to the left and it will start over.I do get pain in my teeth and my shoulder sometimes also and occasionally the pain makes me feel sick, i have seen a neurologist, ent specialist and have had an mri scan that came back clear im currently waiting for a ct scan appointment."
Conjunctivitis,Ortho-K lenses pain,"Hi! I got my lenses like 2 months ago and my eye's still hurt when I put them in. I know that putting something foreign in your eye will feel uncomfortable but I only occasionally have these times when it really hurts when I put them in. This pain forces me to squint so I can't sleep in them or it will be too painful. I'm just wondering, why is this occurring and should I just suck it up and leave my contact in my eye while I sleep even when it is painful? I hope I don't sound like a cry-baby. I do spend my day mostly on screens so is this the problem? I also have dry eye syndrome which I am curing with eye drops."

Conjunctivitis,Retinal tear,"Back in April 2018 I an emergency vitrectomy on my left eye (detached retina came on suddenly). Successful surgery, but a cataract formed and will be removed in January. I've been so hopeful about the possibility of seeing clearly again (with glasses)! But, pow!, yesterday I had emergency treatment for a retinal tear in my ""good"" right eye. The retinal specialist used a laser to form scar tissue around the tear. He said it was a large one even though the appointment started with the words ""a small one."" It was a long procedure and unpleasant procedure (I had heard laser repair is easy) and I left feeling out of sorts with blurry vision, a red goopy eye, and an appointment for a check-up in one week. This morning the soreness and swelling is down but I still see a large floater (the one that led me to have my eye checked). I'm being treated at one of the nation's leading eye care centers too. I guess my question is, at the age of 63, is this my new normal? Will I now always have compromised sight and have to worry about tears and detachments? In other words, all the fixing they're doing doesn't really mean my sight will be fixed? I'm grateful for not going blind, but this is all so overwhelming and I feel sick and hopeless. So... my question? Is this my new normal? And how do I know when there's a tear or a detachment if I've got large floaters still? And how do I get back my hope again? ?"
Conjunctivitis,Retinal Detachment Surgery Recovery,"Hello: Last Wednesday, I had retinal detachment surgery under general anesthesia. A scleral buckle was part of the procedure. In 2012, I had retinal detacment surgery in the other eye that was under local anesthesia and didn't include the scleral buckle. It is a week on, and my eye is still swollen, blood red and painful. I wake up with my eye sticking shut from discharge. It feels like this recovery is longer and that not much progress has been made. Of course, I have the gas bubble and can see very little out of the affected eye. Has anyone had a similar experience? Should I be further along at this point?"

Conjunctivitis,Eye infection - Doctor or Ophthalmologist?,"I've had an eye infection for about 5 weeks. My left eye has fluid building up as shown in the picture. In the morning there is small amount of white puss in the corner of the eye. The eyelid also feels itchy.If I'm sitting upright, there's nothing irritating in the eye. But if I lay down, it feels like there's something near the edge of my eyelid but I can't see anything with a magnifying glass.For the last two weeks I've been applying 3 Polysporin drops a day ( one ml contains 10,000 units polymyxin B and 0.025 mg gramicidin) . The infection does not seem to be getting better.Are there any natural remedies I should try?Should I see my GP about this or ophthalmologist.Many thanks"
Conjunctivitis,Irritated eye. Not dry eye syndrome?,"For the past 2 weeks I'm pretty sure, I've had an irritated eye. I roll my eye and it feels like there is an object in the top left corner of my left eye. After i roll that eye, i continue to feel something. I have tried to flush out my eye and no luck. Eyedrops, no luck. Any ideas what this may be? I don't want to visit my optometrist for no reason but i will if i have a serious condition. I do have contact lenses but I broke the left one before this occurred. Note: I do not have problems with my right eye and in my left eye, it is partially red but that is the same as the right one.Thanks if you can answer this!?"
Conjunctivitis,"Had my left eye lasered, now the right is blurry.",I had a secondary cataract on my lens. It was lasered yesterday and the result was terrific. But now my right eye which seemed to be fine is blurry. I can still see much better than I did before I had the laser done.
Conjunctivitis,Right Eye problems. Plus other issues,"hello everyone. Im trying to find out if anyone knows what is happening with me. I keep getting symptoms on the right side of my body. Dry eye, brain fog, dry sinus head pressure, pressure behind ear, tinnitus. all this is happening on my right side. If anyone knows what it could be please help."
Conjunctivitis,Hit my eye really hard,"Yesterday I hit my eye really hard on accident. I pulled the string on a retractable device and it hit me right in my eye. It was like a freak accident. at first I felt like I was going to pass out and my vision automatically blurred. I had to sit for a couple minutes until I felt I could see. Its been about 20 hours, my vision is a lot better, but I still have a small blurred spot, not as worse as before. i also have a black eye from getting hit by the stupid thing, so my eye is a little swollen and tender. i believe this is a corneal abrasion, as my damaged eye is very sensitive to light still.i am currently out of the country until the next 4-5 days and don't have access to insurance here. Will this injury be ok if untreated for 5 days?"
Conjunctivitis,Am I overacting / what is this? ,"hi there i'm 19 and when i was younger i suffered from migrane with auras and nausea. i had one in March 2017 and had none until October 2018. I Had an aura that started off as like a light/ blindspot that got bigger and went away within 25 mins. The next day i felt nauseous. However a couple of weeks after this I had a short bout of double vision that lasted a minute - it was frightening and two days later i went to the optician and he checked my eye muscles backs of the eyes eg and said there was nothing wrong and that it was due to blood being pumped around the body(too slowly) like when you stand up to quick. But two weeks ago i had another aura that again went away within 25 mins and i felt sick after but that was more or less it. But ever since this, i have felt weird. A few days after this i kept feeling like i was going to experience a blindspot but never did. My left arm has felt disconnected on and off but not numb. And now my corner of my left eye feels weird like as if I cant fully see out of it but I can. - now when i take my glasses off and close my right eye, my left eye is a bit blurry. I'm longsighted. I have booked an appt with my GP but it's in over a months time. I dont want to go back to my optician because it'll most likely be nothing serious but I'm scared it is. I can't sleep and my dad even says I'm not myself. So let's get this short lol even though I'm NOT experiencing an aura it feels like there's something 'left' from the aura. I have a terrible fear of going blind and this doesn't help. Sorry for the long post -any advice? Is this something you have experienced?Thanks"
Conjunctivitis,Is this beginning of Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)? ,"Could anyone with AMD tell me if this happened to them before they were diagnosed with AMD?When I wake in the morning and the bedroom is dimly light, when I look at the white walls, I can see two small blackish fuzzish round dots in the central vision of both eyes. They are not floaters as I have them in one eye. They are fixed position in each eye and move in sync with each other when I look aboutAs the sun rises and the room lightens up the two dots fade away. At fully lite room, or any where, the dots can't be seen. I believe they (the cause) are still there, just the brightness of the light washes them out. Went to an Ophthalmologist and he examined my eyes and said my nerves are in great shape. He said it's not my eyes, but in my brain, possibly from a mini-stroke. That my be true as I asked my PCP last visit if the right side of my face looks like I had a stroke. Never seen it look like it did. But just in case not, has anyone with AMD had this small blackish spot as a precursor to their AMD? Or had this that lead to some other down the road eye condition? Thanks all! Leaning to get a 2nd doctor opinion as I think it's eye related not brain."
Conjunctivitis,Weird spots in vision ,"This first happened about a week ago, and its only happened twice so far but its worrying me. I keep seeing a spot in my left eye when I tilt my head (only when I tilt it left, not right). It’s sort of this dark shadow looking thing, and it’s near the bottom of my line of sight but spreads to about the middle. It’s also now started forming near the top of my line of sight. It doesn’t impede my vision much because I can see through it, but it’s still freaking me out. It’s only happening in my left eye, not my right. And since someone already asked, no, I’m not seeing the edge of my cheek or nose or anything. I can’t really go get my eyes checked for two more weeks, but if it sounds like an emergency I’ll go ASAP."

Conjunctivitis,could light sources from our surrounding hurt / damage / affect our eyes ?,"I don't mean UV / Sunlight that we all know that they will hurt our eyes by common sense.I am living in densely populated city where I could often see strange colored light from unknown sources. They are NOT from advertising windows or storefront or automobiles. They could be from unknown devices. For example, today I saw a pedestrain holding something and pointing it to the upper direction which emits strong green light, I wasn't sure what it was, I turn my eye away quickly, I want to get close to him to see what it was, but he then left quickly.I think I am sometimes overreacting, however, for long we know that LASER could damageour eyes permanently and everyone of us could easily get a pocket LASER legally.I have two questionsShould I worry about colored light from unknown sources in my city? Could those light hurt / damage our eyes or worsen myopia?How to know if light from a source is LASER or not? Does LASER only appear as a form of beam? If the light is not a beam-like, then it's not LASER. Am I correct?If every time I find strange light or strong light, then I look away immediately, could a few seconds of looking at those light be bad enough to do some harm to our eyes?Any other comments, discussion and information are always welcome"
Conjunctivitis,Slightly red eyes.,Hello everyone.My eyes have been slightly dry and gritty. Now there seems to be slight redness in both eyes. You can only see the redness when I look completely right with my left eye and completely left with my right eye. Pictures of both eyes are included? Does the redness look bad?Thanks
Conjunctivitis,Getting Scared,About two weeks ago I was fine. I had been staying up late looking at a computer screen and playing video games and then having to get up early for school for about two weeks straight. Then two weekends ago I started having a heavy eye feeling and then over the course of the weekend I started blinking a lot and sometimes hard. I went to my campus doctor and she said that I have dry eyes. She gave me some eye drops with preservatives and an ointment. That didn't help so two days ago I went to an eye doctor back home. He said that I had dead cells in my eyes from dryness and beginning conjuctivitis. He gave me an antibiotic eye drop with steroids in it and some refresh eye drops and said I should be better in a week. He also said that I need glasses. My eyes burned at first but they don't hurt anymore. The blinking is not as bad in the morning. I have to admit that when I get sick I look stuff online and this time saw that I could have blepharospasm or even a type of brain cancer that makes me blink. I have tried to rationalize that the doctor would have tested for those things if they suspected it. I'm only 18 and just started college this semester. I have major stress and anxiety when it comes to health stuff because I want to keep going to school and I know that if it was cancer that my family couldn't afford treatment and I don't want to put that burden on them. I want to make something of my self. The doctors and my family have told me not to worry about having those things because they wouldn't get this bad over a weekend and me staying up late and looking at screens helps prove dry eyes but I can't stop thinking about it and it's taking over my life. My stress has caused to lose my appetite and I've been given myself headaches and pressure at the top of my head from the stress as well. The blinking has made me not want to do the things I love. I just want to get better so I can go back to living my life. So I feel stuck in this situation right now. Can really dry eyes cause you to blink a lot even it doesn't hurt anymore? Could my need of glasses be contributing to the blinking? Should I be worried about those conditions I mentioned especially cancer? I'm sorry about the long post but I'm afraid and the blinking is so annoying. I just want to go back to loving life. Any responses would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

Conjunctivitis,Chances of a drop of water causing eye infection,"Hello everyoneI went to the hair salon today, and I wore contact lenses. When my hair was being washed, a drop of water landed on my eyelid, and then got into my eye when i opened my eyes. I took my contacts out when I got home, about 3 hours later. However, when I was heading home, to feel pain in my eye. Now, even without contacts in, my eye still feels uncomfortable and a bit painful. I know that I shouldn't let water touch my contacts. I'm wondering if a drop of water can cause an eye infection?"
Conjunctivitis,Dark area in vision- NOT FLOATERS,"Hello. I recently went through a relatively traumatic experience in August. I lost a pet that was very special to me and I lost her in a very bad way. After about a week of severe grief and even more crying, I woke up, went to work and noticed that there was this random dark spot in my peripheral field of vision.This spot is located in the mid to lower left hand corner of vision in my right eye, just inside my vision next to my nose. When I would strain my eyes outward, the spot would grow. When I pull the skin down on my cheekbone, the spot grows larger and looks almost like 5-6 little hills that travel downward in an arc-like fashion. The hills are a thicker black towards the tops of the hills, and fade clearer towards the bottom.Also, the spot grows more distinctive when my eyes stress upward and to the right. When my eyes are relaxed, I don't notice it unless I'm looking up and at a plain background, or I'm straining my eyes outward. The image I see almost reminds me of paint when you add water to it- where the bulk of color spreads in one direction and the rest clears.When I am simply looking around the room as normal, I don't seem to notice the black arc, which again, is dimmer and barely noticeable when I am not straining my eyes (though it is still present). The times I do notice it when my eyes are relaxed and acting as normal, is when I am looking both up and to the upper right. During this scenario, the arc looks like a little sliver of a shadow like a crescent moon.It almost seems as if the spot is dim enough so as I could ignore it in general, but I can't stop thinking about it or testing it. And when I test it, it gets bigger as stated above.After obsessing about this and testing it frequently, I noticed there is an area in the same place in my left eye- though not as prevalent nor widespread. My left eye seems to house only 2-3 hill-like anomalies when I stress my eyes upward and to the left. It has been about a month and a half and seemed to have gotten a smidge dimmer, but definitely not going away.Some days I can ignore it, but mostly it's always in the back of my mind and my obsession to test it resurfaces. It scared me enough, that after a week of it not going away, I scheduled an appt. with an ophthalmologist. He did a full check of my eyes: took pictures, did a thorough exam of the front, middle, and back of my eye and determined that there was nothing wrong. He said my vision was perfectly fine.It isn't fine.For I also have an issue where - in both my eyes - when I am looking up as far as they can or to the far left/right, there is a a little circle that grows the farther I stress my vision in both eyes that turns a different color. In natural light it looks more greenish, and in dimmer, fake light, it looks more blackish. Yet, the specialist found nothing wrong.I am at a loss of what to do. I'm planning to go into my regular MD and have a physical done, tell them the story, and then see what they recommend doing.The stress of this is starting to affect my life in a negative way and I have grown very anxious and panicky about it and other things. I just keep worrying this won't go away or that another strange anomaly will occur and one day my vision is going to be covered in issues and I will have no answers.Has anyone out there ever experienced something like this before? I can't seem to find any single symptom online that relates to this and I have produced a RIDICULOUS amount of research on it. I have sorted through a glossary of every eye issue in the book- and not one matched the description of what I am seeing."

Conjunctivitis,"I've had ghosting vision for a while now,what should I do?","I read somewhere that dry eyes can cause ghosting vision. I've had dry eyes for a long time now. The causes are spending too much time in front of a computer screen and being around smokers. Also,can dry eyes be genetic? My mother has dry eyes too and I'm just wondering if that's also the reason I have dry eyes. (And the ghosting vision gets a little worse when my eyes are more dry than usual.) Oh and I also see mucus in my eyes. It is a little stringy so it could be another symptom of dry eyes."
Conjunctivitis,Eye floaters ,what is the cause of my sudden eye floaters in left eye??? its been like this for 3 months ? they wont go away.. and are super annoying.

Conjunctivitis,Right upper eyelid twitching for about 3 weeks now,"Hello,First post on the site.About 3 weeks ago I noticed my right eyelid would begin twitching somewhat randomly and last anywhere from 5-20 seconds. It seems to happen 20-30 times a day. At first I was hoping it would go away on its own, obviously it hasn't. I did some research pointing to possible causes including fatigue, stress, alcohol, and other more uncommon disorders. All the causes don't seem like a good fit. My sleep is fine 7-8hrs. a night, dont feel stressed etc. (with the exception this eye twitching issue is really starting to p**s me off). And my drinking habits have not changed (3-4 beers in the evening). The twitching seems to be increasing in severity and frequency and I have noticed that if I am tired it does happen a lot more - especially after I yawn. I don't have any trouble seeing or any other eye issues (no glasses etc.)The only thing in my life that has changed in this time frame is that I have stopped using cannabis. I don't know if cannabis use has suppressed a condition I didn't know that I had? Or if it is related at all? It is the only major life change or anything that I can think of that is ""different"" about my life. I am just looking for any possible help prior to seeing a doctor or an optometrist. I am open to answer any questions etc. Thank you for reading and any possible help."
Conjunctivitis,Slight redness in eyes more than 2 months now,"Hello,I have been noticing slight redness in my eyes,a few red nerves from the corners in both my eyes.There are no itching or any vision problems,I have to stare at computer screens for longer periods due to to work.Are these harmful and what should i do further?Adding the pictures of both my eyesThanks"
Conjunctivitis,Eye pigment/freckle gotten darker ,"Hi,File size is too bigFile size is too bigI recently went for a routine eye test and all was normal, he asked me about an eye speck/pigment/freckle on the white of my eye which I had checked 6 months ago indicating whether it had changed or not, my response was simply “I don’t think so” as to be honest I sort of forgot it was there. After leaving I started to become paranoid thinking it has possibly gotten slightly darker or more ‘defined’ - it’s a yellow/greyish colour about 1mm. I took a picture on my iPhone and compared it to an old photo I took 6 months ago and it does look darker although I feel this is inaccurate as the colour/contrast on the photo looks different to the previous one but it’s driving me mad! I’m going back in 2 weeks to have it rechecked but I can’t wait that long haha, I have read that any changes to your eye freckles could be a warning sign of melanoma if you’re not in puberty or pregnant. I’m a 25 year old male with no previous medical issues or historical family eye conditions - just a raging hypercondriact. Haha. This sort of thing absolutely sends me crazy, I wish I could of been more thorough on the initial appointment !!!! Is this sort of think normal ? Surely he would of spotted something on the eye test and arranged for a photo to be taken ? Could it just be a normal thing like when skin freckles slightly change colour ? I am driving myself mad and this 2 weeks is going to feel like 2 years ! Please share your thoughts/advice. Thanks !"
Conjunctivitis,how to fix eye blurry vision?,PLease help me how i can fix eye blurry vision?
Conjunctivitis,Minor ptosis. Treatable? ,My eyelids are obviously uneven but doctors say it's relatively minor and surgery might make it worse. Do you agree? Or should I search for a good surgeon with a high success rate and get surgery?
Conjunctivitis,Please please help me as soon as you see this,"wednesday morning I woke up with my left eye feeling a constant burning sensation, as if it had an eyelash stuck in it, but after trying multiple times it seems as if there is nothing in there (I flushed it with medication then applied some clorsig). That day the eye gave me hell, constantly watering, sensitive to touch, the occasional burning. It's appearance was a few purple and red lines in which the red were BLOOD red and the purple a more lightish shade, this was it on wednesday.Yesterday morning (thursday) my eye had felt so much better in terms of pain, only hurting slightly when i darted my eye to the left without moving my head, except instead of the purple and red small lines it was one big cluster of red lines in the left corner of my left eye, (over the course of the problem the affected area has been half of my left eye, leading me to believe its not conjunctivitis as I thought it covered the whole eye, I may be wrong). Today my eye is no different, this is what it's looked like for the past 2 days."
Conjunctivitis,Stye is causing blurred vision ?,"HelloI got a stye 2 days ago on my upper eye lid. I get them once or twice a year. This time it is causing my one eye to have blurred vision.

Conjunctivitis,Re-appearing eye styes,"Hello,For the last year, I keep having eye styes around both of my eyes and it is bothering me a lot.There seems to be a two - four days period where I don't have them and then one or a few would come back again. In same or similar spots. Having said that, the styes are tiny and can only be seen if closely inspecting. They are annoying and itchy and go away in like 2 days all the time pretty much.I was wondering if it can be associated with tired eyes or lack of essential vitamins or lack of water or the fact my eyelids are not 100% clean at all times....Was wondering if anyone had this happen or has any information on what this condition is or how to treat it? Many Thanks!"

It was started as one scar, then two scars, then three and then getting wider and thicker.

Conjunctivitis,Cornea scar after transplant,"HiIm looking for some advice and for someone who may have had similar problems. I suffered from a corneal abrasion five years ago (sons nail!) and over the last three ish months have been having brief but definately eye pains on waking. Last week I woke up and knew I had an abrasion again with no obvious cause this time. I’ve been seeing the optometrist for a week who kept reassuring me the really blurry vision would clear up but eight days later it’s just as bad despite the eye itself looking better. He looked yesterday and there’s a scar formed straight across the front of the eye which is what I’m looking through. He was very pessimistic that anything can be done for this except possibly a corneal transplant!!! But said this wouldn’t be done as the other eye is fine.when I have the bad eye closed my vision is perfect but with both open the world is blurry again. I feel nauseous, can’t drive and am just terrified this is what I now have to deal with. Has anyone else out there had this and had an improvement?? I’ve had an urgent referral to ophthalmologist which is the day after tomorrow, I’m just so afraid.thanks Rachel"

Conjunctivitis,Mysterious symptoms...,"Hi I was wondering if anyone else has ever experienced any symptoms with their vision and find out that everything is normal after being tested. I was having some strange symptoms that started with seeing these black dots but their not quite like floaters they started as a small cluster that I noticed in the sky on a sunny day. This turned into more of them that I often see a lot all over the walls and then I started getting a lot of after images. I went to the doctors and they sent me to the optician who done a load of tests on my eyes they were thorough because of the symptoms I'd described to them. Including retina scans, dilating my pupils to see in the back of my eye, eye pressure tests, prophery vision tests etc. Everything came back normal. After two weeks my symptoms wouldn't ease so I decided to go back for another test just in case, especially since I was having a new symptom which was flickering in the corner of my eye (as if the light bulb was flickering) and I was getting headaches a lot too. I was getting eye pain as well like burning and a feling like an eyelash was in it. Everything came back normal again (this was a few days ago) although they did say I have dry eyes. But I was told this wasn't the cause of my symptoms only the eye pain. They said they think I'm having migraines but the headache doesn't always happen at the same time as the flickering and the headache doesn't feel bad enough to be a migraine although it's worse and more frequent than my usual headache. I'm also starting to think that the flickering was just the dots moving in the corner of my eye (they move like tv static) It all seems very strange to me and to other people who I explain it to. The thing is I have health anxiety so I go through times where I start to dought what they have told me and think there's something wrong even after loads of intense tests. My question is, has anyone else experienced any visual or eye symptoms but been told that your eyes are healthy by an optician or a doctor? And did it go away? If not feel free to reply to my post anyway of course. Thanks in advance.

Conjunctivitis,Farsightedness,"Hi, I'm asking just out of curiosity.

"
Conjunctivitis,Floaters are not a lot of fun. I hate them . ,I had 2 tears. I woke up with thousand small black dots. I went to my optometrist the next morning and he sent me to a surgeon around 1:00pm. He operated at 7:00am the following day. It was terrible. There was a large black looking fly in the centre of my vision on the right eye. After the weekend I seen him and he examined my eye. He said it will slowly go away. It’s 11/2 years and my eye is just blurry. Like I smudged butter over my glasses. I drive but it’s not great on bright days. I absolutely hate being like this. I’m going to try transitions in January. My other eye is starting to get cob webs this last year. I’m not that old to have this happen.
Conjunctivitis,Double vision... do I need to see a doctor?,"Hi all,So recently I’ve noticed I’ve had some weird vertical double vision. It almost never happens in the morning and it tends to happen later at night, I notice it a lot when looking at white letters with a dark background. For example, in subtitles it looks like there is another faded set of letters above the normal ones. It goes away when I squint, and if I open my eyes wide is when I see it a lot. It not in just one eye as if I close one eye its still in the other and vice versa, and obviously when both eyes are open as well.I wear glasses and always have to get a new perscription every year when I go to the eye doctor. Bad eyes run in the family.Do you think it would be something like a brain tumor, just normal for someone with glasses or eye strain? I do look at my phone and computer a lot, probably 9+ hors a day, whether its school, work or videogames.I’m not sure how long its really been going on, as the circumstances have to be right to see it. I also have a mess of floters which I know is normal for people with astigmatism."

Conjunctivitis,Catract surgery then gallbladder surgery,"I had right eye cataract surgery 5 days ago. Left eye scheduled 3.5 weeks. Prior to the cataract surgery, it was recommended by another surgeon I have gallbladder surgery. He indicated his office would not schedule until I was released from the eye surgeon. I went for my post op cataract follow up the day following surgery. I mentioned to the doctor I would be having gallbladder removed after being released after the next surgery. My driver/caregiver ask how long after the next cataract surgery would he estimate would be the amount of time before the cataract to the gallbladder surgery. The eye doctor said I could have the gallbladder surgery after the last cataract surgery. Does this sound dangerous to anyone? Especially since I would still be on eye drops for appx 3 weeks, would have only been checked the day following surgery. I am terrified of his comment and afraid his approval could cause all kinds of eye problems for me. Anyone have any input on this matter "
Conjunctivitis,Seeing double vision/ ghosting images,"Hi,I've got anxiety I have been told but over the last few days I am seeing like ghost images when I am on the PC and I am wondering if they is to do with anxiety or not.

I did go for an eye test a couple of months back and they said my eyes are fine. My doctor has also checked my eyes and they said I was also fine. I've attached an image as an example that I am getting. My eyes do feel sore and dry all the time and I don't know why.Thanks in advice.-James"

Conjunctivitis,Glare vision problems - Visited multiple doctors.,"I've had bad issues with glare for past 9 months. It was really really bad in beginning because I tried ignoring it and it even appeared 3D. First Opthamologist said I had dry eye and said I need to start taking restasis. It took a long time to get my insurance to cover it.First day, I took it. My conditions dropped from 100%-70%. They didn't appear 3D anymore or massive. I am contributing this to the anti-inflammation properties of restasis but I honestly have 0 idea.Weeks-months later. No changes after initial day. I went to an Optometrist who specialized in dry eye [LIPIVIEW/FLOW/IPL] etc.... I scored a 100 on lipiview. but a bit of evaporative dry eye according to her. I think it was 3 second in 1 eye and 10 in other. She said my glare issues don't make any sense since I don't have any roughness that she normally sees on a patient who would complain about this.My question is where do I go from here? My Opthamologist was very impatient when I asked questions and seemed like she wanted me out the door [only spent maybe 5 mins with her each visit]. Any ideas what could be wrong and or what specialist I should see."

Conjunctivitis,Red sclera and dry eyes,"Over a few weeks my eyes have been extremely uncomfortable and dry. I have tried everything from eye drops, warm compress and so on but nothing seems to work. Over time i have noticed that my left eye has a mild red spot on the right side of my sclera. What really freaks me out is that I've started a few days ago to notice that the affected spot of my sclera has become kinda wiggly. Its hard to explain, when i move my lower eyelid up and down, the sclera starts moving (not much but you see it). This is not the case on my left eye. I am not actually sure if the eyeball itself is supposed to be a little bit loose or simply firm. "

Conjunctivitis,MY eyes have white gunk around the inside and have been red nonstop for about a year help,So my eyes have both been really red since last year starting in like feb. I’d use eye drops and that would help but after awhile they wouldn’t do anything. I went to my eye doctor and told me my eyes were just overreacting to something they came in contact with so then he gave me eye drops to put in once a day. Those did not help so then i went back and he gave me eye drops to use 4 times a day and those eye drops worked amazing but they ran out and ever since my eyes just turn all red all the time at school and at work and at home. 
Conjunctivitis,Eyes started randomly burning ??,"Hello everybody!I went on a vacation to hawaii last week and this was when the eye burning started. during this trip i forgot to bring my glasses as my eyes have strabismus. Once we went into a store in Hawaii, this was the first time my eyes started burning and it felt like something was stuck inside of it. After about 3 minutes it subsided, however the days afterwards my eyes would start burning at random times and random levels of pain. i thought it could be my sunscreen getting in my eyes, but i doubt that is the cause, as i apply it a good distance away from my eyes. Then i thought it was because of the weather in Hawaii, but now that im back in California, it still burns randomly for about 20 seconds. my eyes start to water and my nose sometimes starts getting runny. i dont know if this is allegies or dry eyes or another problem. i did not have this problem before i went to hawaii. Please advise!! any information would be greatly appreciated."

Conjunctivitis,My floaters are driving me insane!,"So I’m a Type 1 Diabetic and obviously go for my yearly exam to make sure my eyes are healthy. I was just there exactly 4 weeks ago and my opthemologist said she didn’t see any changes in my eyes. She asked if I ever saw floaters, bugs, lights, etc. and I said no just because I’ve always seen floaters here and there for as long as I can remember. However, within the past week and a half or so, I feel like I’m seeing them so much more than I used to (mainly when I look at the sky or at a light screen or wall) and I am losing my mind! My vision is 100% besides that, and I don’t have any other scary changes that I’ve read about. I tend to be a hypochondriac and worry about every single thing that happens to me, but I know that with having diabetes, everything should always be considered.Any suggestions as to whether I should just wait and see if my anxiety calms down or see the doctor? I just feel stupid since I was just there and she said everything looks good, but I’d rather be safe than sorry. "
Conjunctivitis,Possible retinitis pigmentosa?,"Good morning, I am 25 years old and had an eye test the other day. The opticians said that my prescription hasn't changed (quite a weak prescription) since my last eye test 2 years ago, from her checking with the light in the eye and a photo of my retinas she said they are completely clear and healthy however I did poorly on the visual field test, my right eye came out really bad, however, my left was ok. The visual field test was the one where you stare at the red dot and say how many white dots you see. I generally don't have any issues with my peripheral vision and have a quite wide range of vision. As my mother has RP they recommended that I go see a specialist to make sure its nothing serious. When I got home I did another visual field test (I know not great) where you stare at a dot and press a button when you see a dot (the one I used to do), I got 99% on that one out of 70 dots on my first go so no problems. I also don't have any issue with my night vision as well.About 7 years ago I did have genetic tests which were inconclusive and the electricity run through my eyes and they said it was very unlikely that I will get it but I should still get regularly checked. It also runs in my family but only on my mum's side and always within the female line aka my mum and grandmother I do have an appointment with a specialist soon but I'm freaking out and getting incredibly anxious because I know how much it ruined my mum's life and me losing the ability to drive or see is career ending. I don't expect anyone to diagnose me over the internet but is there anything I've said that could reassure me that I don't have RP?"
Conjunctivitis,35 and got floaters and I think flashes as I do not know exactly. ,"I have got loads of floaters since two weeks ago. When to a doctor and she dilated the eye and said there was nothing wrong but if persists to come back. Now I feel that when I blink from my right eye, I see a flash. Is that how flashes come?I am not sure. it is only when I blink. Anyone has any experience. I am going through so much lately... this is just one more thing... please let me know what flashes are.

Conjunctivitis,I HATE EYE FLOATERS SO MUCH PANIC! :(((,"I know Ive posted about this a million times I guess this is just an update.I went to the optamolagist and they dialated my eyes, checked my floaters. said there's no tears anywhere at all and I have dry eye.OK, so I look in the mirror and feel like one of my pupils is still bigger than the other. it's been 2 days. so that's making me anxious, ALSO even though the doc said everything looks perfect I STILL find myself STARING into the sky mid convo with someone following my floaters around. THERES SO MANY, I'm only 22. ((( I can't even imagine the rest of my life dealing with them. I KNOW something has to make them less noticeable at least. or take my mind off them. talking about it helps, please reply. anyone. this is making me so depressed. I also have these shadow floaters that are huge and just float across. I notice more when I squint too. i want to stop everyday being so obsessive about them.please please help. and does anyone else have shadow floaters? that are kinda big.anytbing I can do to help my overall eyesight too?"
Conjunctivitis,Itching eye after small incident,"A year ago small drop of oil flew from the pan while cooking right into my eye, ever since there’s been slight itching and burning sensation especially in dry weathers or when the A/C is on, some redness on one side is visible when there’s itching.I saw a doc at that time who gave me some eye cream for 10 days. Would like to know what can be done and why a year on and it feels like it hasn’t fully recovered."
Conjunctivitis,"Blurry vision when i wake up, but improves throughout the day","Hi,over the past few weeks, I have noticed that my vision has not been as good as it was when I was younger (20/20). When I wake in the morning, the vision in both my eyes is blurred..or cloudy . It is worse in my right than my left. It gets better throughout the day. My right eye is also very watery in the mornings.I do have anxiety as I am going through a stressful time in my life. Could this be another physical symptom or something worse..I have done a bit of research, and even though most of it was not serious,I did find that it could be a sign of a brain tumour. This has made my anxiety worse.Anyone have any ideas on what I should do? I might get an appointment to get an eye test done and see what they think it is...Thanks, Jack"
Conjunctivitis,"Does sitting on Screens (TV, Computer, Mobile phone screens etc) leads to spectacles? ","From childhood, people always say that if you spend a lot of time on the computer or digital screens you will lose proper eyesight and will require glasses for correcting your vision. Before 2 years I started using computers vigorously for my academic purpose and within a few months I needed vision correcting glasses (I didn't have any vision/eye problems before) so I have curiosity whether I am wearing glasses because of my time on the computer or some other factor?Does sitting on computers for a long time or use of any screen causes losing eyesight and leads to spectacles or is it just a myth?As we know digitalization is going to increase even more in the future so will the number of people wearing spectacles (vision correcting) also increase? Are there any standard exercises to relax your eye and reduce your chances of needing a vision correcting spectacles or increasing the power even further what you already have? (There are many exercises on the internet but I don't know which to choose)Thank you for your time. "
Conjunctivitis,Problems with varifocals,"I am diabetic type 1 and recent tests suggest my eyes are ""healthy"". This is via optician and also the NHS annual check with the drops (although the nhs test is probably 9 months old).However I have been having trouble with my varifocals such that I end up with headaches that need ibuprofen if I wear them for more than a few hours. These headaches go away fairly quickly if I take them off to read books for example and I do not get headaches if I use single distance lenses for computer use.The opticians ran 3 eyesight tests over about 3 months and tweaked the prescription but in my opinion the tweaks were too small to account for any headaches and indeed they haven't gone away if I use the varifocals.Even though I also have a pair of distance glasses now I really only use these for TV as I feel I need varying focus glasses when out and about.The opticians seem to have run out of options and to be honest don't see why I should have problems with varifocals. To some extent this seems to be confirmed by internet searches where I can't find anyone else with this issue.I was wondering if anyone had any ideas on the problem or could suggest alternatives?

Conjunctivitis,Vision problems since January,"Hello,To provide a full backstory would take a novel... so I will give short storyIn January I started having random panic attacks, this wasn’t caused or triggered by anything they just hit me one day while in a movie theatre. It took months of testing to actually prove I had a panic disorder but we finally started treating early April. Since then I’ve gotten them well kept and have even gone off my anti anxiety meds with no issues. Since all this started I also began having horrible join pain and numbness.. my doc originally thought this could be due to stress on my body but if I’m not longer having panic or anxiety why is it getting worse? Probably the most frustrating part of all of this is my vision. I’m 25 and have had 20/20 vision forever including a recent trip to the eye doctor. They could no see anything wrong with my eyes at all. I wouldn’t say I have full blurry vision but I lose focus really easily and struggle to bring it back. On top of that there seems to always be a slight haze in my vision. It’s almost like looking at an old projection tv that have the black spots over the picture.. I’m not currently on any medication and I’ve been tested for almost everything. My docs new theory is it could be muscle related. I have very painful TMJ and neck tension that started on January as well. But those only hurt sometimes. My vision is always weird. It hasn’t been normal for several months and it’s I’m afraid I could be losing my vision. I went to a neurologist who had put me on a wait list for MS testing however he doesn’t think I have it because I don’t have all the symptoms and their not coming in waves.. He does think I have fibromyalgia but that can’t cause vision issues to this dagree could it? Please some one give me some advice , I’ve tried posting before but haven’t heard back. Does anyone know what could cause this? Thanks for your time. Tim"
Conjunctivitis,Eye problems can hear them move.,"Hi guys I have had problems with eyes for a while, like weird symptoms when I move them I can actually hear them move and they ache a bit, I'm guessing the muscle behind my eyes?

Conjunctivitis,Does anyone have a possible answer for this? Getting worried!,"Hi. I’m 15 and shortsited (-4.75 in both eyes). About 2 months ago now I had a sudden onset of really odd vision problems that are adding up, however, this particular question is about a specific one. After I started experiencing starbursts, haloes, flashes and floaters, I began to notice swirling white dots in the sky, which I later Googled and found to be what’s called “BFEP” (blue field entoptic phenomena). At first, it was only when looking at the sky, but for the past (about) 5 weeks I am starting to see it everywhere! And not only this but the second I look at the sky or any bright background, it’s all over the place. It almost looks quite scary really. There are about 60/70 swirling white dots that move very fast, and the wierdest thing is that it genuinely looks like they really are right in front of me. Does anyone have a possible explanation for this? I know that it is normal to see this occasionally when looking at something bright like the sky, but I have read that it is not to see it anywhere (the ground/ in a room etc) or so frequently (everyday.) Why is this happening!? Does this fit with my other symptoms? I would appreciate any suggestions. Thanks."
Conjunctivitis,Scared because of sudden blurred vision,I’m a 22 year old healthy male and I’ve been anxious over eye issues for a while. Some background info.. I work 9-5 on computers.. come home from 6-10 still on a computer and use my phone for an hour right before I sleep. I know this is the major reason for most of the issues I have. I went to an eye doctor about a month ago and she said my eyes are healthy but I have dry eyes. Yesterday at night before I went to sleep I was on my phone in the dark and suddenly everything went blurry and I had to get up and wash my face. It lasted for a good minute and then things cleared up. I went to sleep and woke up and everything’s clear but I’m scared it just suddenly goes blurry again. Is this related to excessive computer usage?

Conjunctivitis,I've had floaters since primary school and feel that I'm going blind. ,"I’m 17 and have been suffering with floaters for as long as I can remember. When I first noticed them, I went to the opticians, where I was referred to the hospital for extensive testing. They sent me away as there was “nothing” wrong. A couple of years later, I noticed that they were getting worse so I went back to the opticians. She said that there is a chance that I could go blind as the solution in my eyes are breaking down. I’m paranoid that I will go blind, I know there is a cure but it may not work. My vision is getting worse and I’m struggling to read."

Conjunctivitis,Recurrent Corneal Erosion - advice please?,"So a few months ago I started getting watery eyes, usually the left but occasionally the right too, along with soreness (limited by the hefty amount of pain meds I am already on, but still enough to cause me enough discomfort that I can't open my eye when it tears right up), massive watering (i'd look like my whole side of my face was red and swollen like after a massive crying fit), halos around lights, photosensitivity, a sensation of grit but not dryness, and it came and went in waves - worse first thing in the morning and sometimes it was OK for a few days and other times it happened every hour, maybe lasting a minute or two or for hours at a time with my eye spasmed shut. My GP was clueless and sent me to my optician, said it was probably faster than waiting to see the hospital because my eyes ached and with the blurring he was concerned about glaucoma as there were no obvious signs of infection or injury.My optician fitted me in within the hour and had to numb my eyes enough to do the pressure, check the retina and use the slit lamp to examine my corneas. He had to use local anaesthetic because by that point I could barely open my eyes, and couldn't tolerate the light from the lamp - even the fluorescent strip lights hurt. Daylight was worse. A quick drop of dye and a blue lamp showed that I have corneal erosions - a big wide band right across my pupil on the left and a smaller one on the right. I have no idea what triggered it - nothing stands out, it just started out of the blue one day. He suggested I get a prescription for eyedrops - suggested some which my GP was kind enough to write a prescription for when I popped back to the surgery afterwards, even though I didn't have another appointment. One was Clinitas carbomer 0.2% gel and the other one was Lacri-Lube which basically feels like vaseline in my eyeball. I actually found the Lacri-Lube more irritating and unusable, it left my vision unbearably blurred for several hours too. The Clinitas is better and has reduced my discomfort - I'll even go several days sometimes without any symptoms. But it never lasts, even though I keep using them, it just comes and goes, and it's not actually seeming to fix the underlying issue.I've been using them for 6 weeks now and I would appreciate more advice - should I be asking for a hospital referral as it doesn't appear to be resolving quickly? And what other self help things can I do? What would the next step be - a bandage lens? Or steroids and a tetracycline? Would an external eyepatch help? I don't particularly want to resort to surgical/needle related treatments if I can avoid them.I use tinted lenses now to minimise glare and bright light, and I slowly open my eyes in the mornings, I try to avoid rubbing or touching my eyes, and stay away from fumes or smoke I try not to sleep long stretches which is hard with other illnesses I have but I try and reapply drops after a few hours when I wake through the time I'm sleeping. But I'm really frustrated by this, it's sore and achy and makes everything different when I can't open my eye to see and even when I do, it's blurry and haloed and painful. I can't even have a decent cry over it, as crying just makes it worse too! "

Conjunctivitis,Very weird issues with my vision please help !!!!,"I dont even know where to start or how to describe my symptoms properly... here is my best attempt of describing my aymptoms...1. I sometimes get a weird head ache which comes with little pain, and mild light headedness and i am only listing this as a symptom because i heard migranes have to do with symptoms but i only sonetimes have these head aches and pain killers dont help...2. My vision is not too blury but almost staticy.. but i dont believe it is snow viaion because it is colord almost as if they are the equivilent of seeing tiny tiny tiny stars but all over your bision looking at abything...3 . Next is that these stars are sometines moving in different spots in my vision which i cant directly look at in the same way you cant look at eye floaters...4. I see eye floater.. lol idl how else i can describe it but i sometines see eye floaters as regular ones that you would imagine, as if they are individual or clumps of cells or sometimes one black tiny tiny black circle...5. Next is things i look at almost morph some times.. almost as if surfaces are breathing, pulsing, twisting, sliding, etc 6. The next one is very weird yet very rarely do i run into this... sonetimes everything looks less 3d if that makes sense.7. I used to see blodges of random colors or grey blobs but i have not experienced that for the past 2 years i believe.8. Idk if everyone experiences this or not but if i look at somthing speciphically my phone, everything around ut goes blurry.9. When i close my eyes i see lots of shapes and colors and stars and things I believe those are all my symptoms and if i remember or can pick out anymore ill mention them. I should also point of a couple other things... i drink quite a bit more than a 17 year old probably should and i believe that is effecting my nervs because spots in my feet are going numb, and my arms or hands sometimes randomly get tingily but not numb as if they are asleep but i still have full fonction of them if that makes sense so i dont know if that would have to do with anything. I also dont get much sunlight and i am not very active anymore... i have a decent diet, i am vegan but i still eat alot of junk food. I have had severe panic dissorder which has tubed down a bit and is what i would consider a healthy amount or maybe a but too much ancxiety. I spend most of my time stareing at a screen. I dont get a tun of sleep or i get way too much sleep. I have also had between 5-7 concussions, some un diagnosed others were 2 major 1 regular and 2 minor. Lastly i dont kbow if this would have to do with it nit i use to smoke quite a bit of weed until i smoked something laced and tripped and then i started vapeing it for a year and i heard thc is not the greatest for your vision although it can help glaucoma and i have not done any other drugs except for a unhealthy amount of benidrill by mistake when i was younger. I vape cbd now but it is suppose to be verry benificual and i obly vape it for pain and axiety/depresion and it really helps so i am going to buy cbd acctract, pills, wax and bud. Only reason i mentioned that is be ause i have read that thc could cause snow vision and psychadellics could cause vision problems and like i said i smoked sonethibg laced by accident. I dont kbow what else to say but this is really bugging me and makeing me depressed to a point and has caused what i would like to call de realization... please any info would be apreciated Im just a 150 pound 5'6"" 17 year old dude who just watches netflix and goes out here and there. (I also have posture which might not be as gould as it ahould be... my back is pushed in a but more than normal in the centre, my neck is a little bit more forwars thab normal and my shoulder blades are pushed back the slightesr slightest bit)-sorry if alot of this information is useless but im giveing u all the info i can incase if it can helpI WILL ALSO NOTE THAT LAST YEAR MY EYE DOCTOR SAID I WAS FINE!!!-sorry if there are spelling mistakesi am useing my phone and it has no spell check"

Conjunctivitis,"I have had blurry vision, neck stiffness, and foggy on and off","Hi I apologize but my thought process is all over the place. I have been experiencing neck stiffness, vision blurred and dizziness/ foggy feeling off and on for about 3 months now.I originally went to the Drs about 3 months ago for a bad migraine that led to my vision being blurry and neck stiffness. I had a MRI of my head done and blood work with nothing out of the normal. Wasn’t diagnosed with anything, chalked it up to stress. The episode lasted about 3 to 4 weeks then went away. It has recently came back about a week ago. It started with neck being really stiff, vision blurred off and on, and a feeling of being lightheaded. Then about a week later I had a bad migraine again. Saw auras and intense pain afterward, had to lay down for about 2 hours. The following day I woke up with only a slight stiff neck and my vision seemed to be a little better. Could all my neck stiffness and blurry vision been a warning of the migraine to come a week before? I work on the computer about 8-9 hours a day and my vision seems to get worse as the day goes on. Any ideas on what this could be? I have been to the chiropractor and the neck stiffness seems to be getting better but my vision is still blurry. I have an eye doctors appointment next week. Getting furstrated, it’s hard to work with the blurry vision. "

Conjunctivitis,Issue with right eye - Foreign Body sensation?,"Hi,I am wondering if anyone has any advice or experienced similar issues as I am at my wits end with it.Around 2 months ago I started experiencing a feeling that there was something in my right eye, as if there is a hair lying across it. I didn't go away after a few days so I got it checked at A&E who confirmed there was nothing in it and it was not scratched.I used drops for irritated eyes but it still hadn't improved so I went to the opticians a few days later for an eye test. They again confirmed that there was nothing in my eye and that my vision is pretty much perfect. They said my right eye could have a prescription, but would be that small it would make no difference. After this the issues seemed to disappear.However, in the 3 weeks the symptoms have come back with a vengeance. The sensation that again there is something in my eye and the constant urge to rub it. I bought different kinds of eye drops for dry eyes and they made no difference. I went back to the opticians who again said there was nothing in the eye and my eyes were not dry but said it looked like there was an allergic reaction. I got drops for allergies and took antihistamines and used cold compression but this hasn't helped. I don't think it is due to allergies as like before it is only affecting one eye. I then went back to the hospital and the doctor prescribed antibiotic eye ointment to take for 5 days, which ended yesterday and it has also not helped. I am now going to book another appointment with my GP but does anyone have any advice in the mean time?The symptom of something in the right eye are almost constant, no drops are relieving it. My eye does seem to be better when I am outside. They get worse at a computer screen or when I am reading. Today I feel quite light headed and finding it hard to focus."

Conjunctivitis,Fixated on going blind from phone usage habit in the dark before bed. PLEASE HELP. ,"I am now 21 but have developed a huge fear of going blind in the future probably in my 30s or 40s or even sooner. During my younger days probably 13 14 years old I used to sneak my iphone in bed and play games before i go to bed. I used my phone in pitch dark as I didn't want my parents to catch me. So now here I am, worried sick everyday and have been living in regrets since. This sucks because I have no one to blame but myself if I go blind one day due to glaucoma or macular degeneration.All I do is beat myself up and overthink and think till i can't sleep or function properly even though my eyesight is fine right now. I've been to the ophthalmologist at least 3 times in the past few years just to reassure my fears, but still I can't help but to think that I'll go blind soon, maybe in a few years and GOD it takes the life out of me now. I want to gain my motivation back, I want to fight this and enjoy life at the moment but I can't as I am obsessed with this thought and haunted with deep regrets every single second. I think I am going mad and I can't deal with this anymore. "

Conjunctivitis, Does the brain adapt after an eye injury?," I had a bad accident last month. I tripped while carrying a heavy tray of food and glasses. Went flying, the tray landed on the marble floor before I did, and the broken glass Entered my Eye and slashed into my face. Doctors did a five hour operation to save the eye, and told me that the retina have been severed in several places. I now have minimal vision in that I, just shadows, shapes and light. The day of the accident the doctors assured me that in time the brain takes over and compensates for the bad eye and that your vision goes almost back to normal. Has anyone had experience with this?"

Conjunctivitis,Been seeing some weird stuff in my vision. ,"Okay. It’s been a few months now. First symptoms were an onset of Floaters in my vision. Went to the Eye doctor and got an OCT. Everything was normal. Now, my vision is hazy when looking at bright lights and I see rainbow halos around street lamps and other bright lights. Got tested for Acute Glaucoma and was clear. I also notice a smear of light when I’m in the dark and move my eyes away from a light. Another problem I’m having is if I’m looking at a White computer screen and I blink, it seems like the screen flickers. These last few weeks I’ve been waking up with very dry eyes. Anyone know what I’m experiencing or am i going insane? "
Conjunctivitis,Blurred vision in one eye,"I've had blurred vision in my left eye for about 8 months.I've had 3 eye exams at Specsavers since then; all said my eye looks healthy.I've been given a prescription which corrects the blurriness.However, my left eye seems to produce less tears. On my first visit to Specsavers I was also told my left eye is dry, which may be causing the blurriness.What could be causing this? Any help is appreciated. Thanks."
Conjunctivitis,Retinal Detachment,"My husband suffered a detached retina a couple of weeks ago, unfortunately it had been detached a few days before it was diagnosed the surgery was done to preserve the remaining vision not restore the vision he lost.

Does anyone know how long it will be before he can drive because his job involves driving. Many thanks"
Conjunctivitis,weird shadow / lines in vison ,"for the past 2 months + I have been experiencing very distressing vison symptoms and i’m beyond bored and sick of them now. I can’t even concentrate on my life because I always feel the need to keep testing it so see if it’s still there it’s really taking over my life and any help would be really appreciated at the moment. The main one is a line in my vison that I have in the inner left corner of my right eye next to my nose. It IS NOT a floater ! it doenst float, it just moves with my head it’s almost like there’s a line sitting on top of my eye that’s what it looks like. so if i look at blank wall and move my head in circles while keeping my eyes focused on the wall, the line moves with my vison ! (there’s also a line in my left eye that isn’t as pronounced. The line in my right eye becomes more obvious and a lot darker if I pull the skin on my cheekbone down ie my lower eyelid. the line appears as a grey shadow when i look up to the ceiling and roll my eyes anti clockwis. or when i stand next to a wall so the wall is to the left of me and then move my eyes from right to left i see it on the wall in my right eye. does anybody know what this could be?? it’s a lot worse when i’m crying (and i’m crying a lot due to the stress of it) . I have seen several opticians and have been sent to eye doctors and ophthalmologists and had countless tests and scans of my eyes and everything was normal !! i’m completely at a loss for what to do can anybody tell me what this might be ? thank u so much , alex.

Conjunctivitis,"Eyelid feeling odd, eye seems larger than the other","Hello,Can you please let me know what are the reasons why my top eyelid in right eye could be feeling heavy/swollen/odd for the past 5 weeks but not showing any visual signs of drooping or swelling? Medical history below:1. Addison and Hashimoto diagnosed, on treatment2. No other conditions diagnosed/found3. Visited 3 different eye doctors trying to find an answer. 2 diagnosed and treated a ""conjunctivitis"" with no improvement after 16 days of treatment. 3rd told me I need glasses for astigmatism on that right eye (-0.5) and that every other test the 3rd doctor performed came clear, no eye problems or infections other than the slight loss of vision for which he prescribed glasses. I am currently wearing those glassesMy eyelid is not swollen and it does not hurt. I have no pain in my eye.My eyes get red (I work at a PC all day) and tired especially in the evening but the heaviness is present only in the 1 eye and does not go away. It came on suddenly and hasn't changed for the past 5 weeks. I don't wear contacts. I haven't had any eye/head injury/trauma. I don't have any allergies. I am 31 yo.For the past few days I noticed that my right eye does not squint as much the left eye when I smile, making it look bigger. I am confused weather this is really an eye issue or a nerve issue. I can close my eyes fine, my smile looks normal, but my right eye doesn't squint the same as my other eye and that heavy feeling is still there on the eyelid. I've been to 3 doctors and none asked anything about any neurological issues or mentioned any nerve issues, I don't know what else to do.Thank you."
Conjunctivitis,Blurry Vision after Retinal Tear Laser Treatment,"Hi! I'm 22 and had retinal tear treatment for both my eyes. My right eye had 2 holes and my left retina was thinning out. It's been about 3 weeks since I've gotten the the treatment, but my eyes are both still dilated and my close vision is blurry. I've been back to the doctors and he gave me Isopto Carpine Eye Drops to use 4 times a day for a week. The drops give me really bad eyebrow aches that last about 2 hours and my far vision is blurry for the rest of the day. The drops help constrict my pupils, so I am able to see things up close.The whole laser treatment procedure was painful and recovery was also painful.Is anyone else experiencing the same things, and will my pupils go back to it's original size?I just feel really discouraged right now ."

Conjunctivitis,Having weird eye problem for few weeks now and getting worried,"It started of minor and I barely noticed the pain above my eye area around the eyebrows and close to the nose bridge. The pain will always go away whenever I sleep and when I wake up it's fine but it's always later on the pain will randomly appear again until I sleep like a cycle. Days and weeks went by as I thought it'll go away like a headache but it's still doing the exact same thing. It feels like a bruise around that area above my eyes but visually there is nothing, no bruise, no red eyes or anything. There feels like its a bit more bumpy then the other side but barely can feel the difference. It hurts constantly like a bruise and hurts more when pushed on.I've tried researching what it is but I still can't find what it is so I'm not sure how to treat it. I know most will say just go to the GP but it'll take awhile and I want to know ASAP."

Conjunctivitis,weird line and shadow in vision,"hi there i really hope somebody can help me because this has been going on for two months and i’m so borderline sick of it and it makes me so upset every single day with worry. basically i have this line ( it’s NOT a floater ) in my vison next to my nose in both eyes but it’s more pronounced in my right, that moves with my head. for example if i look at a wall and then spin my head or move it up and down i can see the line because it follows it. when i roll my eyes the line becomes more obvious and when i pull down my eyelid on my cheekbone a shadow grows in my vison the further i pull which makes the line darker. this is the same in both eyes. when i wake up in the morning and in blinking there is a shadow in each eye when i’m blinking similar to the ones i get when pulling my eyelid down. also when i move my eyes from right to left , as i move them, a grey arc appears in my right eye next to where the line is . i have seen three opticians and two ophthalmologists and have had so many tests / scans of my eyes and everything is fine . so i don’t have any explanation for these horrible symtoms any ideas? i suffer from major health anxiety so this is a nightmare for me "

Nothing causes it and there’s no pattern but it happens quite regularly - sometimes it will happen daily and other times I can go a few days to a week without it. Though recently it’s been getting worse and more frequent, yesterday it happened while I was concentrating and it lasted a good 3 seconds to the point where I was about to shout for my boyfriend as I couldn’t see.

I've had it for over a decade and it's been remarked on by various opticians. Quite frankly, it's ugly and I've always been able to feel it, I can see it if I look upwards and I've noticed that it means my right (affected) eye closes less completely than the left (unaffected).It's uncomfortable and makes me incredibly self-conscious and I've never had a positive doctors experience so I didn't want to go if they just dismiss me as usual.Thanks for any advice."

Conjunctivitis,"Eye discomfort - told its dry eyes, not getting relief","The main issue I'm having is an odd haze or something like that. There's a hazy/cloudy distortion. It's relentless and I've been experiencing it for 8-10 months straight, every moment I'm awake. It's almost like I can see the air moving in front of me (that's one way I've tried to describe it)I'm pretty sure it's always there, but I notice it more for things that require being still and focusing, primarily when using the computer, but also while watching tv or reading. It also leads to my vision being a bit blurry, my eyes feeling uncomfortable, and my eyes sometimes feeling 'exhausted' by the mid point of the day (like by mid evening, they feel like I've been up for 2 days straight)I went to have an eye exam, and was told I have dry eyes- First I was told to try drops / artificial tears, which didn't help- So I called and the doctor told me some patients experience better results with this other type of artificial tears. So I bought those, used those for a few weeks, didn't help- Called again, they advised I try the ""preservative-free"" artificial tears. Did that again for a few weeks, didn't help.So I went to another eye doctor, who said the tear film on my eyes is very poor / thin. He gave me this regimen:- Artificial tears x 2 a day- Moist warm compress x 2 a day, 10 min each- And take Omega 3 supplements, 4 softgel capsules per day(he said this because I hate fish, and haven't had fish in over 12 years, so I must have an Omega 3 deficiency, and he said you need certain Omega 3 fatty acids to help against dry eyes)So I've been doing all of that now for 5 weeks straight... 4 pills a day, the warm compress, the drops, and they literally have not helped at all. There is no immediate improvement (the same hazy cloud remains right after -- there's no change after the drops or the warm compress in any way) and there's no long term improvement... about 30-35 days doing the exact same thing every single day and my eyes feel identical in every possible way.What more can I possibly do? It's incredibly frustrating since this hazy / cloudy film over my vision severely reduces my desire to do anything... to use my computer, to read, to watch television. The eye doctor says to keep doing it and it will feel better, but I not seeing any signs whatsoever of improvement. If there were even mild improvements, I'd feel optimistic. But nothing. It's the exact same as before I started any of the drops / nutrients / warm compress.Any advice??"

Up until recently my vision has been fine I've always kept up with doctors visits and physicals everything's always checked out I'm young and soon to be an adult. I suffer from terrible anxiety and am recovering from a lot of trauma I am physically active and participate in a sport I'm very passionate about and do not suffer from any head trauma. The symptoms I have, have been consistent for the past few months and have become more pronounced as the months progressed. I suffer from a very disorientating visual aura it blocks most of my vision and seems to be triggered by natural light outdoors the aura looks similar to the reflection of water against a well lit surface if that makes any sense. It covers any buildings im looking at roads, grass and the sky the aura used to be only visible when I looked up at the sky but as the months have progressed it became more defined and covers absolutely everything in the day light and well into the afternoon it doesn't ever go away unless I'm indoors with very dim light or if my eyes are behind sunglasses. I'm also suffering from blue field enthropic phenomenon the flashes are also persistent and never disappear and are numerous and very defined. No unusual increase in floaters ive always suffered from them, light now leaves a very defined trail and when I'm jumping or running I see what looks like grey veins covering the top of my vision. I've visited an eye doctor twice both times he said my vision was fine he looked inside of my eyeball it was very strange and kinda cool haha. I'm concerned about these symptoms and unsure what to do they've effected my social life and made studying and physical activity very difficult. My family does have a history of migraines and epilepsy maybe it has something to do with this, the aura effects both eyes at all times. If you read this thank you for taking the time to and I hope you can shed some light on whatever it is I'm experiencing kind regards!

Conjunctivitis,My left eye is irritated when I wear my contacts...,"Hello,So I have been wearing Air Optix contacts for at least 7 years and last year I noticed my left eye was kind having issues like it was a little itchy or dry (it almost felt like a hair was in my eye). It slowly got worse to the point where after a couple of months starting to feel that I couldn’t wear contacts. So I went to my annual eye exam to renew my prescription and the doctor didn’t see anything wrong. So they prescribed me to Biofinity contacts to see if my eye would be more comfortable with that, but that didn’t work, so then I tried the 1-Day Acuvue. Those seem to do better, but my left eye is still having issues. Here’s how it feels:My upper lid in the center is irritated (feels like it’s dry/itchy, like there’s a piece of hair stuck in my eye). The corner of my eye (closest to my nose) where my tear ducts are it feels the same way. When I go to take my contacts out, my eye becomes extremely itchy where my tear ducts are and it slowly goes away after a few hours. And it’s only the left eye, not the right eye. There isn’t really any redness or swelling, and my eye doesn’t water when it’s irritated either. I have tried tear drops, but that doesn't seem to help. Sorry for the long explanation, but any help is greatly appreciated."
Conjunctivitis,Weird circles and dots in vison,"Hey, recently I have been really really worried about a bunch of visul symtoms I have been having. The main one started in may and I began seeing like a flashing arc in my vison as I moved my eyes from right to left. The arc was only in my right eye and it was near the inner corner of my vison. That has gotten so much better but is still kind of there was is really irritating. For example when I stand next to a wall then roll my eyes I can see a weird line / black thing in the same area. I also have this thing where when I turn my eyes or head far to each side, a circle grows in my vison the further I stress my eye to the side, similar to the circle you see when you touch your eye. Another is when I am looking straight ahead at something and I shake my head slowly I can see like, again, similar to when you press your eye but I am not pressing anything it’s just like weird grey shadow in my vison. The last ones which I feel like are completely different, when I pull my lower eyelid down like where my cheekbone is, a grey shadow forms in my vison the further i pull it, is this just because of pressure ? idk, and when I wake up in the morning and I am looking at my ceiling I feel like the brightness of my ceiling is like flickering or flashing and it almost looks like rippling water. I have seen several opticians and various eye doctors and had every test and scan u can imagine , however there hasn’t been anything wrong . Any ideas? oh and I forgot that you kno when you touch your eye u see that circle ? well when I like tap my eye I see the circle but i also c like a line as well . UGH "
Conjunctivitis,Do I have a torn retina? Please can someone tell me if this is serious!?,"Hi, I’m 14 and I’m experiencing worrying symptoms. (Please bear in mind that I do have moderate nearsightedness (-4.75 in both eyes). So very very long story short, about 2/3 weeks ago I very suddenly saw about 2 or 3 floaters, and right before this I started to experience strange flashes in my eyes. Sometimes these can be pulsating black spots or drifting dark shadows or even flashing white dots. Since I started experiencing them (I have never ever experienced any of this before) it’s gotten worse by the day. They constantly happen now and are very distracting. They’re usually in my prephiral vision. The onset was extremely sudden, it just happened one day, and as I say, it’s gotten a lot worse. The floaters are now big and frequent, I can’t go a single day without seeing ad least 40/50. They’re mostly in a clumped sort of shape, but sometimes lines or circles. I see strange shapes (usually circles) flying around. I see big shadows flying across my vision frequently. I can really feel there’s something wrong. I have been to the doctor who has booked me and opthalmologist appointment, but the date still hasn’t been set yet. I should also mention that for about 4 months now I have had extreme glare/haloes/starbursts/double vision of light. Is this serious? Could it be a retinal detachment? Is this an emergency like I’ve read? I know that this is uncommon for my age. Any answers would be grately appreciated."
Conjunctivitis,"Had a bad cold, now have itchy/sore swollen eye with rash","I had a bad cold last week, and my right eye got quite itchy.

I'm not sure whether this is a skin problem or eye problem, but my eye is quite painful.I had a bad cold last week, and my right eye got quite itchy.

Conjunctivitis,"I was woken up last night by a sharp pain in my eye, again.","I was woken up in the middle of last night by a sharp pain in my right eye. It felt like someone stabbed the inside of my eye with a needle. It was very painful. It happened few more times afterward throughout my sleep though in lesser intensity, but they still hurt terribly. The pain in my eye lasted almost the whole following day. I have no choice but try to bear it when the pain isn’t too strong, but I’d definitely need medical attention when it gets as strong and painful as that last night. The problem is I need to make appointment to see a doctor and won’t be able to get help right away. It happened frequently in the past. I had been to the doctor few times for treatment and examination because of that. My doctor thought my eye problem was simply due to dryness in the eyes and nothing else. So he prescribed eye droplets to me and sent me away. I really disagreed with his diagnosis but I couldn’t offer any other explanation. I did use the droplets as instructed but evidently it didn’t work, just like last night.Unfortunately it is only one of many symptoms that associate with my sleep disorder for the past ten years. I’ve been getting this highly focused poking-like sensation which hits all over my body including my ears, nose and eyes. This sensation has different degree of intensity ranging from strong and powerful which hits me like a hammer to sharp and prickly which stabs me like a needle. It causes me great pain and seriously interrupts my sleep.Can anyone out there offer me a better diagnosis or explanation as to what’s happened to my eyes? It seems that my doctor has underestimated the problem and downplayed my symptoms. I tried to convey to him how painful it was, but sadly he just casually dismissed it as dryness in the eye and nothing out of the ordinary. It is obviously wrong.Please help."
Conjunctivitis,Suddenly blurred vision in Left eye. No one knows the reason,"Hi,I am 30, male, computer programmer. I've never had any problem in my eyes before, but 13 days ago my left eye got blurred and then I started getting dizzy sometimes. I went to the GP and he said it could be conjunctivitis (I didn't think it was, because my eye wasn't red or sticking). I applied the eyewash he prescribed for 5 days, no improvements though.Then I went to the eye hospital and they made a lot of exams (also with dilated pupil) and the doctor there said she couldn't find anything wrong in my eyes (My problem is in the left eye only) and then asked me to go back in 5 weeks time (24/08)After these exams I started felling my vision getting better. But today it is more blurred than yesterday (less than in the first days though). I check this by looking in some objects at home, which are always in the same place,and see if I can read the text on them. Other test is to try to focus the computer screen with the right eye covered... I could see reasonable well yesterday, today it is worse, but still better than the first days.After going to the eye hospital I went to the GP again, and he told me I should go to optician and maybe find a pair o glasses which would make me feel more comfortable.I don't want to wear glasses before be sure what was the cause for that problem. By my experience in this periodo of 13 days my vision goes better some days and worse other days. Maybe (and hopefully) it can be reversible.The symptoms I feel in my left eye are:- Blurred vision (Some days better, some days worse).- Sometimes it is itching;- Sometimes if hurts a bit;- Sometimes I feel like there is something inside it;- Sometimes I have a feeling as the eyelid is a bit glued;Something I tested yesterday was to see how light I have going through one eye and compare to the other.During the day I could see things with more brightness in the right eye (the good one).At night however, the left eye can capture much more light (still blurred though) as I almost thought I had infrared vision in my left eye...lol!!All this is confusing for me...I have high cholesterol (280) and I am over weight (Not hugely though). I also don't have a healthy diet.I always have perfect vision and now I am scared as this symptoms could be an alert for any other serious problem I have and don't know yet.P.S.: Sorry for my English, It's difficult to me to described the symptoms as my English is not so good.Can any one help me please?"
Conjunctivitis,short lived curvedline of small geometric images(triangles?) appears on left side of my peripheral ," 3 times in the past 8-9 months I have had a floating distortion in my field of vision - difficult to discern in detail but something like a (slightly curved?) L shape made up of a train of smaller L shapes (or triangles), situated to the left side of my field of vision and lasting for less than an hour in each case. I have had several bouts of laser surgery to repair a slight retinal tear in the past 20 years but have been in the clear for my past 2 bi-annual checkups.The line is sometimes partially coloured and has a geometric quality to it like a diffraction of light.Is this something anyone else has experienced?

Conjunctivitis,"Blurry vision in right eye for a week, doctors see nothing weong",Hello. This last week I’ve started noticing some blurriness in my right eye affecting the upper left part of my field of vision. It also feels like something is either wrong with my eyelids or even my eye itself as they both feel heavy and not as they usually do. I’ve seen two doctors: my optometrist and our family doctor. The family doctor numbed my eye to check under the eyelids and also used yellow dye to check for scratches on the surface. They both state they cannot see anything wrong with my eye or eyelids and that everything looks healthy and normal. I was hoping someone else on here might’ve gone through something similar or has any advice on what I should do next? I’m feeling pretty discouraged at this point. 
Conjunctivitis,Anxiety because of eyes,"Hello everyone, I went to get my eyelashes done for the first time in December. In the end of January I decided to take them off because my eyes were starting to bother me. They became itchy and my eyes were turning red. I bought liquid lash remover and they came off. The liquid did get into my eyes and since then I been having eye problems. I read reviews for the lash remover and some reviews said it takes off nail polish remover. I've been to two Optometrist and 2 Opthamologists. Two said I have environmental allergies and the other two never mentioned them at all. One Optometrist said I have flakes on my eyelashes. She never said blepharitis though. I woke up one day to a swollen right eyelid. They get itchy sometimes and I try not to rub them too hard otherwise I get blurry vision. My right eye has been blurry for about a month and a half. They all said I should use lubrication drops. The Opthamologist said it takes the eye long to recover. Not sure how true that is. They all said I have good eyes. I'm not sure if I believe that. Doctors tend to say nothing is wrong when they can't find out what the problem is.I've been having anxiety issues over this and this literally consumes my life. I've been having floaters, flashes of light and sometimes double vision. I'm scared that I'll go blind. I'm not sure because of my anxiety and panic attacks that I'm seeing everything now. I cry because this has taken a toll on me.Has anyone experienced this and everything was okay? I would like to know because I'm having anxiety over this. Thank you in advance."
Conjunctivitis,Historical Detached Retina,"I just wondered if anyone else has been diagnosed with a historical detached retina?Back in 2011 I was referred by my optician to see an ophthalmologist as I was getting flashes of white light in my left eye. I was told I had Posterior Vitreous Detachment and also a schisis by 2 different specialists, one of them from BUPA and the other from the community clinic run by Moorfields. I still have the letters from them both saying I didn't have a detached retina.However in the past 6mths or so I had started to notice some flickering in my peripheral vision so went to the optician. She was concerned that I had lost some of my peripheral vision and gave me an urgent referral to the eye unit at my local hospital.I was seen by 2 different ophthalmologists and asked to come back the next day to see a retina specialist. When I saw him he was concerned that I might have a historical detached retina and referred me to a retina surgeon at Moorfields.So today I went to see him and was really shocked when he told me that not only did I have a historical detached retina, but the scarring looked so old that it had probably detached way before 2011!He doesn't think it's a good idea to perform surgery on the eye as he thinks the risks of losing my central vision is too high and he'd rather just keep an eye on things to see if things get worse. I guess he is hoping that as it's not progressed that much over the years that it will stay like that.However I still can't get my head around the fact that not only was this missed by previous ophthalmologists but I was always under the impression that when a retina detached that you lost the vision from that eye.Makes no sense at all to me.

So if I do not do an eye wash EVERY NIGHT they get bad and are still pretty bad even with the nightly eye wash. I do not believe it is hygiene related as even when I wear no makeup or anything and wash my face goodand do the eye wash it still happens EVERY MORNING regardless of what I do. Some days are better than others. Here are my symptoms:- Red eyes that won't go away even with Visine. (The eye that is more red seems to alternate)- Gritty eyes- Eyes get super dry to the point my upper eyelids are drooping and I cannot open them-Vision has worsened / became more blurry and not gone back to normal- Itchy at night sometimes - Goopy in morning (not sealed shut like with pink eye, more like thick gel feeling tears with a little colored goop in eye corners)PLEASE HELP!

Conjunctivitis,Severe myopia / retinal detachment questions,"Hello,My 42 year old wife has severe myopia / retinal detachment. She has a tremendous amount of floaters and seeing is becoming challenging for her these days. Her prescription is approximately -15 in each eye if this is needed. Computer work especially is coming to a point where maybe she cannot continue any longer with her work. She has been seeing a local Dr but I think with her condition I would like to find a specialist that can confirm or give her some hope that things can be fixed or the inverse. Is there a specific type of Dr she should see that can do this? I am willing at this point to fly some place too if there is a specialist that can help her at this point. Any help or suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks."

Conjunctivitis,Bilateral Scotoma,"Following a minor stroke last September, which started with a blind spot in my left eye, I saw a neuro opthalmologist and had some tests done. I have just received a copy of the letter sent to my doctor and it says I have a Bilateral Scotoma. In both eyes apparently and in exactly the same position. This was obviously known following my tests, but no-one has explained to me what it is exactly, what caused it, whether it's treatable. I was taking statins after my stroke, but took myself off them as I had terrible side effects. Could they be responsible for this latest problem.I now have to wait until October for more tests ""to check on its progress"".Why don't people explain things to you any more. I am now really worried it might be something serious, and the worry is stressing me so much, I have developed a stiff neck and my headaches are more and more frequent (like pressure in my head) and my vision is blurry and I frequently feel dizzy.My doctor is rubbish when I asked her about it, she just shone her little torch in my left eye and said ""yes, a blind spot"".Can anyone enlighten me please."

Conjunctivitis,Constant Pain/Pressure Behind Both Eyes (Help Needed),"Bio: Hello, I'm Jim. I'm 28 and I live near Tampa, Florida. I'm seeking help with regards to eye pain. I've had constant pain behind both eyes for as long as I can remember; 8+ years. I cannot cope well with life like this anymore I'd appreciate your time; I know it's a long read, but this means more than you can imagine!Pain (scale 1-10): The pain level behind both eyes is 3-4 on bad days and .5 to 1 on good days. I feel constant pressure behind both of my eyes (feels like it's on the top/behind my eye lids). The feeling is like a light to medium pinching sensation (like if you pinch your skin before it hurts too much) and is 24/7. The pain is the worst in the morning when waking up and is less at night.Contributing Factors: SLEEP (main): A good night's sleep will determine the day's pain level. Sleep less than 9 hours will result in a pain level of 3-4 and the entire day is hard to grind through.LIGHT: Sensitive to light; must wear sunglasses outside (even if cloudy) and sometimes inside (hockey game/bright lights and at casino playing slot machines).COMPUTER: Cannot be on the computer more than 15 minutes in the morning or afternoons. READING: Cannot be on the computer more than 15 minutes in the morning or afternoons.Remedies: A well night's sleep is most important. Used sleep medication in past, but do not want to become addicted (do not want pain killers either). The follow helps about half the pain: Advil, caffeine, high fat/high carb foods, putting coco butter on the top of my eyelids lightly, and/or a good nap.Tried: Ophthalmologist(s) and had orbital cat scan. Eyes are healthy/no glaucoma. Tried various eye drops (some prescribed) and sinus techniques, all did not help. I gave up seeking more specialists because I could not afford more doctors visits (I do not have good health insurance); so I decided to accept the pain and cope with it. I remain on a good diet/exercise regimen and my vision is not rapidly deteriorating or had any vision loss.Cannot: Travel, do anything in the mornings, use my computer IT degree (be on the computer for hours a day), or read much at a time. The pain effects my mood and morale Want: I would love any suggestions/support that you can provide! I plan on paying out of pocket to speak to a neuro-ophthalmologist about my issue. After Googling, if I had to guess it's some type of nerve damage, but behind both eyes... I'm not sure how both are the same pain level. Also, I would think the pain level would be least in the mornings (after sleeping and having eyes closed), but, on the contrary, the pain level is least at night and worst in the mornings.I would love to travel with my new girlfriend, but sleep is so paramount (to my pain level), that I must use my own bed in my blacked-out/cool room. My life revolves around me coping with this pain, and I wish I could live a normal life - wake up early, work on the computer, and just live life to the fullest! Thank you for reading and God bless -Jim"
Conjunctivitis,Possible Retinal hole,"I saw the retinal specialist today and he said he notices what may or may not be a retinal hole in my left eye. He said it's not a tear. He suggested that a laser treatment is recommended although he said it's okay if we monitor it and take a decision later. I have a follow-up in 2 months.My symptoms are not exactly flashes of light, but more like lights getting turned off and on. It lasts less than a second and are not very frequent.He sounded like the procedure isn't a big deal and is a very quick one. Any thoughts on should I get it done immediately or wait it out?"

Conjunctivitis,"I've come to terms with my current FLOATERS, is there anything I can do so they don't get worse?","I've posted about my floaters before.Some days i'm more anxious than others about them, and I see them more often some days. I've noticed the past two years they have gotten worse. I see an eye doc once to twice a year and get my eyes dialated. She said they were healthy, although I do have dry eyes and I use non-preservative drops. I eat as healthy as I can and i'm a healthy girl. I'm 23 years old and i'm just so scared that these will get even worse because i'm so young & already experiencing them pretty bad. Nobody in my life has them so they look at me like i'm crazy when I bring it up. Has anyone heard of any tips to prevent them from getting WORSE? I'm aware the ones I have will probably never go away. Any help on them not getting worse would be awesome, or your experience of them. I have really bad anxiety disorder so I probably focus on them too much also. Please help!!!!! Any info would help me. These things are so annoying I can't believe nobody has come up with anything yet/doctors think it's no big deal. I have them in both eyes and i can't go outside without them blocking my vision at some point and even the TV screen/phone screen sometimes when it's too bright. I get depressed when I think about it for too long.... talking about it helps though I guess. "

Conjunctivitis,Strabismus,I have read that Strabismus may cause social and learning disabilities which may be scored on the autism scale.

Conjunctivitis,Blurred vision freaking me out! Please help!,"So the thing is I'm 20 female , a computer science and engineering Student. Although I'm being anxious for like 2 years(not taking any medication), I had experienced blurred vision for like 1 or 2 seconds sometimes but it usually go away. Also I'm myopic. I wear -2.25 glasses since the age of 15.

Conjunctivitis,Are eye floaters a neurological symptom?,"I started seeing eye floaters in both eyes suddenly after a week of injuring my neck. I saw an opthalmologist who tested for retinal detachment and wanted me to see a specialist as she thought there could be a retinal hole. The specialist did more tests and said he didn't see anything wrong with my eyes. I asked him about the floaters and didn't get a convincing response. He did mention that someone floaters could be due to a neurological issue (I have had brain MRI to rule out any issue) and that the floaters will ""go away"" after some time.My understanding is that floaters are due to condensation of the vitreous fluid. Are there different types of floaters? Why did he think it'll go away on its own?"
Conjunctivitis,Can a macular pucker get worse over time?,"I'm 71 and I've had a macular pucker - or epiretinal membrane - in my right eye for about 6 years. I was told by a specialist about 4 years ago that it had settled and, as my vision is reasonable, they didn't want to operate. I was quite happy with this and, apart from having different sized images in both eyes and wavy lines in the affected one, I've compensated OK.I was referred to a consultant a few months ago, who diagnosed ocular rosacea and also commented on the macular pucker. Now, instead of a follow-up with the same consultant, I've had a letter asking me to see the macular specialist.So, my question is; can a macular pucker, even though appearing to have settled, degenerate over time? Will my sight in that eye get worse? I'd be interested to hear the experiences of those with a macular pucker."

Conjunctivitis,FML eye drop overuse,"I have been having eye allergy for the past 2 years. I went to an ophthalmologist and she prescribed me with FML eye drop and a lubricant. Not knowing the severe side effects of FML eye drop, I used it about 4-5 months, one drop daily. One day, my right eye got really red and after a visit to the ophthalmologist, she warned that the drop is only to be used short term and if otherwise it could lead to blindness. However, I have got my eye pressure checked and it was normal. I have stopped using the drop since August 2017 and my eye pressure seems normal. However Im still worried whether my overuse of the eye drop could lead to eye problems in the future. Im also skeptical about my current vision as sometimes I see floaters under bright sun. Im not sure whether this existed before but Im current really concious about my eye and the doctor seems to be dismissal about my situation. Im really worried. Please help."

Conjunctivitis,Eye Floaters/Flashes - but no PVD or Retinal issues,"After a neck injury, I started seeing eye floaters. I got my eyes checked by an Opthamologist and a Retinal Specialist and everything was normal. Several weeks later, I started to see flashes. So, I went back to get tested. They took pictures of the back of the eye and said that they don't see holes or tears. They said it could be neurological due to my neck injury. Can we see eye floaters and flashes even when there's nothing physically wrong with the eye? It's driving me crazy as I am trying to get to the bottom of the issue but unable to find answers."
Conjunctivitis,Flashes of light and swirling in peripheral vision of left eye,"Hi,I am a 25 year old female and for the last 2 months I have had constant flashes of light and swirling in the peripheral vision of my left eye. When my eye is shut or I am in a dimly lit environment I can see the flashes, but when it is bright I can only see swirling (like oil in water). When my eyes are shut I can also see the light. This is constant and has not stopped at all since it started. It is not an occular or a regular migraine (the flashes and aura for these only last for up to an hour and have suffered with this in the past, it is a very different sensation) and I have been told by one doctor and an ophthalmologist it could be PVD but I have now had 3 eye exams and none have shown anything. In fact I have been told my eyes are perfect. I have just recently had an MRI and am waiting results to make sure it’s nothing coming from my brain, but to me it does feel more like it’s coming from my actual eye. It does not seem how it does when you get flashes from standing up to quickly etc. I really just want to know if anyone else has suffered with this and if you’ve had any answers?"
Conjunctivitis,I see static all the time. Is there something wrong with my eyes?,"There's constant static in my field of vision, and there has been since I was probably ten. The static becomes very dense in the dark and when I close my eyes. I have to wear glasses as my sight is bad over all, but even when I wear the glasses, I still see static. I thought this was normal, and everyone experienced this, until I brought it up to my friends at school and they said they didn't see it. I asked a lot of people after that, including people who also wore glasses, and they said they didn't see it either. I would ask a doctor, but my family doesn't have one and I'd rather not go into the ER for something that isn't an emergency. I wanted to get lasik eye surgery once I was old enough, since I want to travel and hate glasses. Does this mean I can't fix my sight? Please help.I don't know if I should also note this, but I also feel foggy all the time. Like my head is in a cloud, no matter how much sleep I get. "
Conjunctivitis,White Bump Under Upper Eyelid,"Just yesterday I noticed something rubbing against my contact lense. So I thought something was in my eye maybe an Eyelash or pice of dirt.

Conjunctivitis,Annoying new eye floaters,"HiSo I know most people get floaters as I'm sure I've always had them, but the last couple of days I've noticed many more of them which just constantly swirling about my vision. I did go to the eye hospital a couple of weeks ago to have the back of my eye checked out as, it turns out I was only having a migraine, but having never had one before I got checked out just in case. So I'm wondering if these floaters are simply new and annoying floaters which may or may not settle down on their own, as if it was something more serious, would it not have been picked up when I was at the eye hospital?Thanks"

Conjunctivitis,Where do I find an expert in UK in anisometropia???,"Good afternoon,After having surgery in one eye to remove a corneal scar, I now have an imbalance issue between my two eyes prescription, causing headaches.

The problem I have is I have been to 4 different opticians/eye doctors & had 4 different prescriptions/reading glasses, and I am still getting headaches. I know the next option is to get LASIK surgery in one eye to bring it in line with the other, I.e. replicating what the contact lens is doing. I need to see someone in the UK who is an expert in eye imbalance issues ( anisometropia ) as it appears standard opticians/optometrists don’t appear to be able to help me.

Conjunctivitis,Vision Problem but no clinical issue with eyes ?,"Hello All, I'm searching for answers here. 2 months ago I had elective key-hole surgery to remove my gallbladder. It went well and after 2 weeks I was about to return to work when my vision started to deteriorate. About a week prior I'd been getting dry eyes and then some pain around the orbits which I needed to medicate with paracetamol eventually the drugs would not help and from the Sunday to the Wednesday I had a particualry severe headache (Moday/Tuesday I'd say was debilitating). I went to Drs, opticians and back to Drs - opticians could find nothing clinically and Dr did blood tests to rule out GCA and TIA was considerd but not really symptomatic. Headaches resolved but vision kept deteriorating. Went back to Opticians who agreed and got me seen asap at Opthamology department. More tests inc. 2 very poor field of vision tests, again people were 'stumped' and so an MRI was undertaken but again - all clear. Guy I saw yesterday tried to tell me the field of vision tests were because I wasn't used to equipment (but previous Dr had said it was 'impossible' to fabricate results!). So as it stands it appears I need to return to work. Although things have improved (esp. left eye) my right eye still has some issues which I feel are brought on by excercise/walking but also VDU usage. I've asked for referal and am waiting to see a neurologist but just wanted to see if anyone had experienced similar? Also during this time my pulse went from a daily mean of around 57 up to 72 and has then come back down to 55 (and sometimes is getting to 45 at points during the day).

I retraced the eye movements and realized it wasn't actually the lights flickering it was my eyes making it appear as though it was. Ever since then i have noticed the ""flickering"" when i move my eyes and i think i've seen it without moving them aswell, always in my peripheral vision. The best way i can describe it is it looks like a sudden flicker of a lightbulb aka it is a dark flicker. I hope someone can help me as i am afraid it may be retinal detachment"

Conjunctivitis,Blepharitis? Dry Eyes? Neither??? Post Superficial Keratectomy. HELP!!,"Hi All!I am new here and this is my first post. I’ve read quite a few other posts however on here and know this is an active and supportive community. I could certainly use your help!I’ll try to keep this a short as possible while hitting all of the important facts…..I’m 35 and until last summer I have never had any eye issues, I didn’t even have an optometrist or ophthalmologist and had 20/15 vision in both eyes. Then my little daughter accidently hit me in the right eye with a yogurt pouch and caused a corneal abrasion. I want to an ophthalmologist and within a week or two all was back to normal. Then again at the end of January, unbelievably, my daughter got the same eye (right) with a book this time, a new corneal abrasion and back to the ophthalmologist. Again, a week or so later, fine. But…about a month later, the symptoms had come back over night on their own, over the course of the next month they waxed and waned and the ophthalmologist said it was recurrent corneal erosion and I underwent a Superficial Keratectomy (about 2 ½ weeks ago now).NOW HERE IS WHERE I NEED SOME HELP/THOUGHTS/GUIDANCE. I saw the ophthalmologist again last week (about 2 weeks post op) because BOTH eyes were uncomfortable and did not feel right (I had complained about the OTHER eye for about 6 weeks before the Superficial Keratectomy as well but they never saw anything when looking at it with the slit lamp). The other (non-acute injury) eye would always feel like there was something in it when I went to sleep or tried to rest it. Both eyes felt inflamed, sore, and gritty hence I went back as it was getting worse with time. The non-acute injured eye actually feeling the worse of the two.Up until now the ophthalmologist has been great, but here is where some disappointment set in. After looking at the eyes, and a brief 5 minute conversation, in which he talked about Blepharitis and dry eye, and then proceeded to say it could be lifelong I was ushered out and told to follow up as needed. 6 months ago I had 20/15 vision with no eye issues at all and now I may have a lifelong condition, had a 5 minute talk, and follow up as needed!!!!! I don’t even know what I have or if there was an official diagnosis or not – Blepharitis or dry eye, or neither???? He told me to wean off eye drops (lubricating, preservative free is what I was using) and use a warm compress, that’s it!!! No “let’s get ahead of this”, take this antibiotic, nothing!!!He seems almost uninterested now that the “sexy” surgery/injury part is over and I don’t want to become a “frequent flyer” and feel like I am not wanted in the office.My symptoms:Slightly red eyes, gritty feeling (hard to describe, but like cobwebs or something over/in my eyes that can’t be removed), foreign body feeling when closing them for any period of time, sometimes blurry vision and occasionally stingy. NO “crusties” or light sensitivity however.My actions:Using Thera Tears SteriLid cleanser each morning, a 10-minute warm compress mask each evening and that is about it. Trying to avoid eye drops since the ophthalmologist said to wean off.I used a ton of the preservative free drops and some prescription drops and pills post op (all prescribed), and a lot of preservative free drops during the initial corneal abrasions and subsequent erosions. Could I have lost my natural tears?This is causing such anxiety and life/marriage stress it is not even funny (2 girls under 2 at home). Does anyone have a similar story or thoughts as to what I may/may not have or should do??? Any similar experiences?Sorry this was so long, but I’d love to hear back. Let me know if anyone needs more info or has questions.Thank you!!!!"

Conjunctivitis,eye problems,"i am a 13 year old ok so recently have this issue where my eyes feel pressure and very stretchy. i think i have depersonalization disorder which i feel like i am dreaming and that i feel like im floating. my eyes feel like they are floating and unaware even though they are wide open. i dont have any vision problems, just this sleeping, stretchy, weird feeling in my eye. its been 2months since this first occurred. i have already went to a doctor to get this checked out but i didnt explain to her clearly which resulted her not knowing where to check. my eye pressure is normal, my eye ball is normal, just about everywhere in my eye, she says its normal. but she doesnt know why am feeling this. so i then resorted to searching my own answer online trying to find something that will relax me. all i found was a s**t ton of diseases and cancer which only made me even more scared. i am so f*****g desperate, even my parents dont give a s**t because the doctor said i was normal. do you guys know why am experiencing this? help. i am only a 13 year old. i cant take this amount of pressure and anxiety.

Conjunctivitis,Peripheral shadow after Macular Pucker Surgery,"Had vitrectomy with peel (macular pucker) on my left eye two weeks ago. There is much the docs don't tell you, like my eye would be dilated for up to a week after stopping the eye drops. It's still diolated. The distorted horizontal line is still there but they emphasis that it's wait and see (weeks and maybe months) for improvement. But the thing that is really bothering me is this shadow or curve in the lower left of my peripheral vision. At my post op visit I asked the doc if he missed something in the surgery as I was seeing that ""shadow or floating edge"" (no, I didn't get an air bubble). He said he didn't miss anything and told me that because of the angle limit for the peeling instrument they can only peel so much around the perimeter of my central vision. He said most people see something in peripheral after surgery and told me it might go away and might not. Driving me nuts. Is he lying to me, did he miss something? Will this go away? Is there a follow surgery to clean this up? Help!Had vitrectomy with peel (macular pucker) on my left eye two weeks ago.

Conjunctivitis,"Continuous Floaters, Dark pressure spots,distortions,shadows and other vision problems.. ","Hey, first of all sorry if this may be long but after years of chronic suffering due to my vision and headaches I've resorted into finding a new audience to help me. PLEASE take time to read this if you can even though I will seem like such a difficult case I am going through. So I'm a 17 year old French male currently living in Kenya. About 7 years ago I began noticing that I could not see properly in the centre of my RIGHT eye. It's kind of like a tiny spot of distortion or the spot you get when looking at a bright light but really tiny. I had my first eye exam and nothing seemed to be out of the usual, apart that I could not read from short distances with my right eye because of this spot in the middle. After numerous eye exams following that first year they eventually gave me glasses which I found useless as they never seemed to do any help. I eventually gave up decided to ignore it.. NOTE there was no problem with my left and naturally I can still see with both my eyes as my left eye takes more of the control now In 2012 (12 years old) I was involved in an explosion in which debris ended flying in my eyes. I was taken for surgery and the debris were removed. One year later after that I started developing floaters. These floaters gradually increased for the year and eventually went back to the orphamologist. We addressed the retina and any other thing that could be a cause but nothing came up. Once AGAIN I decided to ignore it and try to live my life ignoring these floaters and this spot in the middle of my right eye. One year later again, around 2014 I began developing flashes and pressure spots in my eyes, meaning when I turn my eye left, right, up or down to the maximum a ""pressure spot"" that looks like the one you get when you press your finger in the eye began showing. There was also a sort of ""dark tear""that appeared in my vision when I pulled of the skin under my eyes down .This is when we decided to go to France to see a doctor. Once again the doctors said there was no problem with my retina or anything out of the usual. We then went to Dubai. There they discovered that there was a burn under my the retina of my right eye that could have been caused by looking at the sun when I was younger. Apart from that no problem with the retina. The doctor there told me that this was not fixable unless they came up with some sort of stem cell treatment in the future. He told me to ignore the floaters and not to focus on them. So I did for the next few years (2015-2016)It was not until 2015 that I began having tension headaches at the back of my head. We visited numerous doctors to check for what could be the cause and did several tests ,MRI, eer, all the ones you would normally do. Nothing. We visited neurogists and they investigated the problems with my eyes and said it could be linked to that. It wasn't until last year that I started devlopping blurry vision when I blink and distortion when I quickly move my eyes around. I'm currently living with chronic floaters, flashes, halos around lights, dark pressure spots when looking left, right up or down to maximum, light curtain veil at the bottom of my vision, strobes and distortion in the peripheral vision at times and blurry vision when blinking. As well as chronic tension headaches. ALL THE SYMPTOMS of retinal detachment yet no retinal detachment or signs of it. Now I know that my story is complicated and there are many gaps but I honeslty don't know how to describe it any better. These problems have brought me so much anxiety and depression over the years because of being constantly told there's nothing even though I am still experiencing these things and vision is not something that can be ignored. It has given me social anxiety and made it difficult for me to learn as Im not able to focus without thinking about these things. Vision is there with you every single time wherever you go and being told to ignorebthese things is quite hard. I've reached a point where I'm having weird thoughts because I can imagine my vision getting worse everyday just like it has for the past 7 years and I search my symptoms on the internet and nothing comes up related to what I have. Maybe I'm just one of those people with a unique case and maybe it just can't fix. If there is someone who has read until here and has heard of similar problems or cases please help, your views would be appreciated. "
Conjunctivitis,Flashes ,"I know I have posted a bit about my eyes but I suffer with anxiety as it is and these are not helping. I am experiencing flashes in my eyes all a variety of colours some white,black, blue but look like glitter because it is quick. Some can be quite strong and again others look like glitter. Does anyone know what this could be? And is it to do with my eyes or could it be something else? Thank you. "

Conjunctivitis,Double vision... but disappears when I read! Why?,"I had a Symfony IOL lens implanted 6 weeks ago. At distance I measure 20/20. I used to have slight astigmatism in this eye, but the doctor said it is no longer there after surgery.Intermediate on the computer is doable as is reading a pocketbook at arm's length - but both are blurry - it's more double-vision with a couple clear, but ghosted images. The phone is not usable even at arm's length. It’s been 6 weeks and I haven’t really had any improvements past day 8 after surgery.OK, here's the interesting part: If I cover my other eye so that I'm fully relying on this one I can just read a book held at nearly arm's length. If I sit and do this for 15 minutes, all of a sudden the text will sharpen right up for a few seconds! Usually if I avoid blinking and open my eye wide, it will remain clear as I stare in amazement until I blink - then it blurs up with double-vision again. Sometimes I can blink rapidly and attain the same effect of clarity.But as I say, beyond these ""moment's of miraculous clarity"", my near vision is blurry as stated initially.I'm not sure this could be caused by astigmatism because I can achieve these moments of clarity and my distance vision is 20/20?Some people say that because the Symfony lens works by bending light to extend the range of focus, it takes time for your brain to ""neuroadapt"" to it... this may explain why I can achieve these ""moments"" of clarity? Maybe my brain just needs more time?My doctor has suggested I need a PCO YAG... but I'm not sure that what I'm describing could be caused/fixed with that? Remember, I'm seeing 20/20 at distance.Has anyone got some insight and thoughts and can comment?"
Conjunctivitis,"Eye Floaters, Ears popping, headaches, fatigue","Alrighty. Never posted on one of these things before. I’m 20, a female, 5’1 and 160 pounds. So I have very bad asthma. It’s not the issue here, but I’ve been on A LOT of prenizone the passed 8 years, I’m on dulera, spirvia, flonaise, and singulair. NOW.The good stuff. In 7th grade I got this floater in my eye. I walked around all day thinking there was a bug flying around, and then it never went away. Just this little black dot. I got my eyes check and the eye doctor was like. “Oh yeah! You have a floater.” And that was the end of it. A year after, I started getting bad headaches. I also was tired all the time. Flash forward to today.. 3 months ago I got really sick with a cold. I woke up one morning with 4 more floaters, all really dark black spots that float around. They’re all in my right eye.I went on a plane ride 2 months ago And since then every time I swallow, yawn, chew, take a deep breath my ears pop. The pressure is mostly on the right side of my head, and it burns! I started having upper back pain a month ago, I’ve heard popping noises in my head (sounds like I’m cracking my knuckles, happens mostly when I lay down) and I’m honestly just done. Its a lot for a young kid to deal with, and now that I’m older it’s a lot worse. They checked my thyroid and my sinuses, both were good. "
Conjunctivitis,Glasses with blue light filter. Are they are ok to wear all day?,"I am longsighted and recently got new glasses. My optometrist recommended getting a blue light filter to help with eye strain from using a computer.

Should these glasses just be used when using digital devices or are they ok to wear all day every day?Thanks!"

Conjunctivitis,My left eye seems to drift off,"I'm a generally healthy 28 year old. Recently I noticed my left eye has been drifting to the left multiple times a day. It usually happens if I'm looking at one specific thing for a while. Additionally, a friend noticed that when I was looking down at my phone, both eyes darted back and forth very quickly 3 or 4 times. I did not notice that they did that, as there was no change in my vision at that moment. It looked to me like I was just looking at my phone. I don't know if these things are cause for concern. I want to get someone's opinion before going to an ophthalmologist and shelling out money I don't have."

Conjunctivitis,My eyes feel sticky and i feel like i have to constantly roll them around,"About a month ago i felt like i had gotten something in my eye like maybe a piece of dog hair since that day i was around one and usually im not. I tried flushing it and got eyedrops and it seemed to help but then about two weeks ago i started feeling like my eyes are just very sticky. Its so irritating that i am constantly rolling them to get very short term relief. Its very embarrassing, and distracting. I thought maybe it was a stress thing or a symptom of my medication (adderall) which i didnt take for a couple days and it still kept happening. Has anyone experienced this? The constant eye rolling is really bothering me and making me feel vwry self conscious. My 2 year old has recently complained about her eyes and so has my fiance."
Conjunctivitis,White eye flashes in corner of eyes when moving side to side ?,"So back in January I woke up to seeing white flashes in the corner of my vision whenever I jolted my eyes from left to right and vice versa. It would be a a small flash and would get less and less bright every time i did so. If I blink it would sort of do a firework flash very quickly as the eye lid covers the eye (if that makes sense). It would occur on and off most days early in the morning or at night after waking and only in dark environments. I went to see the opticians and she said my eyes were very healthy and could see nothing wrong with them.10 months on they still seem to occur with no other symptoms but have slightly gotten better, I'm still wondering what it could be as I still haven't had a proper diagnosis. I was wondering if anyone could point me in the right direction on this ? I read somewhere it's to do with pressure behind the eyes called 'phosephones' or something but isn't dangerous and unable to rectify.I care about my health and especially my eyes so any help would be appreciated. I'm 24 years old so I don't think eye diseases or retinal detachment are common for people my age (I hope) lol.Thanks"

Conjunctivitis,Is this a stye or chalazion?,My eyes where bothering me a lot the day before I noticed pain. They where itchy and kept getting watery making me rub them.

I wake up today with a swollen eye but when I fold my bottom eyelid it’s almost like there’s a black dot a little further back than my eyelashes.

Conjunctivitis,After Swimming I Cannot Tolerate Contact Anymore Please Help!,"Hi Everyone, I’m a recently turned 34 year old guy who has been wearing Acuvue Oasys contact lenses almost full time for over 13 years without any issues at all. Sometimes I even used to sleep in them. In January this year I started swimming in a chlorinated pool every 2-3 days. The first time I swam I carelessly kept my contacts in and some water got under my goggles. A few hours later my eyes began to hurt and I took my contacts out immediately. I realised that I should never have swam in them in the first place, and from that point onwards I always took my contacts out before swimming. However since that day, whenever I went swimming again my eyes would always start to hurt when I reinserted my contacts afterwards. This seemed to happen whether I inserted them immediately afterwards, hours or even days later. It didn’t seem to matter..pain and discomfort would follow. I have not been swimming at all in over a month; yet, the same problem persists whenever I try to wear contact lenses… Pain and discomfort after about 30 minutes that gradually gets worse.. It’s almost like a feeling of pressure that builds up the longer I wear them, but there seems to be no redness or visible irritation. Yesterday I had my eyes thoroughly examined by my optometrist (a new one) who informed me that my eyes are in good health but that they are very dry and that they must have been this way for a long time.. I’m not sure if this correct as as I said earlier, this problem only started a couple of months ago and I have never experienced any dry eye symptoms before.. I have never even used lubrication/dry eye drops before as my contacts were always comfortable enough as they were. I have also tried using a number of different brands and types of contacts including daily lenses but nothing seems to help. I feel as if somehow the chemicals in the pool have damaged my eyes as it seems just too much of a coincidence for me to go from wearing contacts very regularly to suddenly not being able to wear them for even an hour without discomfort. Does anyone have any thoughts on what has happened and if this problem can somehow be rectified? Would seeing an ophthalmologist be a good idea? The thought of never wearing contacts again is a bit depressing as I am so used to them and do not like how I look in glasses. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"
Conjunctivitis,hi im needing some advice on 2 eye issues if anyone can help? :),"ive been experiencing eye flickering at the bottom of my right eye corner for nearly 2 years now it doesnt affect my visian although i wear glasses for distance the last few years, the flickering is annoying but not painful or in the way of my vision. I was refered to an otholmologist last year by my gp, a small retinal tare was found but nothing to worry about as its so small. I was told to look out for any suddern flashes etc as that would be a sign of detatchment. I dont really know what else to do now as its still there? any ideas, could it be eye strain i look at a computer screen every day or tv/mobile or a form of migraine lack of sleep/stress?The second issue is my step dad suddenly went blind 10 years ago and has optic nerve damage, ive searched everywhere to see if theres any new treatments being developed but moorefield etc dont seem to have any promising treatments. We dont really want to go abroad to try things that may not work and cost a bomb or build his hopes.thankssarah"
Conjunctivitis,Fluid Build up at the back of the eye,What causes the fluid to build up in the back of the eyes? what should I do to get rid of the fluid from my eyes? What should I do ? Any person have the same problem as I have Please let me know and thanks for your advicein advance.
Conjunctivitis,Serous Retinopathy ,"Last year I was diagnosed with serous retinopathy, not central but in my proriforal vision. I had a small circle of gray in the bottom right section of my left eye which distorted my sight, eventually leading to a lack of vision in that area. It seems I buck the trend as the most common person to suffer from this is an elderly man and I'm a 33 year old woman! I was told this is more than likely caused by stress. At various points this year I have felt the symptoms reappear, only to disappear as quickly. Is this realistically ever going to go away or is it something that will keep returning when anxious? Also, is the problem likely to move to my central vision?Thanks"
Conjunctivitis,Red eye past 3 weeks!,"It started with slight redness and sensitivity to light 17 days back. It followed with severe pain, swelling, redness, itchiness in the corner when it became unbearable and I visited a GP. On her suggestion I started applying Optrex infected eye drop and ointment for 5 days and Ibrufopen and paracetamol-codeine 400mg until the pain stops. No changes after following what I was told. GP is not referring me to an optometrist saying it conjunctivitis and it will go on its own. It has been 17 days and very difficult to live with red eye. Any suggestions/insight to what exactly this infection is all about? What can be done?"

I visited 3 ophthalmologist, all said my eyes are ok healthy. The situation is controlling me. Even my partner is leaving after 11 years because I got sick with this we never had problems as couple, very unfear after I always helped him with his medical problems. Now I'm adding one more problem to my situation ?. Also I wear contacts for 16 yrs, my prescription changed because in my 40s now and the floaters, I'm getting used to bifocal contacts but I can't get right some how, so looks like I'm going to have to use permanent glasses and this is another killer, I never wear glasses ? I can't believe how my life has changed in 4 1/2 months... Any advise? Support for me? I'm hopless ???"

Conjunctivitis,Migraines and referral from Optician ,"I’ve been having migraines now for four weeks - I’m 27 years old. Initially was having them every day, but last two weeks has been every two days. I have a four month old baby so finding it hard. I get the aura and then the pain, although last few attacks, the pain has been considerably less. Maybe due to taking sumatriptan and beta blockers (as GP put me on these to help control the migraines). A few weeks ago I was rushed into hospital and was in resus for five hours. I had a migraine which was so painful, my body decided to rest what it didn’t need. So I forgot who my husband and son were, was unconscious a lot of the time and couldn’t speak. The doctors rushed me into a CT scan (to check for bleed on brain) and gave me a lumbar puncture (to check for meningitis). All came back clear. They were even getting ready to send me to the neurosurgeons at a larger hospital close by. Once tests came back clear, they discharged me. I went to GP following the hospital trip, where he gave me the beta blockers and sumatriptan to help the migraines. I decided to go to the opticians to check whether I needed stronger lenses (I wear glasses and contact lenses daily). It only increased a little. The optician shone the light in my eyes and found swelling at the back of my left eye. She wrote a letter to my GP asking whether I needed a referral to an opthomologist. GP said she should have referred me straight there. He sent the letter on to the opthomologists. So I’m now waiting for this appointment with the opthomologist. But I’m so worried. Has anyone had anything similar? Or know what could be wrong? I’ve been having difficulty reading since the migraines, but not sure if that’s due to the migraine hangover effect, which I’m constantly getting due to the regularity of them. My eyes have also felt like they’re going crossed eye but I can’t control it and the room spins. Only lasts a minute or two though. Any help would be much appreciated.Thank you. "
Conjunctivitis,Chloramphenicol eye drops side effects?,I was prescribed .5% chloramphenicol eye drops as a precautionary measure after my eye got in the way of a tree branch!

Conjunctivitis,Eyesight distortion,Been looking at previous posts that discuss having the same symptoms. Not any solutions though. My left eye went blurry about a week ago. Went to optician who couldn’t see anything obviously wrong. Am going back tomorrow to have pupil dilated so he can have another look. Eye hasn’t improved but got no worse. If I look at a straight edge (window frame) with right eye it’s purfectly straight but with the left is distorted and all of the sight from this eye is blurred. Has anyone come up with an answer on here?
Conjunctivitis,Endless cycle - Upper eyelid inflammation,"For around the last 3 months I have been dealing with an issue with my eyelid.When it started I thought it was just a tiny scratch on my eyelid that was healing but I don't think this is the caseIt is stuck in an endless cycle; it starts off as inflamed and wet, after a day or so (usually the next morning when I wake) I find that my eyelid is sticky with occasional burning with yellowish scabbing which keeps on developing, once the skin starts to 'heal' it goes dry and starts to peel so I usually put some moisturiser on it to stop it from drying out. After the peeling has gone or is nearly gone my eyelid looks a lot better but still looks darker than my healthy one. After it starts to look better and promising it goes right back to the start with being red and wet..I've looked online for a while and cannot find any information, I do not think this is blepharitis as it doesn't affect my eyelash area of my eyelidI will attach some pictures to give an example of the first two stages"

Conjunctivitis,Shimmering/flickering side effects,"I had a tear in my retina located on the upper right side of my eye; it was treated with laser 3 months ago; furthermore the doctor said tha he applied laser 360 of my pheriferical tear because he noticed it had become thinner, after that I began to see shimmering/flickering on my upper and lower vision. I am 50 years old, I’m doing as much research as I can to find out if anyone with similar side effects has seen any recovery and if so in how long did it take to go away. I live in Mexico and have chatted with a couple of people in talk groups who have experienced similar side effects after getting this procedure done, also I was never warned of anyside effects. I have not yet to chat or find any one who has completely gotten rid of it, any suggestions would be highly appreciated! "
Conjunctivitis,Headache and blurry vision,"I am 24 years old. I am wearing spects from when i was 9 year old. My eyesight power is also very high, -6.5 and -7.

Conjunctivitis,Eye floaters,"So I have had an eye floater for a few weeks and got it checked out 2 days ago, but still worried about my flashing I see and the slight discomfort. I don’t know why I am still worrying when I have been told it’s okay. My flashes are either white or blue glittery type if I stare at a blank background. I do have some kind of anxiety, that’s why I am still probably worried. Has anyone been told this and still got the flashes and floaters? Thank you"
Conjunctivitis,"Sparkles, Afterimages, Photophobia","About 2 months ago I noticed a small black spot in my vision that, unlike a floater, is in a fixed position relative to where I'm looking. I saw an optometrist who did a dilated eye exam, and he found nothing. Just days after the test, I started experiencing afterimages that are more intense than usual, as well as flashes of light in and around the center of my vision. On top of that, when looking at a bright light and then closing my eyes or looking away, I get dozens, sometimes hundreds of small, usually blue sparkles appearing in that afterimage. The sparkles last for a few seconds, then fade away. Red lights can cause hundreds or thousands of blue sparkles to appear, while a soft yellow light in a room will cause only dozens. This number varies with the intensity of the light and the color of the light I'm looking at. Looking outside also causes them. Currently I'm also experiencing visual snow, something my doctor said I'd experience if I had giant cell arteritis. That doc appointment was for a headache I had for 6 months that never went away until 2 months ago, before seeing the eye doctor. So, as you can imagine, I'm worried about having GCA, even though I'm about half the age that it usually occurs at, and if I do have it, it's the slowest progressive case of it I've heard of, so that's relieving as it means I probably don't have it. But still, the sparkles are there, with visual snow and high sensitivity to light. Can anyone relate/help me out? I'd really like to get an idea of what could be causing these sparkles that appear inside afterimages, which are my main concern. Thanks."

Conjunctivitis,"Sudden, temporary partial blurriness?","So I'm a 28-year-old female in generally good health. I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks, but have been told I'm otherwise healthy. I don't think I've ever had an eye exam, but haven't ever had issues with my eyesight.I do have those squiggly floaters when looking at something bright, like the sky. I always assumed they were normal but recently discovered that they could mean something worse, and with my health anxiety I'm concerned. I also have recently had a strange moment where part of my vision went blurry. It made reading difficult, but I could still see. It lasted for maybe a couple minutes, but just as suddenly as it happened, it went away. I remember something similar happening months before as well. It was while I was driving and I started to panic. It was like I couldn't see my left hand on the steering wheel from my peripheral vision, but I could see the road fine. I was ready to pull over when it went away.What could this be? Is it something serious? I'm thinking of scheduling an eye exam soon, but should I be looking into going as soon as possible?"
Conjunctivitis,I am 27 and eye power is still increasing.,I am so very much worried about my eye power increasing every year. I now have 6.5 in left eye and 5 in right.

Conjunctivitis,Contact problem,"Hi, so about two days ago I was on the bus back to school, im 17, and all of a sudden my left eye hurt like something flew in it.

So right now I'm wearing my glasses, and it feels better. It does hurt only a little bit when I blink harder then normal, which i have a bad habit of doing. Also when i looked at the contact there were no tears that i saw. I should mention the eye in question had a cornea infection about four years ago(when I first started wearing contacts) but it was takin care of.

Conjunctivitis,Ordered new glasses but think there could be a problem...,"I am 34 and have had trouble with close up vision since I was 20 (farsightedness), but fairly recently my distance vision has become a bit blurry as well. I just ordered some new glasses from a glasses store which I have never been to before. They did not retest my eyes as I already had a fairly recent prescription from my usual optometrist (R+2.75 and L+2.00), but I did mention to them that I was now having problems with my distance vision as well. I remember her telling me that she was going to do something to my lenses to help with this but can’t recall exactly what.A few days later I noticed on the form they have ticked the box ‘Distance’ (the other 2 options are ‘Near’ or ‘Single Vision’). This confused me as although my distance vision is now a problem too, my close up vision is my biggest issue. Should they have ticked the ‘Near’ box instead? or should they have ticked both ‘Distance’ and ‘Near’? I did call them to check but they were quite dismissive and said it ‘should be fine’. I’m concerned that these glasses may be more catered toward distance vision and not close up. Does it really matter which of those boxes were ticked or is it really just the prescription that really matters?Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated."
Conjunctivitis,New to wearing glasses/contacts not sure if my script is correct?,"It had been 20 years since I last had an eye exam. I had noticed things at a distance were harder to see, digital signs/boards gave me double vision, I was squinting more...so broke down and went to Walmart Vision Center for an exam. They did a quick exam and sent me out to find frames and said farsighted. Gave me a script of:Left Eye +0.50 -0.50 95Right Eye +0.50 -0.25 85I ordered glasses and went on my merry way wearing my glasses all the time. Took some getting used to as I never had any sort of corrective lenses before. Then I decided I wanted to get contacts. So I made and appointment with an actual Optometrist that I take my children to and that was convered by our insurance. With this I got a comprehensive exam that was much more in depth than my Walmart exam and she even did a dialated Eye exam to relax my focusing muscles to get an accurate script. Had lightly mentioned my script was probably more like +1.25 but they were gradually working me up to it? She changed my script from the one I received from Walmart to: Right Eye +0.75 -0.50 77Left Eye +0.75Bought another new pair of glasses and also got daily contacts that were +0.50 for both eyes to try. The glasses are fine, things look clear for the most part. Distance is still not exactly clear but better. With the contacts in anything close is clear and good but distance is definitely blurry. Could the script for the contacts be wrong? Haven’t had my follow up appointment with the contacts yet. Could I need a stronger script all together? Never really noticed problems up close but did notice issues at a distance but the doctor is telling me I am farsighted? I am completely new to all of this, so I am clueless. Should I have her re-examine me when I do the follow up for the contacts? "
Conjunctivitis,Self Induced Double Vision - Young Adult?,"Hi all, For approx last 4 months ive been suffering from horrible double vision, the two images appear adjacent to one another in the horizontal plane, I had visited my Optometrist about the condition, and he advised that my eye muscles may just be weak, but with an updated prescription for my glasses and a few exercises it should go away.However, i feel i am forcibly causing my eyes to go crosseyed, and that if i really strain i can bring the two images back together, as such i constantly have very tired, irritated eyes that feel very sore and water alot due to me overworking them. I also notice the double images more so when im looking the edges of an object.I should add, it is mainly with objects close to me as opposed to things at a distance.Since this has started it hasnt really shown any signs of stopping and has been hugely frustrating, medically i am relatively ok but do tend to sit prehypertensive onto 140/90 commonly, and have suffered from high pitched tinnitus for well over a year.Yet being only 22, and already experiencing this has been really difficult and as such i wanted to get other peoples possible experiences on the matter, have you suffered from this and if so what did you do to alleviate it.Additionally, has anyone else suffered from this, and if so, did Prism glasses help you? Sorry for my long question, many thanks for any replies."

Conjunctivitis,Can't focus on more than one thing with both eyes open. Double/Blurry Vision.,"I've been having some vision problems the past few months, and it's difficult to describe, but I'll do my best... It's almost like I can ONLY focus in on one thing in front of me, and the rest is blurry/double vision, almost like I'm cross-eyed. For example, I have 2 monitors in front of me at work. If I'm looking at both, only one comes in focus, while the other is blurry, and almost starts to overlap the other one. If I'm driving, and I'm looking out the left drivers side window, I can either see the mirror image in focus, the plastic cover of the mirror in focus, or the road in focus. I can't see all of them at one time in focus. I've seen an eye doctor, and he found no issues. I've had an MRI, as well as some standard tests for Vertigo from a Neurologist, and he found nothing wrong. I had an EEG this morning, so i'll have to await those results. Any thoughts? Anything I should bring up with any of my doctors? Questions to ask, tests to take? I feel it's only getting worse. Just an FYI -- I have never smoked, I rarely drink. The last time I had a drink was probably over a year ago, I've never done drugs. Here are the medications I take: 5mg Lexapro dailyPhillips Colon Health 1 pill dailyI was taking Claritin once a day, and a nasal spray once a day, but I've stopped (5 days ago) as I heard that might make my vision problem worse.Any and all help is appreciated!!!

I know what floaters are specs that get in the field.of your vision. I described this sensation to.my doctor and he said floaters. EVERYTHING I've read about floaters is they get in the field of your vision from gel detaching and kinda sitthere. These bug looking things are not that. Its literally like bugs flying around a light they move so fast. What is this? Does anyone else have this? I have tinnitis, head pain, eye strain and other aches and pains in my face on top of this. I'm less scared and more annoyed because I'm getting THE BS answers from doctors who take one look st me. The actual eye doctor said nothing was wrong but this was a few months ago."
Conjunctivitis,Having Vision probem in left eye,"I've been having vision issue's in my left for over a month now. I've seen and eye doctor and an eye specialist and they cannot see anything wrong. I do have wet macular degeneration in my left eye which I know what that looks like. The issue I am having is different. I've had lasik done years ago. What is happening is in my left eye, if I move my eye side to side, I see this blur line sweep over my vision. The best way to explain this is the the line is going over my eye like a rear windshield wiper goes over a rear window where the wiper is pointing down.

Conjunctivitis,Eye Strain From Digital Screens And Artificial Lights,"I’ve got a really strange problem with my eyesight. It’s hard to describe it, so i will try as best as I can, to introduce my issue. There are some electronic devices which screens hurt my eyes. When I’m starring on some screens for more than 5-10 minutes I’m starting to feel confused, it’s also hard for me to mentally focus on anything, I’m starting to have a headache, my heart stars to beat faster than normally and my body temperature increases. There are some screens that didn’t cause any symptoms no matter for how long I using it. From my observations, when I’m staring on the screen that causes problems, I have problems to focus my eyes on the screen it’s especially visible when I’m trying to read text. It’s all began around March last year, when I bought new PC and 25” monitor to it (I used only notebooks earlier, one with TFT LCD LED backlit panel and one with IPS panel (Macbook Pro 2015), which was completely harmless for me and my eyesight). Really quickly after turning on my new PC I realized that something was wrong. I thought it could be problem with monitor, so I returned it and change for different producer, which didn’t make any difference, because my eyes was still fatiguing really quick. I was trying to get used to it, thinking that it could be a problem with just a bigger size of a screen, hoping that problem pass over time. Unfortunately that didn’t happened. I’ve returned second monitor to change it for another one, and another, and another, which led me to the fact that I tested 7 different monitors and symptoms were the same. It’s no matter if i use TFT, CCFL, LED, IPS monitor, it’s also makes no difference how I connected them (VGA, HDMI, DISPLAY PORT or DVI). Over the time when I’m trying to find a solution I’ve realized that the problem is caused not by the display of the device itself, but comes from the software. Any software updates of my main computer (Macbook Pro 2015 - which was previously harmless for my eyes) started to causes the same problem as monitors. I’ve also realized when I’m downgrade the system software of MacBook Pro 2015 to the older one the problem completely disappear. The same thing was with my iPhone 6s and Playstation 4. Problem also appears on some of really old computers. I tried with changing contrast, brightness, frequency of refresh rate, distance of viewing, lighting, also tried monitors without pwm (without flickering) and it’s still not the case, I won’t be able to find any pattern. After about a year of looking for a solution I found only one clue, I’m not 100% sure that it’s exactly this, but it’s mostly reminds my problem and it’s straight connected with my complaints. I found it on a site about Computer Vision Syndrome:""Difficult To Focus On PixelsReading on a computer screen is not natural for our eyes.In contrast to fine prints which have solid black characters with well-defined edges, characters and images on the monitor is made up of tiny dots (pixels).This dots are highest in density at the center and diminish towards their edges.As a result, your eyes cannot maintain focus on them and keep drifting into a reduced level of focusing called “resting point of accommodation”, also known as RPA.But to keep the image sharp, your eyes will strain to regain focus again.This continuous cycle of involuntary retreating and refocusing adds stress to the eyes’ focusing muscles, causing them to fatigue and result in eye strain.""The only difference is that my symptoms starts not after long hours spent in front of computer screen but starts almost immediately and not with all kind of screens/devices.When all of those things began I’ve also started to be hypersensitive to some kind of artificial light. There are some bulbs that hurting my eyes in the same way as computer devices screens, and some are’t. It’s impossible to clearly tell if the problematic are LED bulbs or halogen kind or tungsten light bulbs, or even warm, neutral or cold color temperature bulbs, I’ve experimented with almost everything and still don’t have a clear answer.I’ve been consulted by 7 different eye doctors and 2 neurologist who couldn’t resolve the problem. They claim that I’m fully healthy and in great condition or even better. All of eye doctors diagnosis that my eyes are in great physically condition and after all they couldn’t find any reason of my issues. I regret to tell that in Poland it’s hard to find any high class specialist so after all that it’s hard to believe if their diagnosis is right, especially when I’m still experiencing those complaints. I’m 28 years old, 185cm height, 82kg weight, good stamina, on a healthy diet, lead a healthy lifestyle, never needed to have glasses. My eyesight in natural conditions is and was always in perfect condition.Please help somehow, I will be very grateful for any advice and help"

I've seen a handful of specialist up to a neuro ophthalmologist at the University of Utah (I live in Maine so I was flown to Utah to see this doctor) and they have found nothing that cause my vision problems. I'm really not sure if they diagnosed me with functional vision loss because they really think I have a mental illness causing this or if they are just out of options trying to figure it out so they just made a bs diagnosis. This has happened to me in the past several times in the past 10 Years but always went away within a few months. Every time I've seen an opthamologist and neurologist and found nothing wrong. If anybody has any experience or advice I'd be very grateful. I'll list my symptoms.Blurry vision that varies daily.Spotty vision, I'll look at something and some areas around it will be blurred out.Glare off of objects.Shadow vision.A lot of floaters which may be normal for me I'm just super sensitive to my vision with all this going on.Hard time focusing.Sever anxiety and depression everyday"

Conjunctivitis,PVD.....three years and counting," I was taking Statin tablets three years ago for slightly raised cholestorol after doctor suggested trying tnem,two weeks in I complained that my vision was blurry and the doctor reduced the dosage but within another week I was seeing a cloudy cobwebby mass going through my line of vision in my left eye.I was sent to hospital after being told by my doctors to take no more of the statins,the eye department at hospital said I had had a PVD and told me also no more statins.On asking if they had caused the problem they refused to comment either way.The following week I was at my doctors with very sore eyes and was diagnosed with DES as well now.They told me after examination on that first visit what a PVD was and said the floaters would dissapear by the end of the coming winter,however three years on they have increased causing me another worrying visit to hospital plus another problem cataracts forming in both eyes.After doing lots of research I discovered that the hospital apart from giving out leaflets and advising,water,omega 3,eyedrops,hoping your brain will stop acknowledging the floaters etc etc that its very rare to get rid of them other than biting the bullet and having them lazered or the saline fluid replacement op.Despondent is the word that sums up my feelings.

Conjunctivitis,Epiretinal membrane and double vision. Will a vitrectomy cure it?,"I've had a macular pucker, or epiretinal membrane, in my right eye for three years now, after a posterior vitreous detachment. For the past year it has gradually caused a distortion in my vision, only in that eye - wavy lines and also a difference in image size between my two eyes. This has caused double vision, which is more noticeable when I read or watch television.I have been offered a vitrectomy when I want it - the consultant said it was up to me. This will remove the membrane, but I am concerned about this double vision. Will the operation also cure that? Or will this difference in vision be something I just have to live with?I'd be interested to know if anybody has had this condition and also the vitrectomy."
Conjunctivitis,Who’s gone to a nuro Ophthalmologists? ,"I just made an appointment at the nuro ophthalmologists. I’ve gone to my eye doctor a few times, and they don’t have any answers for me. I went because I was concerned about my pupil being a little more dialated. He said the nerves looks the same, and healthy, and they both react the same to light. He had no concerns. I just can’t seem to shake the feeling that something is wrong. I’m worried I have either a brain tumor or aneurysm. Everyday I feel like a ticking time bomb. What do they do at these appointments? They said it would be around 4 hours long! "
Conjunctivitis,"Still having eye problems,,,,","Two weeks ago I started having vision problems. I didn't have any side visiion, had tunnel vision and was sensitive to light.

I went to the doctor and thwy gave me lots of tests. They said I was fine and I was having an innerear infection. The anxiery went away ans everything went back to normal. Except for my sensitivity llight. I admit I am a shut in and not the healthiest person in the world but outside of having the usual inner ear problems my eyes are fine otherwise. And has gotten better. Except for the light sensitivity which has gotten worse! I can still well but hurtful normal with them off or fhe usual dark with glasses on.

Conjunctivitis,recurring eye inflammation,"Hello,I just joined this website. I live in the USA, in the state of Pennsylvania. Here my issue: For the lastfour years I have had recurring eye inflammation. Every 2-3 mos., I can feel it coming on, usually in only one eye at a time. The iris of my eye would get red & it would be tender to the touch. The pain is moderte, but still very annoying to deal with. I have gone to my eye doctor, he can't find the reason for this. He says my eyes are healthy when he looks into the inside of them. He has given me Zylet eye drops, a steroid/antisceptic which clears it up in about a week or less. I have searched the web for the past year trying to find what might be causing this condition. I have recently stumbled across some information that links inflammatory bowel syndrome with eye inflammation. (I was surprised to find that this could be linked to the eyes!). I went to a GI doctor recently to see if I have IBD, but was told that I don't have this after some testing. But, I do have IBS, and a quesy stomach. Does anyone have any insight into what may be going on with my eye problem? Is there a connection between bowel disease & eye inflammation? Thank you for any information! Linda "
Conjunctivitis,Weird eye problems lasted a number of years ,"Hey this is my first post on something like this and the only time I've properly mentioned it in detail so please bear in mind this has took a lot of confidence for me to post this. For a number of years now (maybe 4 or 5) I've had these spots in my vision. They are hard to describe sometimes they are like yellow or green sunspot type of thing, they can be worse then other times and they seem to be sometimes like flashing but I can't describe. There is more at times than others and I will always see something that's just seems to be there in my vision although these almost seem invisible like I can't see anything but it's like there's something there. It depends what I look at I guess. (Like transparent dots but not floaters) I can forget and hardly notice them at times but still there will be something there always even though it seem like there isn't? I've never seen a doctor about this because I've been to scared and shy to say anything. They have seem to have lasted for some time, as long as I can remember to be honest. I don't have any vision loss and can see fine and never have anything else like flashes or anything but saying that a few times in the past I've had like , what I can describe as what is like the corner of my eyelid is flickering in my vision. This is rare I've had this and first noticed it about a year ago but just ignored it. (Although worried at the time). It's strange and annoying that I get these and wondering has anyone else experienced similar things or what it could be. I see them when my eyes are closed aswell just the worse times come and go and these are obviously a permanent problem. I've just never said anything and always brushed of the fact I have them and don't understand what it could be. In the past I've looked at the sun by mistake but nothing seriously.

Conjunctivitis,"Is this normal? If so, what is causing me to see this?","Whenever I wake up in the morning and just lay there for a bit without opening my eyes yet I 'see' a 'field' of equilateral very dark green pentagons with neon green glow on the edges. Between the pentagons are very bright white thin lines, but only along about 2 or 3 of the pentagon's edges and then they flash to other edges of the pentagon. The thin white lines keep flashing like that.Normally the pentagons are very small, appearing to have edges of only 1mm, but once I saw the image 'zoomed in'. That time the pentagons were as big as about 3-4mm per edge. What is it I see? Is it just phosphenes? Is it level 3 CEV?

Conjunctivitis,Old eye injury,"Several months ago I had someone shove a bag in to my face and it would have been all been in good fun except that it directly contacted my right eye. It was excruciating and bothersome for weeks but I had no money to get it looked at. Fast forward a couple months and during an episode of pain I managed to pull several eyelashes out from under my eyelid. Still however I have spells where it's all I can do not to scream when I accidentally irritate it, albeit not quite as severe as before. My vision seems to be fine, but my question is this; would it do more harm than good trying to probe and extract what remains myself or say with another friendly set of hands? Now I'll admit I dread having it touched again without local anesthetic, but I can't justify spending the money going to the doctor just so the process is a little more comfortable. I would very appreciate any feedback. "
Conjunctivitis,Flashes in center of vision against bright backgrounds.,"Hello all,Lately I've been experiencing flashes in the center of my vision when I move my eyes from left to right or vice versa. Especially when there's much light in the room. It's not like a white flash but more a black circle right at the inner side of the eye. I'm also seeing it in the very inside corner of sight with just 1 eye open. They're not floaters, I have those so I should know. I figured it could be my nose and the brain has to readjust because there's input from 2 eyes, kinda like the nose also blocks off your sight with the other eye closed. But I'm just guessing of course. What do you guys think it could be? Thanks in advance!"

Conjunctivitis,"Double vision when straining, anxious, exercise","My first symptom started in October 2015 was double vision. April of that year I hit my head pretty hard.I was sitting at my desk working on the computer and all of a sudden my vision went double for 20 seconds. During that month I drank a lot of coffee. I noticed my vision would go double when I did strenuous activities after this. I was doing a lot of push ups around this time and double vision would happen about 10 reps in. It hasn't gone away since. Some days I don't get double vision, other days are worse. Simply standing up from sitting may trigger dv. If I try to pick up something heavy I get a very bad headache immediately and sometimes get dv. Sneezing and straining on the toilet sometimes gives me dv. This year has been worse with the headaches almost every day. I've also been having neck pain and vertigo/dizziness when I turn my head. The doctors really have no idea what is wrong. First I saw an optometrist. And then a nurse practitioner. I got a CT scan and MRI both without contrast of my head. Nothing was found. Blood work was done with nothing found. This year I saw a neurologist who thinks it's migraines. Seeing another nurse practitioner now. I had a CTA scan of my head with nothing found. To me it feels vascular related. But the CTA seems to rule that out? I am convinced it's a brain aneurysm that wasn't caught. Recently I've been trying to take 325mg aspirin if my headache is bad. It seems to help it but the double vision is still there."
Conjunctivitis,See lights flash in vision shapped like veins ,"Sometimes during exertion I will see a light flash, shaped like veins in my eye. It only ever flashes once per time, and always with m heart beat, and never if I'm being sedentary. Iv not thought anything of it till now so iv never mentioned it to my doctor, but I have had an eye exam in the last month and everything came back fine."

Conjunctivitis,"Hello, my right eye started watering in October. First d...","Hello, my right eye started watering in October. First doctor visit P.A, he said I had a cold, take mucinex. After 3 weeks and a whole bottle of Mucinex, my right eye was still watering. Next doctor, M.D., said it was a cold, she gave me nothing. Dry eye, rinse it out daily. Did not work. End of November, I finally have a sinus infection, sore throat, wheezing. December, this doctor M.D., thought I needed cordicosteriods, or in other words a nose spray. I refused. This doctor reluctantly gave me Zithoramax. Heavy duty antibiotic, that got rid of the gross sinus infection, sore throat and wheezing to a point. I decided to get my air conditioner replaced, filters changed each month and air ducts cleaned thinking something inside my home was causing it. Allergies maybe, even though I had never had anything like this before as far as my right eye watering. Not wheezing at all 99.%. However, my right eye still waters in the morning, during working out, after the shower, while I am trying to put on make up, all day long, it looks like I am crying all the time and family, friends and co-workers all wonder what is wrong. Finally, in January (4 months)next doctor M.D., reads my file, and thinks I have a serious bacteria infection inside my sinus cavity. He gave me doxicycline, had me get rid of any old eye drops to stop reinfection, toothbrush, wipe down everything on 4th day. Eye stopped watering. Four months later.. another sinus infection, and the watering eyes came back. I went to an Eye Doctor this time. He put a florencent die in my eye, waited 5 minutes had me blow my nose to see if the blue light could see the florencent dye. He looked down my throat and said, I have a drainage problem with my eyes. The dye was in my eye, not in my nose or throat like it should be. He gave me another doze of Doxicycline. Hopefully this will do the trick. Also, I do have an under activity throid. I am doing research on the relationship to that and watering eyes too. Because this time both my eyes are watering and it has been a month. Wish me luck that this double dose of doxicycline will fix the watering eye issue again. If not, I am thinking maybe there is some sort of corrilation with the thyroid and the infection or lack of drainage. Maybe this can help some others out there. Next, if this does not work I will ask for different thyroid medicine. I am currently taking a low dose of armor thyroid. The natural kind, no synthetics. Perhaps too high for my underactive thyroid or maybe it works too good.... Specutalation, but something has to be the culprit, just searching for answers and giving ideas for others to check out. Hope my situation helps you. Good Luck![i:11a600c896]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:11a600c896]"
Conjunctivitis,Jittery vision and temporary loss of focus. ," At my last eye check-up I was diagnosed with vitreous degeneration. From what I understand it's quite common to see shadows and flashes, but how about jitters/""shakyness"" in your vision, and loss of focus that comes and goes? Anyone else who experienced that?I've been diagnosed with Retinoschisis and retinal cysts a long time ago, so seeing floaters and the odd flashes is something I'm pretty used to. This is a new phenomenon however. Thanks in advance for any input. "
Conjunctivitis,Pupils fixed and unresponsive,A week ago my daughter noticed my pupils were different in size . I Went to a optometrist and he told me my pupils are fixed and do not respond . They have a dull pain in behind them all the time and feel very strained in the day light. Has anyone experienced this before ? I have an appointment with a specialist but can not wait 2 months to find out what is going on .Thank you
Conjunctivitis,"""Floaters"" in both eyes simultaneously","Hello all,I'm a 54 year old male, currently deployed to Afghanistan (Army civilian). Recently I've experienced floaters in both eyes when I wake up in the night or first thing in the morning (never at other times). The floater appears as a ping pong ball size object about 2 feet in front of me, then moves closer before disappearing. As it moves closer it seems to resemble a 'spider unfolding' and grows to about twice the original size before disappearing. Closing either eye, I see the floater in the other. Any thoughts as to what this might be? I won't have access to an eye specialist for about two more months. Thanks for reading (commenting).

Conjunctivitis,Worsening Vision and Trouble Focusing,"Hi all, I'm a 24 yo male, I have a history of nearsightedness, contacts have been -2 and -1.5 forever. About four months ago I noticed my eye sight was weird while wearing my contacts, almost like my eyes couldn't focus on the same thing, with my glasses there was no problem. I started getting terrible headaches and went to my optometrist who changed my contact prescription, just thinking it was a little worse. After a couple weeks, my eye sight was changing even while wearing my glasses and my headaches got so bad I had to go to the ER where they did a CT (normal) and referred me to a neurologist. I had a full eye exam which was normal as well as a visual field test and pictures taken of my optic nerve, all normal. MRI results are normal and I really don't know what else to do. Should I get a second opinion from another eye doctor? At this point my eye doctor just thinks it is strain and has prescribed me reading glasses which don't work unless I hold a page right up to my face. I feel as though my headaches have subsided but my vision is still messed up. It feels like my eyes just can't focus on the same thing. Even when closing one eye it doesn't really help the focusing of the eye. I'm really at my wits end and super anxious all the time.

Conjunctivitis,Misdiagnosed twice,"I've been having a lot of strange vision issues the past 7 months. Of course I've been to an optometrist and opthamologist also two neurologists and they've done dilated eye exams an OCT a fluorescent blood vessel X-ray an MRI of brain neck spine with contrast a lumbar puncture and a 4 day EEG and all they can find is anemia from iron deficiency. This is weird though because I'm not bleeding from anywhere they've done stool samples and urine samples. But after all these test of course now it's blamed on anxiety, and I don't think this is the right diagnoses. When there are a lot of things ruled out and doctors get confused it's universal that they blame it on something quick to get you out of their hair. With opthamologist and neurologist the blame is either anxiety or migraine. They just jump to that. That's why I'm seeing a neuro opthamologist this month. I refuse to be BS'D with the whole anxiety or migraine thing. When my neuro blamed it on anxiety or migraine I told him to prove it, and when he couldn't I told him I want a 2ND opinion. I got one and the dct came in and told me he agrees with the first doctor lol so I have an appointment in Utah at the university of Utah to be evaluated by a neuro opthamologist.

Conjunctivitis,Eye Abnormalities,"Hi. I’m 14.Recently, I’ve noticed some oddities with my vision. These symptoms include a sort of halo around lights in the dark, very subtle pin point flashes of light randomly, and a sort of hallucination when looking at straight lines (the lines become wavy from a distance, such as blinds in a classroom). These symptoms have been frustrating me as, my parents won’t take me to an optimologist and I have absolutely no idea if these are normal or not. Side note(s): I have had the sort of halo thing around lights in the dark for as long as I can remember (early childhood). I also have 20/20 vision as of now. And, the transition from bright lights to dark leaves a weird imprint of what I was just looking at (Let’s say I’m looking at my phone, then close my eyes in a dark room).If anyone can help, please do.Thanks"
Conjunctivitis,Constantly taking gunk out of eyes,"Hi,I have a problem with constant eye discharge all day which is really starting to do my head in. Every half hour or so, there will be green or clear gunk in the corner of my eye. Every few hours or so there'll be gunk at the base of my eye after pulling the skin down under my eye. It feels irritating and I find it hard to concentrate at work. I'm constantly having to pick it out or slide my finger through base of eye. Sometimes it will be very thin discharge at the base of the eye. I know putting my fingers in my eyes won't help, but I feel I don't have much choice.I went to the doctor and he said there was nothing really wrong with them, no infection or anything, he said it's just an allergy. I've had two types of drops which I've put in morning and evening, but still hasn't stopped it. I have cpmputer glasses for work as the screen was straining my eyes, that hasn't helped.I don't know what to do, if I go back to the doctor he'll probably just prescribe some different drops. Does anyone know of any drops/wash which could stop this once and for all? Or could there be an underlying problem? It's been like this for at least a year I'd say, even in the summer.Thanks"
Conjunctivitis,Unequal pupils,"I have Duane Syndrome in my left eye, I was born with it and had a surgery when I was 10 yrs old to cut some ligaments away. My vision has declined more since I was younger but the past 10 months my vision had gotten worse and I noticed I’ve been experiencing unequal pupils that are responsive to light and fluncuate. I went for MRI and we found a Chiari Malformation that I’m having surgery for because I was experiencing symptoms. But no one can seem to figure out the unequal pupils... the only thing on the MRI was the malformation, so what could be causing these unequal pupils?? "
Conjunctivitis,"Things look ok, but in reality, I am over by a foot to the left.","Hello,I thought I would see if anyone knew what was going on with my vision.

When I park, visually, it looks like a park perfect, but when I get out of my car, again, the car is over by like a foot and in another parking space. I have no idea what this means. Its been going on for awhile now and I do have an eye appointment coming up to get new contacts, but I don't think new contacts is going to change this visually shift issue I have. Any thoughts?"
Conjunctivitis,Unexplained vision issues,"I've been through complete hell for the past 6 months! This first started 12 years ago. I was in high school, 15 or 16 years old. Woke up with these weird blind spots throughout my vision. Thought it was an optical migraine because I got those a lot then. But it wouldn't go away. After two days my mother brought me to the e.r. and I got told it was anxiety and sent home. This lasted about 6 weeks and went away. Fast-forward 3 years it happened again. I was home from school on break sitting on our front porch. Looking across the street at our neighbors house I noticed I only saw half the house. Everything I looked at had chunks gone. Not black spots, but it was just non existent. Again, thought it was a migraine and went to lay down, fell asleep for a few hours woke up and it was horrible. I was terrified of these vision problems coming back. This lasted a few months and slowly resolved. I was fine for 2 years. Life was great! I got done with school, got into a great relationship and had a healthy baby girl August of 2010. About March of 2011 I started having vision problems again. This time was different. Things got really blurry, I was seeing double off and on and I had a lot of really spotty vision Constantly but I had some days better than others. I saw an ophthalmologist who said my eyes are great. Sent to a neurologist and had a complete work up. MRI /lumbar puncture/EEG/vep. Nothing was found. Between appointments, about 4 months after this started, thing slowly got better and again, I was fine. But April 2013 it started again. I noticed a pattern, every time this happened it got a lot worse. This time I got it all. Blurry vision , spotty vision , double vision, weak and dimmed vision, eye pain, and whenever I woke up, my eyes would roll around uncontrollably for several minutes. I noticed a huge blind spot that never went away. Usually they would come and go all day. I saw the eye doctor again and I had a retinal hemorrhage. It healed but the blind spot remains to this day. I had a complete workup again with my eye doctor and saw a new neurologist. They repeated all of the same tests and everything was normal. I couldn't work anymore. I was terrified again that I'm loosing my vision. But after this completely overwhelming 6 month, thing started getting better. I was fine until July 2017. I was driving home from work, it was 12am. I noticed I couldn't see parts of the road. I made it home and had a full blown panic attack which caused me to pass out. I woke up at 7am the next morning in panic and got a ride to the hospital. This time I got it all again. Blurry vision , spotty vision , double vision, weak and dimmed vision, eye pain, and whenever I woke up, my eyes would roll around uncontrollably for several minutes. I got sent to see an eye doctor and everything was fine with my eyes. Immediately got sent to a neurologist. He repeated all the testing I've had done and everything was normal again. I noticed a big blind spot in my right eye again, and it didn't go away. Went back to the eye doctor and he found another retinal hemorrhage. He said its due to high blood pressure but the visual issues he still can't explain. So I have two huge blind spots in my right eye for life I guess. I saw my gp and he started blood pressure meds but insisted besides the hemorrhages that my blood pressure isn't causing my vision issues. I also have been diagnosed with severe sleep apnea and low iron anemia with no blood loss. My diet is and always has been iron rich. But the neurologist eye doctor and gp says none of this should be causing these vision problems. I'm still going through it and it's not going away. I keep hoping it will. Again I'm out of work and my life is a mess. Constantly anxious and depressed and just scared.

Conjunctivitis,Blurry vision in one eye and weird remedy - what's going on?,"Hi guys,my vision in the right eye is totally okay. The left eye is not so great, it gets blurry from distance (myopia?). The right eye compensates it of course, so in general my two-eyed vision is fine. But I'm very curious about the left eye. Several weeks ago I found about something super weird. When I cover my right (better) eye and look with the left eye alone, it's blurry like I said. But when I place anything, let's say a finger, very close to the bottom of the left eye, so it just slightly covers the image, my vision in the left eye becomes... perfect! It's even better than in my right eye. Same thing happens when I pull the eyelid from the left side further to the left, but that can slightly change the position of the eye, so is more understandable. How is this possible? Does the finger (or any other object) work like lens in this case? Do you think there's a chance for my eye to see better?"
Conjunctivitis,Eye floaters and others stuff please read!,"About two weeks ago I started getting eye floaters which didnt go away... I went to my opthamologist he advised my eyes looked fine.

Mind you I am blind as a bat. I cant see far at all, it all turns blurry. I just want to make sure this is OK. I mean he said my eyes were ok, I think this could be a part of my anxiety tricking me into thinking it is more then it is.. hopefully..The attached photo is as close as I could find to what I see... except mine looks like it has a weird design in the whole circle...

Conjunctivitis,Would love some feedback on dealing with symptoms from a vitreous detachment,"Would love to know if anyone would share some experiences with dealing with symptoms from vitreous detachment. Mine started a year and a half ago. Quick flashes every so often like a tiny lightning bolt. Some minor black floaters, occasion pin- head black dot and occasional light blue flash. Got the PVD diagnosis. Got much better after a year. Two weeks ago it started up again. Panicked it was a retina issue, went to doctor and he said all was fine. Possible residual vitreous issues. Now I am concerned it will never go away!! I am a very anxious person when it comes to health issues and I am wondering if the stress could be contributing as well. Would love some feedback.

I went to the optician and had a thorough eye test including having my eyes dilated etc., and the optician said my eyes are fine. I am a worrier and can't help thinking the worst. Would like some reassurance!"
Conjunctivitis,Eye still red from corneal abrasion after 2 days ,"A price tag attacked me Friday night while trying on a shirt and went right in my eye. The pain was evident and I knew I probably scratched my eye. Went to the ER and got some eye gel and he confirmed a small scratch on my eye. The next day the pain wasn't much better but yesterday the pain was gone and all I had was sensitivity to light and some tearing along with a super red eye. But today (day 3) my eye is still red! Sensitivity to light seems to be gone, and the blurriness has cleared up a lot (not completely). I am just wondering how long until the redness should go away?? Thanks!

Conjunctivitis,Astigmatism,Hi! I had my very first prescribed glasses. The doctor told me i have astigmtism. My vision is blurry. I cant see any faces. Powerpoint presentations in lectures were caused of my headaches. And my eyes are very sensitive to light. But when my classmates and friends try my glasses they said that it seems that it was normal for their eyesight and accused that i am wearing it for fashion not like the other kids in school that if they look atbtheir glasses they will see a difference. My glasses already reduced my headaches and presentations are not troubling me anymore. Is it normal for them to see my glasses as ordinary if they have no astigmatism? 
Conjunctivitis,Please Help - Light is smeared when eye blinking - ,"I did surgery for the removal of glasses nine years ago ( PRK ) , everything was fine, one morning I got up and felt that i had floaters in my 2 eye.I was examined and the retina was Good according to the photographs ( OCT ) and the eye doctor check ans tell me that my retina is good right now.But a phenomenon I noticed that I have not been through for 3 months, when I blink, the light is smeared down in both eyes, both day and night, the wetter the eye, the stronger the light, does anyone encounter the phenomenon? I have been to many ophthalmologists but have not yet overcome the problem. Can a corneal distortion be created? I was told that my cornea was transparent, a normal lens, a normal retina.Your urgent help is already at a loss.I Upload the image that you can see what is see i my both eye when i blink Thanks !!!!"

Conjunctivitis,Is it safe for children to undergo laser eye surgery?,"I was worried that perhaps something must be up with my little girl’s vision. At the age of 3, I noticed that she was struggling to see some things. But I didn’t care it that much. She usually sits very close to the television. I often scold her for that. She blinks her eyes excessively and rubs them frequently. I was unaware that my child was struggling to see clearly. And she never told me that she was facing this difficulty. Now she is studying in 1st grade. One day her class teacher phoned me and told me that my daughter’s notes are incomplete and that she is not doing her homework. I asked my daughter about that. Then only I came to know that she was not able to see what is written on the blackboard clearly as she was sitting on the last bench of the class. She also told me that she faces difficulty in seeing distant objects. We took her to the optometrist the next day. After a complete checkup, the doctor told that she is suffering from Myopia - nearsightedness. The doctor prescribed for glasses. She started wearing glasses. But when she went to school, other children started teasing her. Now she doesn’t like going to school.I don’t want my child to wear glasses. I searched different blogs and came to know about the laser eye surgery ( http://jenkinseyecare.com/procedures-technology/lasik-procedure/ ) . I want to know the details of this surgery. Is it safe for a child of her age to undergo this surgery? Kindly share your views. "

Conjunctivitis,"Swollen eyelids, flaking skin, itchy, red",Long story short I had I had eyelash extensions for the last six months. A few weeks ago after an eyelash extension fill woke up with completely swollen eyes. I ended up going to urgent care where they prescribed me five days of steroids. I immediately took the eyelashes off and within a few days my eyes cleared up. However the last two days my eyes sudden got swollen again and extremely itchy and red and the skin on my eyelids and corners of my eyes as well as below my eyes are flaking off with skin. My actual eyeball is not red or irritated. Allergy medications do not seem to help and any sort of moisturizer or Vaseline I put around my eyes doesn’t help the flakiness. No idea what this could be caused from but it is very ugly to look at and uncomfortable!

Conjunctivitis,Pvd and shaking eyesight ,Hi I’m 37 and have pvd in left eye. I had it in my right eye 3 years ago which resulted in a retinal detachment. I was born with sublux lenses and now it’s like my eyesight is shaking. Is this part of my pvd?

Conjunctivitis,Healing and Recovery from Detached Retina,"Hi All,I had a retinal detachment that included the macula in late September in my right eye losing most of my vision. I got in as an emergency within 24-48 hrs of detachment starting. My eye doctor injected a bubble with the pneumatic retinopexy procedure and two days later did cryopexy to secure the retina in place.He says the retina looks great and healing very well. The bubble finally dissolved yesterday after a good month. I was hoping my vision would better with the bubble gone. Vision is 20/30 but still slight distorted, wavy and objects are about 15-20% smaller than my good eye.Any thoughts/experiences on how long it may take to get back to normal 20/20 vision? I hope it continues to improve over time, but if it doesn’t I’m very thankful to regain most of my sight...Best,Joe"

Conjunctivitis,What are the symptoms of retinal tear or detachment?,"I'm 17 years old and I've had flashes in my left eye's peripheral vision for almost 2 years now with no additional symptoms, I didn't worry about it before because the flashes were very scarce, sometimes I'd not get them for months and something just few times a month and it didn't bother me much so I didn't give it much thought, last week after seeing a flash I tried to learn more about it and did some searching and I've been freaked out since then reading about retinal tears/detachment causing flashes and blindness, now every time I see a flash I get a panic attack, I have OCD and I can cause myself symptoms that doesn't exist and since last week I keep thinking/feeling there's something wrong with my left eye and there might be something wrong with my retina I was just wondering what are the actual symptoms you had when you suffered a tear or detachment? It might ease my worries I don't have any floaters and don't get these flashes frequently, sometimes once a day and sometimes once a week and no other vision problem, my vision is perfect with no blur or anything, if somehing serious was wrong with my eye I would get more symptoms right?

Conjunctivitis,"Irritation in only one eye when wearing contacts - itchy, drooping. Been going on for months.","Hi, I've been a contact lens wearer for many years and have good hygene with them, taking them out and washing/soaking every night. I've never had a problem, until now. Around the beginning of June, I had some irritation that just wouldn't get better in one of my eyes. It felt like there was something in my eye and I had to rinse out my contact, but that just didnt work. The irritation starts off as the feeling that something is in my eye, then the top eyelid gets itchy, and then I notice some significant drooping/swelling of the top eyelid in that one eye. If I take out the lenses, I still have the irritation for about a half hour before it gets better. With glasses, I am completely fine, except it does sort of feel like something is in that eye, but only very faintly.I wound up switching to glasses for a day or two and then tried contacts again, but that one eye still had an issue. I saw an eye doctor for an unrelated matter and he thought it was just allergies (Zadator drops did not seem to help). So I kept glasses and kept trying out the contacts but nothing was making it better. About 4-5 weeks later, I went to my normal eye doctor who was also not sure what it was. He checked for anything under my eyelid several times and didn't see anything there. He had me use my glasses only, switch to a new pair of contact lenses again, and use some wetting drops for a week. After that week, I tried contact lenses again and it all seemed to be better. Unfortunately, that only lasted a week. Here I am now again unable to wear contact lenses without serious irritation in just one eye. Does anyone have any idea what this could be or what to do about it?"
Conjunctivitis,Chronic eye problem: Severe stinging remedied by rinsing eyes. ,"I've had a problem with my eyes several months, I've seen doctors and eye doctors and neither were sure what it could be, one said allergies and the other said dry eye respectively but after taking antihistamines and using eye drops neither have helped and I'm not sure that either of these are correct. What happens is my eyes will start stinging horribly multiple times a day, I rinse them out and they are fine for a while until eventually it happens again and I have to again rinse them out. When using the eye drops a few hours after having rinsed my eyes out the stinging comes back immediately. I'm assuming something from my skin is getting into my eyes, oil maybe because I don't put anything on my face.Are there any eye conditions that come to mind that rinsing would provide immediate relief for? My eyes are also very red whereas before they weren't. The red veins are very prominent, I'm assuming because of all of the irritation. Will this eventually go away when the problem goes? If not, is there anything I can do to get rid of it? I look like I've been binge drinking for 60 years and I'm 28. Please help me. "
Conjunctivitis,Eye scare. Am I going blind in my left eye?,"I woke up in the middle of the night to find out I wasn't seeing out my left eye but there was nothing obscuring my vision (in the dark). I even tried seeing if it was really an issue and I wasn't imagining it by closing my right eye and alas, I couldn't see. I panicked and turned on the light to go check in the mirror, however, when I did this, I could see! Right now that it's morning however, my vision is kinda blurry in that eye. I'm only 18 and I've had problems with my eyes regarding light sensitivity since I was young but I don't wear any prescribed glasses. It doesnt help that I'm also constantly looking at my phone screen, computer screen, tv screen, etc. Should I be scared right now for my left eye especially?"

Conjunctivitis,My dad is having surgery today - ,"My dad (71y/o) is having surgery today for a macular hole. He found out only 2 days ago that he would need to do 5 days face-down posture, so he has not had long to prepare. His ophthalmologist did not mention it. I'm worried that sleeping on his tummy will cause major back problems! Even just during the day, constantly holding your neck in the face down position must be very straining? He talked to someone who has had the surgery, he said that hiring a physio table with a hole for the face was not helpful, and it can be better to just prop yourself up with pillows.. Has anyone got tips or tricks for sleeping or for just resting during the day with face down? I have read all the threads in here and everyone has been so helpful but I'm just wondering if anyone has any specific tricks that really helped when trying to keep your face down?My dad also has sinus issues (often congested and gets sinus infections), and has chronic fatigue. So I am really worried that this recovery time will be very hard "

Conjunctivitis,Extreme Eye Stiffness,"I spend arround 10 hours a day in front of a screen. For the past years I feel my eyes very tired to the point now i just feel comfortable with them closed.What concerns me the most is how hard it is for me now to keep my eyes open like there is some kind of force pulling my eyelids down. It's not a sleepy feeling but more like my eyeballs are struggling against the surrounding muscles.When I look up/down or sideways I feel my eyes/muscles very stiff and have the feeling I can only look half the way in those directions and if i hold my eyes up for example for like 10 seconds I get dizzy and very confused when eyes get to the center.I have this stifness in my eyes from the first moment I wake up instead of feeling rested and relaxed eyes.If I pull my eyelids and surrounding muscles up (with the use of my fingers) I feel very relieved and my eyesballs can move freely almost without that stiff feeling."

Conjunctivitis,My doctor doesn't know what is wrong with my eyes.,"Hi, I have never written one of these before but I am at my wits end! Around three weeks ago my eye began to become red and sore. I thought this was just dry skin but as the day went on it started to look more like a stye under my right eye. I cleaned and baved it when I got home from work but then next day both eyes were swollen, but my left was worse. It was swollen all the way up to my eyebrow and all underneath causing bags. The skin as red and inflamed, and it also started flaking which made it hard to cover/ even moisturiser didn't work. Over the last two weeks I have been to the doctors five times, optitians once and pharmacist. They have given me to start with two different types of antihistamine eye drops, and a ointment called golden eye, however these just made my eyes burn and water even when my actual eyes never hurt only the eyelid. I was then given an prescription antihistamine at the highest dose, and I thought this was working until two days ago when my eyes did exactly the same thing. Started off a little swollen, to then be followed the next day by intense swelling and redness, although this time the redness was even worse! I rang the doctors and he had no clue what to suggest, so he said the next time this happens I would have to be referred to an eye specialist (whether or not this actually happens I don't know!). They seem to have ruled out blephatits as I asked if it could be this after researching but they said its unlikely and they seem to always suggest its an allergic reaction. I have come to the conclusion is may be that or contact eyelid dermatitis as the issue usually happens two days after I've worn eye make such as eyeshadow, mascara, fake eyelashes - the works! If anyone has any ideas what this may be you would be my life saviour as I am never off the internet atm as it seems like a hopeless cause.

Conjunctivitis,Laser Repair of Retinal Tear,"Just had a horseshoe flap tear on my right eye repaired two days ago. Ever since, my vision to the left is a little weird, but I only notice it when I look to the right. It's like my nose grew and is sticking out into my field of vision or something. My retinal specialist said the scarring from the repair shouldn't cause any vision problems, but in another forum a lot of people have experienced something similar. My Dr said to call if I get a lot more flashes/floaters, or if I see a curtain. I can't say this looks like a curtain really, so I'm not sure what to think.I did call the Dr's office yesterday and the nurse said since I was just in the day before and the retina was holding, I should be fine. They did offer to get me in to see a regular optometrist, since it was short notice, or they said I could wait until my two week follow-up with the retinal specialist. It's five hours of driving all together (2 1/2 hours eacy way), so I opted to wait for now and just see if it gets any worse.I was wondering if anyone else had an experience like this? I was reading a forum earlier started by a person called Rose....., but I cannot find that discussion now."
Conjunctivitis,Very dry eyes. Did you see a specialist?,"I've had dry eyes for years and used Carbomer eye drops when necessary. However, over the past 4 months my eyes have got progressively worse and are now sore, itchy, inflamed and extremely uncomfortable. I saw my optician, who did a dry eye test and showed that they were extremely dry - 3 seconds on the Tear Break-up Time test. I am using Lacro-Lube at night and am on my second trial of daytime drops. So far, Systane and Carmellose haven't made a great deal of difference.I'm seeing my GP next week and am wondering whether to now ask to see a specialist. How have others coped with this problem? Did you see a specialist? Was it helpful?
Conjunctivitis,Coloured spots of light when blinking?,"Hey guys,I've been struggling with this for the past few weeks. Though i've had a bit of random blurred vision on and off for about a month. My eyes feel very tired & i do use the computer a lot. However, my problem is that when I blink I see little coloured dots/splodges. They only last one or two seconds at the MOST, and they don't float around.They are not flashes of light like lightning which I know is an emergency. But they are not floaters either. They remind me of when you accidentally look at the sun and your eyes are flashing colour and black spots for minutes afterwards. Only, not for minutes. They usually only occur in the evening/at night. Some days I only get one or two and other days quite a few.It's hard to say because once I get them I get anxious and they won't stop until I take my mind off it. That's happened... two times now. I have tried investigating this on Google like you shouldn't. Apparently, some people think it's terribly dangerous and possibly a tumour and I am panicking. Other people say to calm down and cut back on computer use, make sure you're hydrated, etc. I just don't know what to do. I do have a brain condition called Septo-Optic Dysplaxia. I am blind in my left eye so I can't check anything requiring two eyes. My last eye test was 4 months ago with everything being fine. Is this a detached/detaching retina? What symptoms should I look for with that? Could anyone help me figure out what's happening? My sight is very important to me... 
Conjunctivitis,Floaters,"Hi,I’m not sure if this is the correct area but here goes.I have had floaters (lots of little black dots) in my left eye for some years now. These have been annoying but have gradually settled over time. In the last few days I have noticed a slight change.The left eye floaters have changed to an almost transparent worm with a black outline sitting in a very feint cobweb, and only one.At about the same time sitting in a darkened room I have noticed a flashing arc on the very outer edge of the left eye at about the “7 o’clock” position, maybe extending to the “9 o’clock” position. Not noticed in daytime at all.I might add my GP (I am in UK) is away but I have booked an appointment with my optician for 13 Sept for my annual eye examination. This was the earliest appointment I could get.Any thoughts on this please anyone ?John"
Conjunctivitis,Urgent Opthalmologist Referral,"Hello! I'm new to this and was just looking to see if anyone else has had a similar experience. I went to the opticians for a standard eye test (including retinal photography) 3 days ago. I have not noticed any acute vision problems, but I am slightly short-sighted and it had been around 6 years since my last eye test. When looking at the photographs the Optomotrist stated that I have bilateral slightly blurred disc margins and told me that I needed to be referred to see an Opthalmologist urgently, which I found quite concerning. She didn't explain what this could be caused by, but kept reiterating that I needed an urgent referral. She gave me a referral letter which I have now taken to my GP to refer me. Has anyone else gone through this process and how soon did you receive an appointment? And should I be concerned by these findings? I am otherwise fit and well and do not take any regular medications, so this was a bit of a shock! I do get frequent headache, but this has been a long-standing issue and isn't anything new. Many thanks"

Conjunctivitis,"Apparently ""Red Eye"" but isn't it Jaundice?","Hi,So I'll be honest I stare at a computer screen for days on end and i'm sure a majority of people fall victim to these devices... I basically have eyes more a less the same as this persons which has been taken from a simple Google Search.My concern is that isn't it jaundice? If you look closely towards the corners especially the right corner of the eye you can see it's clearly visible of a ""Yellow"" tint.My questions...1) Doesn't yellow indicate liver problems or infection?2) How can you distinguish between jaundice and red eye when they both present a Yellow Tint."

Conjunctivitis,Posterior vitreous detachment ,"I was diagnosed with posterior vitreous detachment in 1 year ago. My hospital in Scotland told me it would take 6 months for my brain to adjust and that the floaters including a weiss ring would disappear. However they never have. In fact they have gotten worse especially over the past two months. I now have two weiss rings in one eye and one in the other. Together with a mass of cobwebs, strings and blobs. Both eyes also have hundreds of tiny black dots surrounded by lights. I have now been referred to hospital as my optician suspects i have cellophane myopathy in one eye. . I am now considering going to a private clinic as my vision is now blurred. Has anyone any advice or suffered from the same problems."

Conjunctivitis,Feel like I'm losing my sight,"Hello,I would value some input from others who have suffered dry eyes.From the beginning of this year until now my eyes have got progressively worse. Dry, burning, sore and slightly bloodshot, but the worst thing is the disruption to my vision. In the morning I literally wouldn't be able to read a thing, and even though it does improve after an hour or so I now constantly have a clouding and aversion to brightness. I can see up close although blurred, the worst thing is trying to look into the distance which is now difficult. It was the optician who diagnosed it, as I initially went due to the deterioration in my sight rather than the feelings in my eyes which I hadn't really noticed at the time. He just told me it's common because we all use computers etc and that I should use eye drops...I went to my GP as I found the drops weren't sorting the problem and he prescribed some ointment.My questions are, should I just accept I have dry eyes and use these products indefinitely or should my GP try to diagnose the underlying cause (if there is one)?

Conjunctivitis,Would love some feedback on dealing with symptoms from a vitreous detachment,"Would love to know if anyone would share some experiences with dealing with symptoms from vitreous detachment. Mine started a year and a half ago. Quick flashes every so often like a tiny lightning bolt. Some minor black floaters, occasion pin- head black dot and occasional light blue flash. Got the PVD diagnosis. Got much better after a year. Two weeks ago it started up again. Panicked it was a retina issue, went to doctor and he said all was fine. Possible residual vitreous issues. Now I am concerned it will never go away!! I am a very anxious person when it comes to health issues and I am wondering if the stress could be contributing as well. Would love some feedback. Thank you!"

Conjunctivitis,Retinal detachment surgery complication,"I was diagnosed with macular hole. Specialist recommended surgery as I'm 50 and still have quite a few years left. With a vitrectomy and a gas bubble inserted, I had retinal detachment with leakage thru the hole between the membranes. I had an emergency vitrectomy with silicon to reattached the retina and an Oil inserted to heal the macular hole. After the surgery , this is my left eye, I have two black blobs in the upper right side of my vision. Dr. told me it either take 2 to 6 week to clear up. After 10 weeks it didn't go away. Dr. decide to give me another vitrectomy with laser and help clear it up. I had this surgery 5 days ago and the black spots are still there when I wake up in the dark. They gets lighter when I'm in the light. I'm wondering if anyone has this problem and if the black spots ever go away. Thanks in advance for any input. "

Conjunctivitis,Floaters worse after dilation drops.,"I had laser for a retinal tear last March and everything eventually settled and I was feeling well. On Monday past I had an appointment with the glaucoma clinic as at one of my eye casualty visits it was flagged up ? glaucoma.

Up until this point I had never any problem whatsoever with my left eye. I am assuming its something to do with all the different drops they put in and the intense bright lights from the different machines they use for testing .

Conjunctivitis,Is this Dry Eye Syndrome?,"Hallo. I have stumbled across this condition as perhaps being what I have, as I had thought that dry eye syndrome would be just that - constantly dry eyes that drops could control. However, what I have been experiencing for a few weeks is this: heavy eyelids, 'scratching' and 'burning' sensation, itchiness, soreness, and some watering within the eye and just on the edge and not being able to keep my eyes open for long because of the discomfort. I put this down to perhaps late developing hay fever, as I have been gardening (I have NEVER had hay fever - I am aged 66) - however, it doesn't always happen when I have been in the garden. I generally wear glasses, and only wear contact lenses if I am going out, so haven't recently. I cannot see anything in the eyes. I have rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis, for which I take Methotrexate (but I have been on that for over 5-6 years). I also take Amitryptiline, Folic Acid, Amlodipin (for high blood pressure, but is under control) and Atorvastin (for high cholesterol, also under control).Should I go to an optician or to my doctor?Thank you."
Conjunctivitis,Eye problem from the last 3 months.. Please help. ,"I'm a 29 year old female and my current weight is 70 kgs and height is 5""3. Roughly 3 months back I felt something wrong with my left eye.. If I close my right eye then there is a blind spot in my left eye. I can see the central area and the side area perfectly but the area between that is totally blank. My right eye is working perfectly well though. I visited an opthomologist who suggested it might be Csr which might be causing this. He gave me couple of drops and told me to try it for a month. After that I was recommended to a Retina specialist who checked my vision and retina and said both were totally fine. He sent me to a neuro opthomologist who told me to get an OCT, BRAIN AND Orbit MRI, B12 and thyroid check up. Everything turned out to be normal. She said it might be an underlying effect of IIH and started me on diamox. It's almost 2 months now but things are pretty much the same. I visited another Retina specialist who is saying its neither Csr nor IIH. I'm sick and tired of going to the doctors and getting different check ups done which btw are expensive and of no conclusion. I don't have diabetes nor any headaches.

Conjunctivitis,Ghosting Vision (Monocular Diplopia),"Hello everyone,In the beggining of February this year my vision got a bit worse and since then its only getting worse. When I was 16 I used to wear glasses just to improve my vision of my right eye (-3.00), but as it was my lazy eye I stopped wearing them cause it only caused me headaches and I didnt really used that eye. This year, I am 23, and in February I noticed my left eye started to get some vision problems, I started to see images a bit blurry, so I went to the optician and said I had astigmatism and myopia, first prescription was L -0.5 -1.00 and R -3,50 -1.25, I was happy cause I thought the problem would be fixed, but when I got the glasses my vision problem was still there, I could still see a double image of some bright stuff (specially white on black surfaces) and my night vision was sooooo bad... Went back to the optician, they said it might be just a question of adapting to the new prescription, waited 6 weeks, and the problem was still there, went there again and did a new eye exam, this time they gave me a new prescription L -1.00 -1.00 and R -3.75 -1.25, the optician assured me my eyes were healthy and it was everything alright, less than 2 weeks got the new glasses, but the problem was still there.... I decided to go to A&E as I was feeling dizzy and with huges headaches, they did me a ct scan and a MRI, everything is normal with my brain, no tumor, no damage on my brain, no Multiple Sclerosis (as it was an option since my grandmother had it), everything was fine, even the blood tests they made. Last month went again to another optician, again they assured my eye was healthy, just said my pupils are too dilated and it might be the cause of my ghosting. But then again they gave me a new prescription, L -1.50 -1.25 R - 4.25 -1.25. 2 weeks ago went to a neurologist and I am waiting to do some more exams to my eye muscles and blood tests to check for Graves Disease. Does anyone ever had those symptoms of ghosting? Cause I am getting a bit depressed to see my vision getting worse and no real answer....

Conjunctivitis,Axis wrong on glasses? Or is tolerance too high?,"No matter who tests my eyes, or where I get my glasses made, when I rotate the glasses about 15 degrees, I see better. When I tilt my headto the right, I see better with right eye at a distance. What is this phenomenon called---where the eye tends to level itself slightly with the horizon? I'm headed for the optomitrist next week but need the official term for the problem."
Conjunctivitis,Lasik/Lasek Surgery Didn't Help,"I had been wearing glasses for many years and so was excited when I heard about this new treatment. Forget if it was lasik or lasek, but anyway they evaluated me and said I was acceptable for it - long-sighted with astigmatism in left eye. Had the operation up in London and it was great for about 5 years. Then I needed light reading glasses - okay with that. But now I find every time I go to Specsavers, I need stronger glasses so am really disappointed after hearing that news. I DO have early cataracts, but have to wait until they get worse to be treated. I'm sick of eyes at this point and wonder if there is an eye enhancement operation that is safe?Why doesn't vision level off and stay somewhat the same when you get older for god's sake? I'm thinking of my friend who is in her late 60's and simply buys cheap reading glasses - yes I know everyone is different, but I really thought this procedure would work and do so for a lengthy time."
Conjunctivitis,EYE SMUDGE,"What is it when you read and find that certain words are lighter or have a slight smudge on them? When I close my right eye, the left eye sees the print fine.

Would it be refractive error?"

Conjunctivitis,Eye strain with work lighting,"Hello,I've recently moved offices with work and since have had trouble with what seems like eye strain. By the afternoon my head feels achey (I do suffer with tension headaches) but I also feel a bit disoriented and have been gong dizzy- either just feeling a bit dizzy or standing/ walking and feel like my head is spinning and loosing balance occasionally. There are windows behind me so it's glaring on my screen,but we do have blinds now so it's slightly better. However there is still a fluorescent light in my eye line right at the top of my screen. I didn't know if this could be the issue? I asked for this to be turned off several times but nothing has come of it (there's no switch just to do it ourselves). I don't really want to waste a doctors time if it's nothing that can be sorted other than it's just the office I'm working in. Thank you "
Conjunctivitis,"Blurry Vision on-and-off, Terrified, Please Help.","Hello,Since Wednesday morning, when I was awake laste into the night, I've been having patches of blurry vision. Well, I suppose it's sort of a bit... of ghosting, too? It's hard to describe. At first I just thought I was tired so went to bed. When I woke up in the morning it persisted for about ten minutes. I washed my face and all hoping it'd help. In the following 5 days it's been happening about two-three times a day. Apart from Friday and Saturday, where it barely happened and I felt quite good like I'd sorted the problem and rested my eyes enough.It mostly happens just after I've woken up or at night. It's now sunday and It has happened twice today. However, I've now developed a feeling that everything seems a bit hard to put into focus. The trouble is that I am still able to do my college work and household tasks easily and when i don't think about it i have no problems. I am terrified that either a) My vision is suddenly becoming slowly more blurry or b) I am so paranoid I think that this is the case. I have anxiety disorder. I am a hypochondriac. So that doesn't help.However, my vision has always been poor. I am blind in my left eye and only have 6/60 vision in my right. I was born that way, with septo-optic dysplasia. I was told the condition was not degenerative and only two/three months ago had an eye test at hospital that checked behind my eyes and everything was fine. But that was months ago, I suppose.I do use the computer A LOT. Everyday, I'd say, for work or for contacting friends. I have glasses with anti-glare lenses that i've started using to try and help. I know that if it goes on a week I'm going to see my GP but my question is, should I be worried about losing what little sight i've got? My life is based around my sight virtually. I'm a writer, and I enjoy gaming and contacting people online. I am terrified of basically my life being taken away. Even this i am writing right now I would struggle to do. Can wearing anti-glare glasses for the first tmie regularly make your vision a bit weird when you take them off?I'm so scared. Am i going blind? Please help. Thank you."
Conjunctivitis,Retinal tear from head hitting car doorframe,"My age is 34 and I am a software developer. 10 years back I had a minor eye laser done to seal weak spots in the retina. My eyesight is -0.75 (right) and -2.75(left). I have had eye flashes and floaters for past 2 years. Couple of months back, during a routine eye examination, the doctor said there is a minor horse shoe tear in the left eye and he sealed it with laser. I just had dilated eye examination done few days back and everything was normal.Today, while pulling my head out of the rear seat of the car, my head banged with mild force against doorframe. My eyesight is normal, but I am so scared it might have caused a tear or vitreous detachment. Could my vitreous pull from retina and make it weak as retina is attached to eye ball only at few places. I am scared to death and just cannot come out of it."

Conjunctivitis,4 years on... No diagnosis! Right eyelid swelling!,"Hello all, I posted on this forum around 3 years ago explaining my issue and looking to see if anyone has any similar experiences, but thought I would do an updated version now! I'm a 20 year old female, and have been suffering with the same ailment for 4 years.So let's start at the very beginning... (it's a very good place to start)In August 2013 I woke one morning to an extremely swollen right eyelid. The eye was red and itchy too, so we presumed it was conjunctivitis. Tried over the counter medication to no avail, so went to the GP. They prescribed me with antibiotics, which I'm fairly certain did absolutely nothing and paul (affectionate name for the affliction) went away on his own. Around 2 months later it happened again, more antibiotics. They believed it to be pre septal cellulitis for a time. It then happened again just before Christmas and I was referred to the eye clinic at a hospital near me. I saw a wonderful doctor who was extremely friendly and helpful, she prescribed me with FML which is a steroid eye drop, that seemed to work to some extent. I went back on several occasions to the same doctor when it occurred again, and was given the same steroid drops to use. Whilst being treated at the eye clinic over the course of 2 years, I must have seen at least 7 different opthamologists. All of whom were completely baffled by my problem. One doctor referred me to a consultant opthamologist who sent me for an MRI scan. This came back clear, except for a slight swelling of the tear ducts in both eyes, but the doctor told me there was no cause for concern. So, I got sent to an ENT specialist. They had no idea.I then got sent to a Dermatologist, who again had no idea.I then went to an immunologist who again, did not think they could help, as although I suffer from several allergies this affliction only ever affects my right eye. An allergy related problem should in reality be affecting them both.I only ever wake up with this swelling, and it varies in severity. Sometimes it will last only a few hours, and my eye will be back to normal by lunchtime. Other times it can last up to two weeks. There is no way to predict when it will happen, it's not stress related, and it isn't related to me being ill in any other sense either. To put a slight time scale on it, I would say around every 2 to 3 months it flares up. So we're talking nearly 30 times in the past 4 years. It is very painful, and whenever I move my actual eyeball I feel as if there is a tension behind it. However, my sight is as good as it should be (I wear glasses anyhow) and the many opthamologists I have seen, confirmed that my actual eye ball is perfectly healthy. Around a month ago it happened again. It got very bad to the point where my mum suggested going to A&E. I was in extreme pain, and the swelling had spread right to my cheek and jaw. I hadn't been to the eye clinic in around a year, because the steroid eye drops were added to my repeat prescription, meaning I could get them in advance and be ready to use them as soon as I wake up. However, they were taken off my repeat prescription, and of course I woke up on a Saturday with it bad, so we ended up at the emergency GP clinic. They sent us to the eye clinic again, where I saw yet another doctor, and had to explain all over again. She asked to see me again in a few days, and gave me the drops to use. These did not work as effectively as they have before.I returned, and got seen by ANOTHER doctor who asked the same questions and made the same curious noises as every other one has. She gave me a referral to a consultant opthamologist I had seen before. I had that appointment today, and she basically explained that obviously we were having no luck, it's been 4 years, 5 different departments, countless different doctors, blood tests and scans, and we still have no diagnosis. She has now written me a referral to Moorfields Eye Hospital in London. Although she stressed they may have no idea what the problem is either! It seems I am a medical mystery!The only thing that has become apparent in the last year, is that I suffer from pernicious anaemia, and will be receiving B12 shots every three months for the rest of my life.Is there ANYONE out there that has suffered anything similar?"

Ever since the incident my eyes have been through the wars from burning, tearing, stining etc and have been on a number of different drops and sprays etc and am quite happy now with Hylo-Tear to help the dry eye problems. About a month ago I noticed a dull nauseating pain coming from the the outer corner of the right upper eyelid (lacrimal gland I believe) and it really made me feel depressed as could not see anything wrong with the eyes or surrounding area from the outside. I went to the doctor who said that it could be a bit of ""hysteria"" due to all the agony I have been through with these eyes and sent me on my way which I was not impressed with. I decided to then, a few weeks laster, to go to A&E eye unit at my nearest hospital as wanted to get an answer as to what my eye problem is, he took a look under a slit lamp and said that I have ""Blepharitis"" and said to have regular warm compresses, clean eyelids (even though they don't look red and no crusting). I have now been doing what he said but now the same pain that took me in my right eye happened in my left and really pushed me to the lowest of the low. It has eased but I live in fear / panic of the pain coming back in either of both. I want to go back to the hospital but scared they may push me away and say you are just making it worse by panicking all the time. Can someone tell me if this kind of pain is normal with Blepharitis and why has it only started 6 months down the line. Also, is it really ""Blepharitus""; as I don't have any crusting on my eyelashes or redness / dryness of my eyelids at all. They look perfectly healthy. I am really at my wits end with all this and fear that I could lose my job and everything at this rate, as I am just so severely depressed over this "

Conjunctivitis,How to live with sickness and be happy about it(?),"[ No preview available, so bear with the lack of finesse here. ]I have grave cataract in my right eye 95% obscured, and slight cataract in my left eye 10% obscured – no, I have not gone to doctors for my trouble. I am 80 years old in seven days time, but I get along safely in crossing streets, and also reading and writing in the internet, for example reading and writing here in this forum.Recently I have this annoyance, namely, my left eye in particular is watery, i.e. there seems to be viscous secretion, and also my right eye but not as bad as with my left eye, still I get along, and it is annoying but not at all disabling as that I can't see at all.My eyes seem to behave better when I am outside my home like going to the cemetery every Sunday to visit my wife's grave, that requires me to go outside under the sun in the smog and dust outside in the streets, etc., and ride in public vehicles like buses, etc.In particular the left eye will also gather some creamy 'ointment' in the right edge corner where there gathers normally tears... no trouble for me, just wipe it off, and it does not return; in fact when I wake up I find dried crust bits in the eyelid, and I just rub them off with a dry towel gently: because when I try to do more, then I will not see as clearly until the eye gets adjusted itself with me rolling the eyeball in all directions.Sensation on the inner eyelid surface is like my inner eyelid surface is not noticeably comfortable smooth when I roll my eyeball up, down, left, right, etc., or it is the cornea that is not comfortable: but that is no trouble at all, and when I am distracted I don’t even feel it.Okay, I have been reading in the internet about eye troubles, and I found this long article on all kinds of eye troubles in the present website in its section on: Eye Problems | Health | Patient.It is really very exhaustive, but I don't find any mention - still of course I have not scoured meticulously the whole article - of how to live with a sickness and be resigned to it or even happy about it.That is a way what I have read from a few eye doctors who advise that if you can live with your cataracts, don't go into eye surgery to 'cure' the trouble.So, this topic is addressed to patients as well as doctors, because there are people who live much longer with a sickness. but they could die earlier after undergoing a 'history' of medicate intervention to cure the sickens and restore health.What do you guys here say, and I think perhaps I can do mankind a favor by writing a column, on how to live with sickness and be happy about it(?)."

Conjunctivitis,Double Vision lasting for a few seconds ,6 weeks ago I was in work just in office when suddenly I had double vision this lasted a couple of minutes I went to gp and they referred me to an eye specialist. They could'nt find anything wrong with my eyes and said my eyes werent the problem. Anyway yesterday the same thing happened again double vision but only for about 30 seconds.Went back to gp and they are now referring me to neurologist. I am worried sick has anyone else had this happen to them? I know this sounds stupid but I was hoping it was because I need glasses and that was the problem. A friend said it could be a migraine but I didnt get a headache with them and they didnt last long the last one I did feel a bit dizzy with it. Any help or information would be great.I just keep waiting for it to happen again and its stressing me out. I am a 60 year old female
Conjunctivitis,Large dark gray line in my left eye. What should i do?,"This is happened out of nowhere. I was walking on the street and next thing i know, there was a large grey line in my eye where I cannot see anything. I tried to flush out the eye with cold water but there was no effect. If I closed my right eye and only looked through my left, I cannot see the laptop screen but can see the keyboard. It seems whatever I try to focus on, the dark grey line covers it and i cannot see. Its the evening right now and I know most eye doctor offices are closed so I was wondering if I should wait till tommarrow or go to the emergency room. If any of you experienced this, can you let me know how it went. "

Conjunctivitis,Pressure behind eye.,"Hello. A few days ago I had a very peculiar headache. It sounds like a ""ice pick"" headache or cluster headache. Though I've never had one before. Since this short headache a vein above my right temple has been very pronounced and I've had this awful pressure behind my right eye. It's not painful, however the pressure feels like it is getting more prominent and worse. (Almost feeling like my eye is trying to leave it's socket) sounds weird I know.And now this evening half of my right eye has gone completely bloodshot. Straight down the middle. Almost looks like half my eye has been dyed perfectly. Half white half red. Odd. There is some slight discomfort now (presuming because of burst blood vessels?) I am also getting some visual problems. A haze/blur in my poretheral. It's the weekend, so getting a doctor's appointment is impossible. Should I be concerned and go to the hospital this weekend? Or should I wait until next week and get a doctor's appointment.Sorry for long post! And thank in advance for any replies!"
Conjunctivitis,I have Blurred/smudged eyesight followed by a huge headache and I haven no clue what it is. Help.,"so I'm only a teen and was at school,straight after lunch my eye sight went funny, it's hard to describe, it wasn't quite blurry and it was only to the left of both eyes mainly in my left one, it was pretty much a strip of smudged area, it was basically like everything in that area blended into white nothingness. I went on my phone before my teacher came in and was trying to text, It was very difficult because it was like my eyes weren't really registering my left thumb, it was like one of those 3D picture things kind of. I could feel my eye was different/it felt different like when something goes numb kind of. The whole lesson was like that, like when you stare at a blank piece of paper or something and everything else around it just blends in or disappears only in one section of my eye. I have no clue what it was and it lasted 50 mins, maybe it could have something to do with the fact that at lunch I fell out majorly with my best friend and I am very stressed at home i have no clue, but after my eyesight went weird I had a a HUGE headache. Does anyone know what it's about?? It's only happened to me this once and my parents don't think it's anything very serious so I'm not going to the doctors but I really want to know what it's about whether it's an eye condition or maybe brain condition.

Conjunctivitis,metal shard bullseyed my pupil,"HiWas wondering how long after surgery, my eye sight will restore itself.I was paint sparying and got a bounce back and after 2 days of pain had to visit my local casualty dept.I was found to have a foreign body which had buried itself in my pupil.I was referded to see the eye specialist on the same day and he had a go at removing it, but failed and told me to return in 3 days.After 5 visits and my eye picked at, scraped and messed with, the last specialist told me that he had removed it.Although Im not in pain, or even slightly uncomfertable, my eyesight is only 50% of what it was in that eye. Its like im looking through a thin sheet of plastic sheeting and as a decorator, is pretty worrying.My question is, should I just be patient and let nature heal it, visit my doctor for a chat, or go to my local opticians and see what they say. ??By the way, Im a 55 year old male and previously only wore glasses for reading small print.Any ideas guys would be appreciatedThanks"

Conjunctivitis,macular pigment change,"So I went to get an eye test today and when the optician viewed the image of the back of my eyes she said there was a small change in the pigment of the macular. She said it can lead to vision loss. She looked at my eyes, did the vision tests and my vision seems okay, apart from being short sighted. She said not to worry, it may have been there all the time but due to my age (35) they don't really look for it but I am to go back for an eye test in a year rather than two. Well I did the worst possible thing and googled it which of course came back with macular degeneration and loss of central vision, although all I can find is age related macular degeneration but I'm freaking out. Has anyone else had experience of this, is pigment change something that can always have been there without any degeneration? I suppose if it was serious she would have referred me but I'm wondering if I should make an appointment with the GP?"

Conjunctivitis,Twitch/Tremor below left eye,"For about 12 months+ now I have had a twitch/tremor below my left eye, just where the thin skin is just below your eye which I believe may be called the orbicularis oculi area of the face. The twitch is more so a tremor, where when seen in light such as sunlight etc; can be quite visible and it looks like a constant tremor, a bit like a pulsation.I really don't know why this is happening as I'm generally quite healthy and have tried many things to make it go away. I do suffer from low confidence at the moment, but the reason for that is because of the twitch, and if this was to go away confidence wouldn't be so much of an issue. I have tried cutting out vaping ecigs but still no change, and I have also tried tonic water which people say can help. I have tried researching my symptoms online but most of what I find is people with actual eye twitches such as eyelid twitching etc; which is not what this is, as this is below the eye. Anyone else have anything like this? Any helpful things which I can try? I have tried massaging the eye but to no avail. "

Conjunctivitis,Been advised I need glasses but I think my vision is fine,"Hi,I went to the opticians the other day (my 1st eye test in 4 years) and I've always known that I have an astigmatism in my right eye, which is pretty blurry, but always been told that my vision with both eyes is fine so no need for glasses.But at the end of this consultation the optician said that I need glasses for any concentrated work (so I guess computer work, reading etc). Je said that te asigmatism in the right is quite bad, and that i have one in the left also (not as bad). I'm collecting my glasses in a couple of weeks, but I'm just worried that the optician has made a mistake and that I don't need them as I feel like I can see fine. I'm concerned that as I can see words fine when reading, and the computer fine, that when I put my new glasses on it will make it all blurry? I do find sometimes however that if I've been playing computer games or something for a long time, that when I look at words it can have a bit of a blur around it, but I just assume that's because of my eyes refocusing or eye strain or something? I do also find that when I go to the theatre or something, there is also a bit of blur around people, but when I squint, it brings them into focus.I was just wondering if anyone else has been suggested to have glasses when they thought they didn't really need then, but then actually found that once they got them , they did actually help their vision. Might be one of those things where I don't realise I need help with it, until I realise what it should be.Just seemed like the optician rushed my appointment a bit. Probably worth pointng out that I am quite a worrier. ?Also, my prescription was cylinder: right eye T.50, left eye T.25 - Axis was 180 for both, and there's an 'x' for both eyes in the sphere. For distance acuity it says 6/6 for both eyes, and near acuity for both eyes looks like 'n5'. Is this a weak precription?I've never had glasses so I am completely confused.Thanks in advance for any advice. "
Conjunctivitis,Dry eyes / Blepharitis / PVD - affecting my job,"Hi all,?Within the past couple of months, I have been diagnosed with a PVD as well as dry eyes and blepharitis. Apparently, these conditions are not related but, conicidently, came on at the same time. Because of the PVD, I have flashing lights & almost constant floaters. I also have increased light sensitivity, uncomfortable and stinging eyes which I think is down to the dry eyes/blepharitis but the light sensitivity could be due to the PVD I have no idea.?The problem is, when I spend extended periods of time at a computer, the symptoms get worse. I have altered the contrast etc to make it more tolerable and I seem to be able to spend an hour screen time but anything more causes discomfort. Basically, what I want to know is whether this will be a permanent problem? I am self-employed and work in digital marketing so my job is all computer based. Currently, I am unable to work because of this, which is not a situation I can financially sustain much longer. I guess, really, I'm looking for advice/opinions as to whether I should seek alternative employment or if you think this situation will improve in time.Thanks in advance,Cara"
Conjunctivitis,Red Veins in Right Eye - HELP! ?,"I have an ongoing problem that I'm really concerned about. In the past, I was a heavy computer gamer. As a result of always being in front of a monitor all the time with little to no breaks, it has now caught up to me. I have red blood vessels in my eye and it seems like it's permanent.. it hurts when I don't get much sleep or are stressed out. This has been a great concern to me for the health of my right eye mainly, but ultimately both. Help would be much appreciated..Thank you."

Conjunctivitis,EYE FLOATERS.....Please help!,"Hi, it's been a while since I last posted about my GERD or my Acid Reflux last year and I'm so thankful that somehow I feel a bit better now. Occasionally it occur but it's not like as it was before. I was suffering from that one terribly.My my worries right now are both my eyes. I have been suffering from floaters recently. In fact, I don't really know when exactly I had this. I am seeing strings, cab webs like, line of fabrics or sometimes it looks like a tadpole or kind of other organisms shape-like just floating in my eyes and this made me feel so frustrating. Most of the time I am on my computer writing or reading and these floaters are really getting on my way making me really sad, helpless and causes me anxiety and a bit depressed. It really get a hook on me emotionally. I hate to look in a bright or white background even on daylight or looking up to the sky because all the more they become very very visible and so annoying.That is why I hate to look on the walls of our house they are all creamy white including the door. I even close the blinds of our windows most of the time because I became sensitive to light. My husband got annoyed of me sometimes because the house is a bit kind of dark when he gets home.I had this checked up by an ophthalmologist already twice last year and the doctor says I had a dry eyes and a near sighted vision and prescribed me a correctional eyeglass and an artificial eye tear drops for my dry eyes. I experienced hazy or blurry vision, red eyes or red blood shot in the eyes and sometimes a mild to severe pain in both eyes. That is why I had the prescription above but I didn't get anything for my floaters. The doctor says nothing too serious and my eye problem is treatable. And as for my floaters, as usual, the doctor says that your brain will get used to it and that they will settle down in the bottom of my eyes in time--but for when? Only time can tell. I have tried some food supplements but don't know if I'm doing the right thing.As time goes by, I noticed that I am getting more of them now. I'm seeing new floaters coming and I am afraid they might have gotten worse now. I have about 4 or 5 in my left eye and I only have 1 in my right eye the last time I visited the ophthalmologist but now, they are about 3 or 4 of them. I am so scared now. I don't want to go blind. This is so inconvenient. I am just only 33 years old.Please reply to my discussion if anyone knows about anything from herbal, to supplements, exercise or lifestyle habit or any medicine that helps cure, reduce or prevent floaters from getting worse......PLEASE HELP ME..."
Conjunctivitis,Virtual Realiity device and ARMS,"I have been receiving treatment for ARMD for more than 3 years. Monthly Avastin or Eyela injections have been fairly effective. Both eyes are ""wet"". My right eye is still good enough that I can read and drive with corrective lenses. My left eye is fairly useless. I have lost mid-vision and anything I look at with that eye is missing pieces and extremely distorted. I recently visited my brother and his grandson wanted me to try on his virtual reality goggles. When I did I was not surprised that I could not get the 3D effect but enjoyed watching the fish swim around me. The images were very clear. For some ereason I closed my good eye and was amazed when I realized I was seeing the same clear, intact, non distorted images. I made sure I was not using my good eye at all. We tried another app (dinosaurs) with the same result. I waited a few days and had the same result. I wondered if I could read using the goggles so my sister-in-law brought up a kindle e-book and I could read entire sentences - no blank spots, no distortion. My retinologist had no explanation.

Conjunctivitis,Vision problem - nondiagnosed,"Hi allWondering if someone could advise / recommend / help.So basically in October 2016, I had a black out, no real reason why, I'm fit and healthy otherwise and have since then seen a consultant at the hospital who has advised its to do with blood pressure, although I'm not happy with this at all.Since October, my vision has been different.I have also passed two eye tests and apart from a minor prescription one ophthalmologist found but recommended against, I passed and both times commented on my vision was really good.However, and since October (maybe before hand, but had not noticed them) but I have floaters in my eyes. But I can see these floaters, I recognise they are floaters, but there is also black spots over my vision, I can see through them but I can see them there as well as the floaters. In the mornings particularly my eyes do ache. I have also noticed that on looking at the sky/white screen, there are a lot of areas of my vision where it is almost like electrical currents, tiny ones, going across my vision. These symptoms are on top of seeing the floaters. I also find sometimes reading text that I almost have to re-adjust to read the text as I go across the words. And I have found that my eyes are more sensitive to light, especially sometimes where I've looked at bright light/the sun, I find that the after effect of still seeing the light in the vision is still there.As noted, the ophthalmologists have checked my eyes, retina and everything else they could have but no problems of note.I've been to the doctors several times and still nothing at all, more so waiting on the consultants at the hospital to finish their stage of discharging me once I have had a tilt test for my blood pressure, due in June.Has anyone experienced these symptoms / can advise / help in anyway??Mat"

Conjunctivitis,London Eye Hospital fails to deliver,"LEH still seems totally uninterested in investigating what goes wrong, when an AMD lens transplant doesn’t work, but leaves the patient with a deteriorated vision. Once you have paid for the procedure they have no further interest in you, nor are they interested finding out why the procedure had the opposite effect from what was expected and communicated to the patient. So, no answers from the LEH. My solicitor has requested my my medical records from the LEH, but unsurprisingly they hasn’t received the files. In fact, he has not even received a reply from LEH.I have with the help of my husbond written a complaint to the LEH about the poor treatment and lack of response from the LEH, and asked for my money back and a compensation for my deteriorated vision after the lens implant. Again, there has been no answer from the LEH.We really don’t know what more we can do to make the LEH to engage in the matter. Below you’ll find the content of the mail my husbond sent to the General Manger of the LEH, Mr. Lee Brearley:Dear Mr Lee Brearley,You may recall the unfortunate case of my wife, Astrid Bergmann. I shall not go into the finer details of this unhappy chain of events, but just briefly remind you, that my wife firstly, in September/October 2015, had your iolAMD lenses implanted in both eyes. Contrary to your expectations, and our hopes, she was left with a significantly deteriorated vision.Her vision was measured before the implant (with glasses in brackets) and the reading was 6/30 (6/15) on the right eye and 6/120 (6/19) on the left eye. After the implant, she was left with a vison of 6/60 (6/19) on the right eye and 6/6? (6/48) on the left eye.This was distinctly different from what was expected by Mr. M A Qureshi, who told us that in his experience and based on more than 500 similar operations, we could expect an improvement by at least 30 %, but likely more. On this basis we made the decision for Astrid to go through the procedure and paid GBP 22,000 to LEH.To remedy the poor result of the initial operations, LEH suggested to explant the iolAMD lenses, and instead implant the new EyeMax Mono lenses, as Ms Claire Wilson expected this would result in at least restoring Astrid’s vision to what it was before the first implant, and probably better.However, her vision after the second implant was by you measured to 6/120 (6/30) on the right eye, and 6/120 (6/48) on her left eye.We now understand that Astrid’s vision will not recover to the level it was before we got in touch with LEH. Astrid must now seek to recover as much quality of life as possible and we will seek financial compensation for her loss. We therefore demand the return of the payment for the operations GBP 22,000 and a compensation for her deteriorated vision of GBP 100,000."
Conjunctivitis,Dark area in vision NOT FLOATERS...,"Hello guys...i dont know how to describe this. for like 3 months ago i got floaters in my eye and they move with my eye movements just like a typical floater. For the next description i would love to refer to this thread and the topic creater has EXACTLY the same issue. https://patient.info/forums/discuss/dark-area-in-vision-not-floaters-538444In my right eye i dont know how long i have this but she describes this issue exactly and it really makes me anxious and im unable to do anything anymore Note that this issue is not floaters. i have this too but that other issue is bugging me and im really afraid that this might worse over time So to describe my problem for me. When i look with my right eye to my nose and hold my right eye to this position (it is like looking to directly on my nose) and after that i move my head to the right a dark area forms like a shadow kinda thing. it not entirely dark and resembles a greyish area circle thing. i have a feeling that this is transparent. The same thing happens when i look up with my right eye and hold my eye in this position and move my head downwards a dark area forms in my right side and it resembles a crescent moon. also greyish dark transparent. The more i move my head downwards/ to the right the more i influence those darkish areas. (they grow bigger smaller etc.) When my eyes are relaxed like looking straight i cant see them also i cant see them when my eyes are moving like like they normally do. They only appear when i do this weird movement with my head...Can anyone help me ? i was already at 3 eye doctos and they told me my eyes are fine. i also did a visual field test at 2 doctos and they told me all fine (eyes were dilated too). i wear a glass too and my right eye has myopia....and advice how to proceed ?

Conjunctivitis,Had problems with getting referred to Eye Clinic? ,"Hello everyone, hope your all ok? Last Wednesday the 12th of April 2017 I went to Specsavers for my yearly eye check up as I have cataracts in both eyes.Before I go on anymore Specsavers, meaning the Optometrist who checked my eyes was brilliant. She explained everything to me and what was going on.The Cataract in my right eye has changed considerably since last year and I am one away from having that Operated on. Meaning when I can't read the top line.The Optometrist says she has noticed something wrong with the back of my right eye, a swelling /bulge and something else which I have forgot. Anyway, she had her colleague come in for a second opinion and she looked at my eye and said the same thing. I had drops put in my right eye so the lady could see my eye better. I was given a letter marked URGENT to take straight to my doctors which I did the same day. The problem came when I rang my doctors surgery yesterday Wednesday the 19th April 2017. The woman who I spoke with kept saying we have received your Specsavers letter on the 12th, but the doctor is on holiday and won't be back until the 26th April. I said to this woman that I know you have the letter as I bought and handed it in myself. Then she went on about it having been the Easter weekend and when the doctor comes back she will refer me to the eye clinic. I said I am supposed to see the Ophthalmologist within two weeks, by the time the doctor comes back I would have to wait another two weeks. I Sent an email to Specsavers on there website and got a reply back very fast, they told me to Ring the Optometrist who I saw. I rang the Optometrist this morning and told her what happened and she said why didn't they hand it to another doctor ( it's a group practice) The woman at the doctors said they wouldn't do that as it's for one doctor named,the Optometrist rang me back today and said she has now faxed a referral to Moorfields eye Hospital so that I will be seen within the time frame she wanted. I have to have further investigation of Maculapathy in Right eye it says on letter I have. Has anyone else had this happen to them?

Conjunctivitis,Do people experience extremely dried eyes and swollen nose when going to certain libraries?,"I'm fairly young person with dried eyes and I enjoy reading books at libraries.Problem is, there are libraries that ruins my concentration by worsening my eye dryness and nose breathing. There are libraries that I can read books at for even longer than 10 hours, but some libraries cause the condition I described after 5~10 minutes of being there.I'm not quite familiar with science and I was wondering why this is the case? Is this something to do with poor designing of the building or conditioning the temperature and humidity?I'm fairly young person with dried eyes and I enjoy reading books at libraries.Problem is, there are libraries that ruins my concentration by worsening my eye dryness and nose breathing.

Conjunctivitis,Raised pressure in eye after eye drops,My wife had an eye test at the optician yesterday. They photographed the eye and checked the pressure before putting drops in. The drops going into the left eye stung more than in the right. After her tests with no change in her sight from last year they checked the pressure again and said that the pressure in the left one was still high and asked her to wait for fifteen minutes and have it checked again. If it didn't they said that she would need to go to the eye clinic at the hospital.It was still high and they asked her to wait another fifteen minutes. By then it had come down to their satisfaction but they said that if she had any eye pain later or today to go to the eye clinic.Is this a common happening after eye drops? She says that there is no pain but her eyes 'feel tired'
Conjunctivitis,Intractable Double Vision,"Good morningI have previously put a few posts on here about double vision etc. Did anyone know that Intractable Double Vision is so uncommon that all I can be told is I am very unique. I had squint surgery last year and it didn't go to plan so ended up having three surgerys but the double vision never went away. Now eight months after my last surgery they have told me it is unlikely to change and it will probably be perminant so I will never have the use of both of my eyes again as the link between my brain and eyes has stopped working and my brian no longer fuses images. I either have to wear an eye patch or occlusion lens to stop the double vision. It sucks, a year of trying really hard, numerous hospital appointments, operations etc. but no joy. Anyone else have this or no one of someone that has this? Really trying to find out how the fusion stopped working and why. I have seen two top consultants who can't tell me as they just don't know.

Conjunctivitis,Blepharitis and Dry Eye,"I have been prescribed Lacri-lube ointment that I have to put into the affected eye at night. It is very difficult to administer as it comes out like a piece of elastic and goes everywhere but into the eye. Does anyone have any experience of this ointment and tips on how to get it in there without so much wastage and more success? Help!Do't have anyone to help me, and most people would be very reluctant and afraid to come anywhere near someone else's eyes, anyway!"

Conjunctivitis,I cannot get rid of this eyelash from my eye? [Picture included],"Does this look like an eyelash to you? I had a surgery twenty years ago so maybe it's a thread? Or is it an eyelash?I cannot remove it using fingers, nor q-tip, nor water, and sleep doesn't naturally get rid of it. It's been days since I've noticed this. It seems to be stuck or inside the lacrimal fold of the eye. Do you think so too?"
Conjunctivitis,Seeing left and right sides reversed!,"Hi.My mum developed a rather unusual issue and no one can tell us what it can be. From time to time her vision...switches. Whats on her left, she see it on the right, and whats on her left she see it on the right.After a while it comes back to normal, but you can imagine how dangerous and scary this can be. Does anyone have any idea what this could be caused by? She went for 2 brain scans to rule out any tumors. The only other health problem she has is high blood pressure...She does not take any antidepressants (so she tells me). Does anyone have any idea or inclination what this might be? "
Conjunctivitis,Eye test at hospital in the morning. ,"Hi there, I had a regular eye test at Vision Express recently. Then I had them look into my eyes after they had put the drops in to dilate them. The girl doing the test said my eyes were healthy and I had no detached retinas. But there was a small area in each eye that she said she couldn't see with her equipment so she was sending me to the hospital as they would be able to see these small areas easier with their equipment. Anyone had this happen? I'm hoping the drops they use at the hospital will be the same as they use at the opticians as they don't make my eyes too blurry. Also, the appointment letter I got suggests I could be there for 2 hours. This implies they will be going through all the tests again. But the girl who sent me to the hospital was only concerned about the test with the eye drops. On pins now. Don't know what to expect!!Hi there, I had a regular eye test at Vision Express recently.

Conjunctivitis,what's the most probable eye problem I am having,"Yes I know I will have to see a specialist later but I want to have some psychological preparation first.I have been wearing glasses since I was 3, and now 33. I was the only child in the kindergarten who needed to wear glasses. However, both my parents don't need to wear glasses or contact lens.both my eyes are having similar degree of astigmatism but the right eyes are having more short-sightedThe difference in eye vision between left eye and right eye is very obvious. I could see, at least quite something with my left eye, I could'nt see a lot with my right eye. It's so worrying.The biggest problem is - the right eye usually feel a little bit more dry and uncomfortable, sometimes painful, while it does not happen to left eye. and the ""color"" of the vision of the right eye is less sharp as that of the left eye. In the night, it's more obvious because of lack of light. It looks like the right eye needs to see with more light under the same environmentWhat is the most probable eye problem I am having and if it can be managed or cured?Thanks a lot for all advice. "

Conjunctivitis,AMD/ Glaucoma,"I was diagnosed early dry AMD/early Glaucoma at the end of 2015. Since then i am using various eye drops for Glaucoma and some vitamins for early dry AMD.Now I have a question about the adverse effects of elecric bulbs. Here in Pakistan, Energy Savers bulbs were introduced quite some time back in place of old electric bulbs which were being used since long. Now Energy Saver bulbs are also becoming an item of the past as LED bulbs have come in since possibly more than a year back. These changes might have taken place in Europe/ USA etc as wel. What I want to know is whether these new inventions (electric bulbs) are safe for the eyes especialy when the old people like me are already having eye ailments? Any views on it."

I also have tired dry eyes and the day I woke up with it had a bit of dizzyness which is gone now. "
Conjunctivitis,What's wrong with my eyes??,I went to the opthemologist because one of my eyelids were swollen and and they both had itchy patches. He had me do warm compresses and apply cortisone.

Conjunctivitis,Pimple below my left eye,I have a pimple below my left eye most probably because of bug bite.It has been allmost 4 months and it is not going.Please help .Attached is screenshot. 
Conjunctivitis,Blind spot,"For the past month, I’ve had a weird blind spot in my right eye. It’s not big, and about twice as tall as wide. It flashes, the way lights flash if you look at them and close your eyes, but it never goes away. I guess you could described it as a sort of haze; when I close my left eye and point my right eye just right, I can block things that I should be able to see, no matter how bright (I haven’t tried with the sun or lasers, because I’m not an idiot, but I’ve tried with lamps, bright lights, etc). It flashes when I close my eyes, and if I squeeze them shut, it’ll flash again. It’s most visible when I’m trying to use the computer, or when it’s especially bright outside.I’m 26 and I have type 2 diabetes. Up until the past year, I’ve always had perfect blood sugar levels (A1C usually about 5.1). My blood sugar slipped for a while over the past year, but I finally got to see my doctor, and he prescribed a new medication to help with it. Since then, it’s been pretty consistently around 130, give or take.I saw my retinologist a few days after it first appeared (about a month ago now), and I told him about it. He dilated my eyes and did the usual exam. He said there was a single, minor hemorrhage in my left eye (the one *without* the spot), but that my right eye was fine. He swore up and down there was no retinopathy, and I trust him; I’ve known him a while, and he’s competent.I can’t get in to see any other eye-type doctor at all for at least a month, and that’s if I’m lucky. Even then, it’s just my optician, not an opthalmologist or something. Given that it’s not retinopathy, I have no idea what it is, or what can be done about it.When I close my eyes, another three tiny spots flash in a triangle around the original, close but not connected. These are much less noticeable, and I can’t make stuff disappear behind them (in fact, I usually can’t see them at all; it’s only for a brief moment when I close my eyes.What could this be? What can I do to fix it?"

Conjunctivitis,Rainbow Halos around light sources.. UPDATE!!! ,For about 3 weeks now I have been experiencing rainbow halos around light sources (typically worse at night) I have been to 2 opticians and had my eyes tested (needed my first prescription pair of glasses as I am short sighted and have an astigmatism) However no one can understand why I am experiencing rainbow halos around lights? On Saturday I went to an eye clinic at the Hospital. I explained my symptoms (rainbow halos around light sources etc.). They dilated my pupils so they could see the back on my eye clearly. Yet again the Ophthalmologist couldn’t find anything wrong. Everyone is scratching their heads so confused as to why I am experiencing these symptoms. So they are going to book me in with a consultant in 4-6 weeks’ time for his opinion. I was wondering if anyone has had this symptom before and if you found out what the cause of this is? 
Conjunctivitis,one inflammed and bloodshot eye,"hi there my names Andy and im new to this site and i just wanted to share my problem to see if anyone had any ideasall started in about febuary i started noticing my right eye would get slighty bloodshot, it would start normally in the night time but somtimes in the day and normally would clear up on its own, anyway it ketp returning so i made a trip to morefields in london and they said i had conjunctivitis, thats fine and precribed me some anitbiotic and steroid drops and i carreid on, i thought they was working but then my one bloodshot eye kept returning so i was thinking these are not working, so i went back and they give me different ones to see if they would work, perservative free this time incase i was allergic to perservatives, any way started using them again, thought they was working until i noticed my right eye was still getting bloodshot.. so now im 10 months down the line and i still have this problem except now i have full blown episodes of full bloodshot right eye and inflamed eye starting from the middle all the way around the eye until the other side, the bloodshot is now 10 times as bad, ive seen 10 different ophthalmic doctors now in morefields every different eyedrop known to man and had most of them diagosted me with something different every time, conjunctivitis, dry eye, blepaharitis, exema.. there where all wrong so i went private and the doctor said i have got oils in my eyes so diagenosed me with blepaharits.. and right my eyes might have signs of blepahartis but its no way the cause of one imflammed and bloodshot eye, for the simple face that it does not excist in one eye symtoms only, and blephartis is on the line of the eyelids where the hairs grow not inside the eye.. since then it has cost me over £2000 in seeing him for lots of bloodtest, cymidia, herpies, thyroid eye desese, swabs, also had a ct scan.. they all come back fine..he keeps saying its the blephartis but im 100% sure its not, no systoms of blep at all,just the bloodshot and imflammed eye and it never clears up now.. also if i drink alcohol which i dont do much omg does it bring it on, i know we all get a bit bloodshot eyes when we drink but not one fully bloodshot swelled eye and one normalhas anyone got any ideas of my problem, i really dont think its eye related as ive had so many different eye exams.. my vision is completely fine tooThanks"
Conjunctivitis,Macular Hole,"I had a vitrectomy seven weeks ago in the US.

My concern is that I can't yet read with the eye, that there is distortion up-close. Has anyone experienced a similar result?

Conjunctivitis,Pain in eyeballs/eye sockets,"Hello everyone!I wanted to ask about my eye problems. I have this eyeball pains, that occurs approx. 1-2times per 2 months. The pain happens on both eyes, but I think more likely in my left eye. The pain itself is pulsating, feels like maybe blood vain may be jammed. The exact location of pain is kind of hard to describe, wheater if its left or right eye, it always happens on the upper side of eye ball inside. It may be eye ball or eye socket pain. This problem occurs often enough to cause me discomfort, but not often enough to find the some kind of action pattern per day, to know what might be causing me this thing. If I stare at comuter screen, when this happens, pain intensifies enough, that It causes me to throw up. The epicenter of pain might be close to digestion point in my brain, so paint reaches it and causes me to vomit.I went to eye doctor in clinics, they did all kind of blood vessels tests, and they found nothing unususal. They sent me to neurologist, so yesterday i did roentgen test of my head, and now I am waiting for results.My both eyes are 0.75.In university, i have learned, that eye socket pain, along side with other zones in head may be caused by ultrasound noise. Ultrasound is pretty much everywhere..SO, does anyone might know what Im talking about, anyone experienced same thing? Any suggestions?"

Conjunctivitis,Myopic macular degeneration + retinal hemorrhages ,"hello, i am a 23 year old male and i have been told that I have myopic macular degeneration and have had retinal hemprrhages multiple times and I still suffer from vision loss from them even though the doctors told me that the hemorrhages are no longer there. I mainly suffer from what is like brown or blue droplets the cover my central vision and prevent me from seeing through it, however all the doctors that i have seen told me that they DO NOT know why I have this vision loss and therefore they did not give me a treatment for this. What makes things even worse, I was told that the retinal hemorrhages ""go away on their own"" and indeed my doctor told me that the hemorrhages have been reabsorbed in one eye but I STILL see in my central vision the grey spot where the blood was and my vision still did not return to norma, so do retinal hemorrhages leave behind permanent damage? This has been a huge burden for me and caused me extreme stress since i still do know know why I have this vision loss and I am in a very despirate position. i'm hoping that someone here can help me.Forbackground I can really only see from one eye (the left had retinal hemorrhages 3 years ago in the central vision and the doctors told me the blood disappeared after a few months but I still can not see at all from that eye leaving me blind)The right eye is the eye that I see with and I have done 3 surgeries on it about 4 years ago (retinal detatchment, surgery to remove blood from the eye after detatchment, and finally cataract surgery) the right eye also has hemorrhages but it has not yet reached my central visionIf anyone can help me out and tell me why i am going through this hell or even through out some possibilities ouit there I would really appreciate it. Thank you."
Conjunctivitis,visual snow and tinnitus ,"I've been seeing really really tiny dots (?) not really sure how to explain it but its like there are millions of them everywhere and you cant really identify just one dot. It's white when i see black or when it's dark and it's a dark colour when i see white (like white walls, or other light coloured objects). I've done some searching and I think I do have visual snow, and it's really depressing for me because I've already experienced the horrors of tinnitus and now I'll have to go through visual snow too? I'm a very cautious person and I tend to worry too much when it comes to anything really and having these kind of health problems is really taking its toll on me. I never feel like eating and all i really want to do is curl up in bed and cry. What if one day I end up blind and deaf? There are no treatments or cures for these conditons and little knowledge on what even caused it in the first place. I'm only 13 years old and I feel like my whole life is going to be such a drag because I can't even read things properly without getting so mad at myself for not being able to concentrate on the words (my vision makes it hard for me to do so). I have tried searching things up about visual snow but I've only found that I only get more scared as I read these things. No known cause, no treatment, NO CURE, nothing. I feel like nothing has a solid answer (its always maybe its that, maybe its not) and I'm just going to end up killing myself in the near future because even though i can't notice the ringing or the millions of dots most of the time during the day, i can still hear it everytime I lay down in bed and that really scares me. I'm always okay and then not okay. I don't know if I'll ever ""get used"" to these things or if I'll ever be mentally stable because it doesn't seem that way right now. However, I am quite lucky for my condition to not be as serious as many other sufferers and I am very, very thankful for that. But I don't know if being grateful is ever going to be enough. Can anyone please help me or give me some advice?I really don't want to die because I love my family and my friends but I feel like one day I will kill myself because somedays I just get so tired of the constant non-stop ringing in my ears and the dots that i see everywhere, all the time (even when I close my eyes). It's just really scary and I really would appreciate some advice or news on researchers working on finding the treatment or atleast some interest in trying to understand these conditions.Thank you to those who took the time to read this and please do answer if you have absolutely anything you know about visual snow or tinnitus.

Conjunctivitis,Is there anyway to fix my eyesight?,"Hello! So i have a question. Is there any way I can be able to fix my eye sight? My both eyes are 0.75. I went to eye doctor, and she said, that there are some of the excercises to children and teens, under age 16. I am 23 now. She said that there is pretty much no solution, except contact lenses or glasses.My father spoke of his friend, that used book/video lessons, that excrecises eye muscles. This book was written by russian author, named Norbekov or something like that. He states, that low eyesight is only eye muscle ""lazyness"" if you will. That friend of his, used this lessons and in time, he managed to play tennis without eyeglasses, when he used to play all the time wearing it.So that puts me in a very confusing position, which I dont know what to believe: eyedoctor or internet. Eye doctor states there is nothing I can do, and the internet states that there is something I can do.DO you have any suggestions, or excercises, that have proven itself worthy to you guys? Maybe some food supplement? I heard that carrots are good for my eyes."
Conjunctivitis,Intense pain and other symptoms in left eye,"For the past few weeks I've been getting headaches near my left temple that would last for hours. I get eye strain headaches a lot and this one is different. I thought maybe I needed to rest my eyes since I'm a college student, so I took all of spring break weak to rest them. Coming back, the headaches still happen and are much worse. It's pretty much constantly there, just goes from numb to extreme pain sometimes, I was crying and couldn't sleep the other night. It's in the same spot- left temple area with one small area that hurts the worst like something is piercing. The vein or artery (I don't know which is which, but it's not the blue visible one) near this area also becomes very prominent and bulges when the headaches get bad. In addition, over the past few days I have noticed a small black dot near the center of my vision in my left eye. It moves when I move my eye. There might be other even smaller dots nearby but I can't quite tell. I thought this all might be migraines at first, but it is very specific and isn't going fully away. Things to note:-I've had muscle surgery separately on each eye, with my left eye being the most recent (2013).-my grandma has glaucoma, not sure if it's related but I know thats hereditary "
Conjunctivitis,my annoying chalazion,"During the summer ie july i had to work 54 hour weeks and i didnt get sufficient sleep. then i went on a camping trip and a couple of days later my eye swelled up and i thought that i had got an infection from camping. the eyelid (upper) was sooo red and my mu suggested that i put a hot compress on it-i did at tht stage, but the next few months ive noticed that my vision in tht eye has impaired. i see double when i read font with tht eye ad things are blurred. its soo annoying cos i dnt wear glasses -my eyes are perfect and i asked my pharmacist about it and they werer noo help. Then after bout 2 months and a growing lump on my upper eye lid, i went to the optomtrist and they just checked my vision, so then i went bk a month later an told them bout the lump and they said 'aww jus put a hot compress on it , it shud come out soon after that' and ive been doing tht every so often but i still have this lump 5 months later-its soo unfair and i never met anyone with this problem and i stil havent got rid of it. So im hinkin ill go to my doctor and get him to refer me to an eye specialist o havit removed or get sumtin to sort it cos its doin my head in and everytime i have eyeshadow on i hav to put like loads more layers on top of the stupid chalazion so it doesnt show up like the big fat lump tht it is! grrrrr wot do u guys think?"

Conjunctivitis,Abnormal eye exam. Help,"Hi,I am 29 and had a dodgy eye test back in Jan and had to wait for a hospital referral. I have got 2 appts in space of 2 weeks coming up at the hospital with the specialists. On the retinal photo it came up with a swollen optic nerve, and something else (can't remember what) this was on Jan and I've kinda put it to back of my mind but my eyes been sore past 2 days so just had a Google, and aparently a swollen optic nerve can be the sign of a tumour. This has freaked me out majorly now... I was already aware of this but told worse case and highly unlikely. But everything I google is swollen optic nerve = brain tumour/glaucoma now my eye pressures were fine so doubted that. Putting it together with my memory problems (things that happened yesterday on even earlier in the day feel like they happened years ago) and lack concentration and i am off on a big panic ??? "

Conjunctivitis,Bad vision in one eye,I'm currently 24 years old and have been having trouble with one of my eyes for as long as I can remember. I haven't worried about it much until recently after I noticed it has gotten worse over the past few years. There's a blind spot almost directly in the center of my vision and it seems to be growing slowly. Sometimes colors are faded and darker in that eye compared to my good one. Straight lines have a squiggle right in the middle of them. I noticed that after I did some research and found out about AMD. It says it's age related but it seems to describe my situation perfectly. I went to the eye doctor a few years back and they told me it was a birth defect and they'd contact me if they could do anything to help it but I haven't heard from them since. I'm currently scheduled to go to a different eye doctor and I have no idea what to expect. It's really scary for me because I have a huge fear of going blind. That's why I came here to maybe get some answers as to what's going on with my eye.

Conjunctivitis,Do i have a typical black eye or is it something more serious,"I got punched 7 days ago, the day after, it was slightly swollen, i had purple bruising under the eye, a small amount in the outside corner of my eye socket also the white of my eye was approx a quarter blood.Fastforward a week, there is no swelling, much of the bruising has gone/faded to yellow apart from a thick purple mark under the eye, however it does not hurt when pressed (unlike a bruise), and there is still a lot of blood in my eye.. no change within a week.. the only place where there is pain is on the top of my cheekbone or on the far outside of my eye socket, this is painful when pressed.Is this just a bad black eye that needs extra recovery time or could it be something more serious?

Conjunctivitis,Occlusion Lens,Hi everyone. Just wondered if anyone has used or uses an occlusion lens and how good they are? I have been told i have intractable diplopia so the only way to get single vision is block the vision from one eye.

Conjunctivitis,Computer Vision Syndrome - Please Help!,"I was diagnosed with Computer Vision Syndrome by a doctor 2 years ago. He prescribed me Computer Vision glasses with Anti Glare coating to help with my sore, red & watery eyes. I started wearing those glasses regularly for the next 2 years.This has helped me tremendously. My glasses have scratches so I bought a new pair of glasses yesterday.The new glasses have Plastic lens with Anti Glare Coating (the greenish reflection), the old glasses had Glass lens (with purple reflection). Anyways when I see through my new glasses, there is a slight Redish/Purplish hue. Whereas when I look through my old glasses, they have a Yellowish/Orangish hue. I think the new glasses make everything pop a little as if they have increased the contrast or something.My question is, is Purplish/Redish hue when looking through the glasses is fine or does it have any sort of bad implications on eye health?I work with Computers all day long. I look at computer screen at least 18 hours a day. "

Conjunctivitis,Permanent flashes and both eyes and a tiny blind spot,"PLEASE HELP meHere is my problem. I had a car accident back in July where I was hit on the drivers door by a car eating a red light. During the impact I hit my head hard on the steering wheel and fractured my orbital bone over my left eye. When in the emergency room they did a cat scan finding the fracture and referred me to an ophthalmologist. I explain to the ophthalmologist the black spots that were now in both eyes. He referred me to a retina specialist. Right away the retina specialist found three Horshoe tears two in the left eye and one in the right! Hey repair the two tears on the left eye and one week later repair the one on the right eye . Only after the surgeries I got stuck with flashes in both eyes. I've had numerous appointment with the retina specialist where he keeps saying everything looks fine and the flashes should go away it's now been seven months and I still have the flashes . The flashes look like car lights coming at you at night time and like drops of water hittin a body of water, lights are way brighter and every light has lines going in all directions. He then send me to a Neuro- ophthalmologist claiming it was related to the brain since I was also diagnosed with a concussionThe Neuro-ophthalmologist said there's no way it's connected to the brain that after retina surgery is a small percentage of people end up with the flashers. He then said I was in the category of those people who end up with flashes after retina surgery. I have an appointment with the retina specialist in a month and I'm waiting to see what he's going to suggest now. Can anyone help me with any information thank you"

Conjunctivitis,Vision Problem for almost 2 years.,"I have had my vision problem for over 2 years. It came out of nowhere.It is hard to explain, although I will try.Firstly, it seems as though my central field of view has been reduced and the outer edges replaced with more peripheral vision. This makes reading difficult. When reading signs, number plates etc. I am unable to see the whole word and have to scan across before I am able to read it.I have difficulty looking at things close up or that are small. It seems as though my eyes won't stay in a single position when looking at them. I have to try really hard to look at them.My vision problem makes me very drowsy and gives me headaches and constant head pressure. I have to pop my ears constantly. It also makes concentrating difficult and reading very tiring.I have been to opticians many times, with no indication of anything wrong. I must stress that my vision is not out of focus and it is not tunnel vision.Thank you for your time,James"

Conjunctivitis,Floaters and eye examinatoon,Without any previous symptoms I developed frightening floaters in my left eye which I immediately went to my optician to check out.He examined both eyes thoroughly and explained why these occur..but also said that he detected a slight bleed but was unable to look in more detail so referred me to see the Hospital Eye Consultant. During the procedure he put drops in my affected eye to dial ate the pupil. This was very sore and today I still feel my eye is sore and has a slight ache.The blackness of the floaters seem less obvious today but still are moving with my eye when I focus. I am very frightened and want to ask anyone if they have experienced similar problems.

Conjunctivitis,Headache Back of Head (left side),"I have had this really annoying ache at the back of my head on the left, which seems to be triggered by using computers or anything like mobile phone screens, etc. I am using computers for massively long hours (setting up a web design business). I have noticed it get worse, as it only takes about 40 minutes of being on the computer and it starts. I seem to be fine when not on computers. I am 19 years of age. I'm no medical professional but the only thing I think of, is it could be something to do with eyesight? From memory, I used to make a yearly trip to the opticians who always told me I was on the borderline for needing glasses part-time? Then I think it was the last time I went when I was 14, and they did prescribe me with glasses that year for part-time use. Being a typical 14-year-old, a never wore them. Would you think that's a possible cause? "

Conjunctivitis,retinal detachments and flying,"I have thin fragile retinas, and an uncle and mother who have had retinal detachments. I am now 60 and in good health, but travel between UK and Spain. I had my first (of 5) detachment, in the right eye, some 15 years ago (successful laser treatment) , followed by one in left eye (successful laser and cryo treatment) 12 years ago, then another in the right (successful laser treatment, but needed glasses to correct squint) some 6 years ago. Then right eye went again some 4 years ago; laser treatment didn't work, but I then had a successful vitrectomy. This was followed by cataract surgery in both eyes - wonderfully successful. During these years I flew 2 or 3 return trips per year, mostly short but some long haul. In April, some 6 weeks ago, I flew a 2 hour flight, and two days later I saw a detachment in the right eye. I had another - successful - vitrectomy. After two and a half weeks the gas had gone, and I was given the OK to fly back to Spain, which I did a week later. Another 2 hour flight - and three days later the right retina detached again, same eye, different location. It was a tiny hole, but lasering didn't do the trick, so I am now holding my head in the right position as vitrectomy number three does its job. Both the last two surgeons have assured me that there is no statistical correlation between flying and detachments, but right now I don't want to get on another plane ever - which is going to make for a lot of problems. Are you aware of any relationship between flying and retinal detachments? I don't know if the pressure changes might have an effect? Or anyone researching detachments who might have suggestions? I'd be very grateful for any ideas or advice. To date I have been treated with incredible success, but I don't know how many more times the retina can be stuck back down..."
Conjunctivitis,Chronic eye bleeding,"My friend has had three eye surgeries since January 13. He had gone in to have an artificial lens in his right eye, which he had not had vision in since an accident a number of years ago. Folllowing each surgery, the eye filled with blood and he would get horrible headaches in the eye/temple area and would experinece continuous vomiting and nausea.The last operation (to drain the blood) was Feb 1. He seemed to be recovering but today he said the pain is back. He has also had no sign of any vision at all since the original surgery January 13. It could be that the bleeding commences before the vision every time.The surgeon says this is very rare and puts it down to bad luck. But when does this end? He's about given up on this eye and wants to ust fix the slipped artifical lens on his other eye so he had have some sort of vision and life again.Anyone know what's happening here and what can/should be done?"
Conjunctivitis,Blood dripping from eye,"Hi, I woke the other night with a lot of moisture pooling on my eye and dripping down my cheek. When I woke I had dried blood on my face. About 20min after I woke, my eye had a little bright red blood coming out along my lower lid. I took out my contacts (I wear extended wear, sometime a little longer than I should) and it stopped. The following night I bleed a small amount 2 times.I have no known health problems, no diabetes, good BP. My eye looks fine. It's not red or inflamed or sore or anything!I went to the eye doctor today and my eye looked healthy, my lids look fine. He did not know what would cause this and seemed a little skeptical it actually bled. About an hour later a small amount of blood came out again. My eye feels slightly dry but that's about it. Any idea what it could be? I really can't find anything describing this online.Thanks!"
Conjunctivitis,Eyes shaking wobbling,"When looking at objects, it gets worse with the distance, my vision is unstable like I cannot fix it on a point? Like a home video camera bobbing about. My depth perception also seems off, reduced.I also have hazy (visual snow) and colours seem darker/dimmer than they used to. I also have tinnitus.I was taking BENZOS/antidepressants about 4 months ago, but this problem still exists. It could also have been potentially due to CO poisoning.I had an MRI and it said asymmetric optic nerve sheath, although the doctor confirms this is fine.What coykd be causing this? Is there any hope it will go away? Please help"

Conjunctivitis,Unable to see after orbital decompression,"I suffer with Thyroid Eye Disease (TED). I had an orbital decompression carried out on my left eye 9 days ago. Since the morning after the operation I have been unable to see.I have had an MRI & a CT scan which both came back saying my optical nerve was healthy & there's no sign of a hematoma which would cause oxygen loss meaning loss of vision.The doctors suspected I may have had an eye stroke as this was the last thing to rule out. They arranged for me to have Fluorescein Angiogram carried out yesterday to look at my vessels to try & diagnose if I had indeed suffered an eye stroke. The test came back that my eye was clear of any problems. I was told if the photos taken from the back of my eye were shown to a specialist who didn't know my case he would say my eye is perfectly healthy - yet I'm still unable to see anything out of my eye.The doctors are completely baffled by my situation, they have never seen anything like it before & my file is being sent to the mentor of my surgeon who is based at Morefields is London. I have no timescale as to when I will get a reply & I'm obviously worried that I won't see out of my eye again.Has anyone come across anything like this before? "
Conjunctivitis,Semen in my eye,I about 2 weeks ago I got semen in my eye while having what I considered safe sex with someone I don't know very well.

Conjunctivitis,Sudden blurred vision and pain in my left eye ,Hello there I thought I would do a new post on this eye situation as it still worrys me and hopefully we will get to the bottom of this strange eye problem.First thing so I have had no problems at all with my sight/vision before this all started. It was 17/01/17and had slight pain in and behide my left eye and just hoped it would just go away like a headache does. On 20/01/17 I still had the pain a thought it was best to go and see my GP/Dr to see whats going on. My Doctor looked in my eye and could not see anything there but said to book myself an apointment at my local opticians as they have better equipment to see more closly. on 26/01/17 I was at work and started to notice my vision in my left eye was very dull/washed out so got worred and went straight to A&E. Told them that I had a problem in my left eye and had to do the silly eye test letter thing and I read it back to front and confused the the nurse and she said ok clever clogs can you read it stating from the front as it was reflected from a mirror behind me lol. Anyways past that test very good but was having trouble reading the lower/tiny leters at with my left eye. So I was in the waiting room at the A&E waiting for the Dr to see me. The Dr looked in both my eyes and then looked back in my left eye and said my eye inside looks like an old persons eye? which then thought he nay have found somthing. So the Dr said that I need to see an optician Today asap so he got me an apointment an hour later at the eye clinic in the hospital. I arrived at the eye clinic and had to do the eye test againg and told them that I have pain in my eye and my visions a little cloudy/dull. The eye specialist looked in my eyes and done test and put some dye in my eyes to look at the back but No luck. He said that he could not fined anything?. Strange that the other Dr said my left eye looked like it was from an old person. So apon that visit to the A&E there was nothing they could find wrong with my eye but had to come back after 6 weeks to see If there is any change so went back home. I Thought It would be good to get a second opinion and book myself at my local opticians and pay for a full test si did. 30/02/17 I went to the opticians to see if they could see anything wrong but no nothing. The optician could not find anything wrong apart from that my left eye has a slight prescription and said that my sight may jave been like that for a long time and because of the pain I noticed the slight vision loss in that eye and was not that bad to bother with it and told me not to look things up on the internet as it will make you worry more. Yes the optician was right about that looking things up but not right about my vision as I have never had cloudy/dull eyes before so now I have to wait around 4 weeks and go back to the opticians. 02/02/17 my eye is realy bad today and noticed last night that I could almost see in the dark lol and I am not the first to put that on this website yes night vision but only my left eye very odd ha ha but yes its true. So now im in a bit of a place now that even the specialist cant find anything and to be told to just give it a 4 weeks or so and come back is no good. I feel like do I go back sooner or wait it out? What do I do now as the optician said that basically I should have listened to the eye optician at the hospital and not have booked second opinion I feel im wasting peoples time but Im just looking after number one myself. I will follow this on the outcome but maybe blined by then though lol Hello there I thought I would do a new post on this eye situation as it still worrys me and hopefully we will get to the bottom of this strange eye problem.First thing so I have had no problems at all with my sight/vision before this all started.

Conjunctivitis,2 year old daughter to wear glasses? ,"Hi, I wonder if any one could help me- y daughter is 2 and a half and since about 15 months she developed a slight squint or lazy eye when she became tired (only for a few seconds) then she would rub her eyes and her eyes would usually straighten back up.Recently when she is I her iPad holding it close up she started blinking in one eye snd crying asking for a tissue (as if something is either in it or is blury and bothering her)Anyway, we went back to the options and this time they said her vision is good slightly long sighted but normal for her age. They wrote her a prescription for +1 glasses based on her symptoms (lazy eye when tired) and complaing of needing a tissue to wipe eye) When I asked the optition what will the glasses help with, she said it was to take the strain off the weaker eye so she can see better, I said ok but I was a bit concerned as I always thought that with a lazy eye you are supposed to patch the good eye to make the lazy eye work harder.??Now I'm freaking out because I went home and googled lazy eye / squints and all the prognosis is to wear a patch in good eye and NOT the opposite which is what the optition suggests we do.I'm really confused... can anyone please advise??Thanks in advance "
Conjunctivitis,Natural way of improving eyesight ? Does it exist ?,"Hey ! I am short-sighted and my vision is not extremely bad, but bad enough that I wear contact lenses (-0.75) sometimes to see from far distances. I think my real vision is something like -1.00I am asking if there is any REAL natural way I can improve my eyesight. I heard a lot about eye exercises (also yoga, meditation etc.) and a lot of stories how it helped people but on other hand every eye doctor says that this is not possible to do since it just strengthens eye muscles and not fix the real problem which is the shape of your eye that is causing the problem. I can say that my eyesight fluctuates based on how much I look at the screens or read books. If I go in nature for some time, my eyesight will definitely improve a little. Wearing less contact lenses and looking far a lot will again, definitely improve my eyesight. Now I really don't understand what is the truth behind this. Specialists say that you cannot improve eyesight... My eyesight does fluctuate here and there and I am wondering if I could fix it somehow. Some of my relatives who were short-sighted as a teenagers, the vision improved as they grew older. Now their vision is perfect. If anybody has any experiences. Should I try any exercises ? Maybe diet ? I honestly don't know who to believe. I definitely don't want to lose time with something that definitely doesn't help. "

Conjunctivitis,Eye Vision Problem in Daylight,"Hi,My son is currently 2 years and 6 months old. He is having problem in his vision when he faces the sunlight. We also noticed that the eyes balls of my son are kept vibrating a bit since he was 6 months old.One thing we have noticed that he has nearly a normal vision in night time or in evening time. The problem starts when he goes out at day time in which he could not focus the things he want, instead he keeps his eyes in looking downward position. For example, in day light, if we call him to say bye bye, then he keeps his eyes downward as he is looking the ground and just wave the hand to us and says bye.I am very upset about his vision problem. I need advice to know what medical problem he is suffering from."
Conjunctivitis,Have you been diagnosed with Pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PEX)? ,"Seeking to start a discussion with other people who've had this diagnosis(PEX). It's an inherited condition caused by a powdering of cells in the eye which clogs ducts, builds up pressure in the eye and leads to a secondary glaucoma. It doesn't seem to be that rare (5% in some northern European countries) but there is no medication for it and apparently very little research. "
Conjunctivitis,What is this?! ,"So... I really don't know what's going on, and it's kinda hard to describe right now. I'd say about 5 days ago, I received a sudden change in the vision of my right eye after getting off of my computer; for some reason now, the vision in this eye appears as if I've looked through something extremely bright and now it just won't stabilize. It's like my left eye sees things clearly but my right eye is like, I'm looking at things through a light glare, and now it's also like I'm looking through one large illusion. The eye can see, but things are slightly blurry. If I get into area with light, the symptoms are only worse and then my eye may hurt at random times, be it a dull pain or sharp pain. The peripheral vision is somewhat wonky, I can see things in it but I can't see any details. Example: I can see my fridge but because it feels like everything is just one big glare to me, I can see a small amount of I guess pressure. Left eye can see it clearly. Only way it gets WORSE is if I look at a computer screen(with a light background). Right eye can only really focus on the one word that specifically look at, anything else, I can see that the words may be there but at the same time, I only see the light background and in some areas are blind spots, where I can't see anything by light. It's like my eye was damaged somewhere but I don't know where. I went to an eye doctor and they did a mild dilation, couldn't find anything, and blamed it on Dry Eye. Does this really sound like dry eye? "
Conjunctivitis,Clarifying eye diopters,"Hi to all,Two years ago, I went to ophthalmologist for eye exam.

She is now almost 8 years old and she loves reading.As far as I know, if reading many hours during the day, the myopea increases, as the eyes get focused to close object and this causes tension of the lens muscle which eventually causes the eye to lenghen.I want to buy a projector, so my daughter will read e-books on screen placed 3 meters from her, and so her eyes will not focus on close object and the myopia will not increase.Did anybody try this method?Will appretiate any advice.LeoG"

For about 4-5 months I have these flickering vision problems. It feels like a quick blink. I don't have any headaches. My eyes don't hurt either. About once or twice a day a I get these weird shiny spots in my vision. For about a 10 days now I have had a weird tingling sensation in my spine that runs down to my legs and sometimes arms. This tingling sensation doesn't last too much it comes and goes. I don't have any muscle twitching, weakness or pain. Also I should mention that I am an extremly anxious person. I freak out quite easily and I am a hypochondriac too. Even though I am aware about my hypochondria I don't think I am making up these symptoms. The tingling sensation in my extremities get's worse when I am worried or when I am having a panic attack. But I get them even when I am calm. I am too afraid to go to a doctor because my mind just freaks out and in those moments I am able to imagine that I have some uncurable, lethal disease. Maybe it's just how my body reacts to stress or maybe there is really something wrong with me. Thank you in advance. Sorry for my post being so long. Hi! Sorry in advance for my bad English.

Conjunctivitis,Problem with Sodium Cromoglicate eye drops.,I had my cataracts done over two years ago and have been happy with the results. For some months the vision on my right eye has been blurry. Ophthalmologist said it was caused by dryness and a film over the eye and gave me HYLO Tears that have not helped. My GP looked at my eye on Friday and gave me a prescription for Sodium Cromoglicate Eye Drops. The leaflet says if symptoms do not improve within two days you should consult your doctor. The side effects include 'blurring of vision' but it also says that blurring can occur immediately after using the drops but side effects should wear off after a short time.I did not notice any benefit from it after two day and since using it today the sight in that eye is quite a bit worse.Do I stop using it or give it a few more days ?I had my cataracts done over two years ago and have been happy with the results.

Conjunctivitis,Are there any blood pressure tablets that do not cause dry eyes.,i absolutely cannot cope with the Gritty...increasingly worsening sensation of dare I say dehydrated eyes from taking blood pressure medication. copious amounts of lubricating drops recommended by specialist opthlmolgists makes no difference whatsoever.the soreness is so painful...when I blink the lid feels like it's scrapping the sclera.i have reacted badly to amniodipine and now candesartan which are milder tablets.I was ok on 4 mg.....now increased to 8 ....unbearable.i understand that many of the beta blockers and diuretics have the side effect.is anyone on a medication that does not have this side effect.i appreciate that many people do not react...or have adverse reactions.certainly have I have an appointment with my doctor to change the medicine.i appreciate any opinions.thanks for reading this...wishing you all harmony in this new year!???
Conjunctivitis,Prism correction for horizontal diplopia at a distance,"I've had worsening diplopia for close to a decade--first at night (when I was tired), but now pretty much 24/7 (I'm almost 50). I was prescribed glasses with a good deal of prism (sorry, don't have the script handy), and these didn't work at all. However, the prism testing ""monocle"" the doctor used resolved the diplopia immediate and profoundly. I'm not sure how the testing ""monocle"" translates into a glasses prescription, so I'm not sure why the monocle would work, but the glasses wouldn't, other than the lab made the lenses wrong. Any thoughts? (I asked the doctor if I could buy his prism testing monocle, and just walk around with that for the rest of my life, since it worked so well!)."

Conjunctivitis,Detachment or retinoschisis ?,"Occasional shadow lower left eye.Non retinal specialist #1 declares a retinal detachment, sends me to spcialist.

He suggests laser treatment around it’s periphery.Two weeks later I’m pushed by a friend for a second opinion.Specialist #2 declares detachment and immediate need for surgery.He brings in other doc at practice who says the same thing. Surgery within days or I’m a fool says doc #3Non retinal specialist # 2 then next morning ( also after a bad night) ( also an ophthalmologist) supports docs 2 and 3, but is more vehement; says docs 2 and 3 are best and I’m nuts not to have surgery within days.Retinal specialist # 4 sees both retinoschisis and detachment, suggests demarcating with laser and treatment with gas bubble, as surgery is excessive.WHAT IS GOING ON?

Conjunctivitis,NARROW ANGLE EYE GLAUCOMA ATTACK.,"I had suffered a serious migraine, more severe than I had ever experienced a few years ago. Went to the ER The pain was so different than a usual migraine included pressure in my eye. The ER couldn't find any thing wrong and gave me Tylenol & cold compress for my eye and sent me home. The next day my eye had swollen almost shut and the migraine never subsided. I called my optimologist and was directed to come in immediately.As it turned out I had a attack of narrow angle closure glaucoma. The pressure behind the eye builds up and the fluid level circulates behind the eye with no way to escape.A narrow angle is a common condition related to the size and shape of the eye, and is a risk factor for developing and increased risk for developing eye pressure as we age.My treatment to lower the risk of acute angle closure glaucoma a small hole was placed in the iris with a laser & by placing a hole in the iris is an alternate pathway made for the fluid to reach the drainage area of the eye. This prevents complete closure of the angle and the resulting high eye pressure I experienced with migraine.I have my eyes checked every year. I had never heard of this before, or had never had another attack in the other eye.Has anyone experienced narrow angle glaucoma? How was you eye treated? ? "

Conjunctivitis,"Retinal tear, laser, feeling off balanced","Hello, 6 days ago I had sudden onset of a dark whisper appear in my field of vision.

Conjunctivitis,Pain between eyebrows,"Hello, i am at a bit of a loss here. Starting a couple of months ago, I've been experiencing pain between my eyebrows when i engage in an activity where i need to focus. I usually notice it the most when i'm at work (reading labels while moving) and when i'm in front of a computer. Also, looking up feels somewhat uncomfortable. I know this sounds like your typical eye strain, but i've taken countermeasures to combat it(using f.lux on my computer and renewing my glasses 6 months ago, fixing my room lighting and using eye drops). Sometimes the back of my head(scalp) also hurts and it's even tender sometimes(it hurts when i lay down on a pillow)To make things worse it feels like i'm not present when this kicks in. Like my brain goes into spiral and I end up doing something that i didn't mean to do in the first place (i.e going the opposite direction before catching myself and just the feeling of not being in full control). Also, when i feel the headache it's very difficult to focus(i feel like i'm ""slow"", leading to the events i mentioned above. My doctor thinks that it's tension headache and the cause of the tension is due to my IBS-C (he also diagnozed this). In short he wants me to take Elavil (an antidepressant) and I really don't want to rely on it. Also i would like to note that i have an eye coordination problem since i was a kid. I still have the problem today(one of my eyes tend to wander off a different direction) I do wear glasses since I can't see far away. I feel like this could be my problem, I am not sure anymore. I've ruled out a couple of things already, I could control my IBS with including fiber to my diet. Also, I don't think it's a decongestion issue and to make sure i've been using a humidifier in my room for a while now. The only thing I could think of that might be related is the fact that it might have to do with my neck. I say this because my neck do feel stiff(not enough to worry about it) at times and it used to ""lock in"" I changed my chair a couple of days ago and I am changing my sitting pattern to a healthier one. The only reason why i brought this up is because my work involves heavy lifting sometimes. Has anyone else experienced something similar before? Any type of advice would be greatly appreciated. I am only 21 years old and i'm healthy. I do go to the gym regularly and my work keeps me on my toes.Thank you for your time. "
Conjunctivitis,Conjunctivitis and eye pain when trying to sleep,"Hi folksI am currently on day 12 of quite a severe case of viral conjunctiviti as diagnosed by my doctor.So far I am getting on with it. One of the things that is really unpleasant and causing me a problem though is the gritty painful sensation in my eyes that becomes really noticeable whenever I close my eyes and gets gradually worse and worse until it is excrucitaing and forces my to open my eyes. This has been making sleep impossible for several days now.To try and help with this so far I have used liquid gel eye drops, anti viral eye drops, various compresses hot and cold, ice. I have tried sleeping in different positions eg my head higher / lower than my body. I have tried camomile tea both dribbled in the eyes or as a comress, steam face baths, hot baths before bed. Have tried gently rubbing with baby shampoo and warm water. Have tried sleeping at different times of day or night. Have even been given and taken sleeping tablets.So far none of these things is helping at all. It is the same burning gritty pain that grows in intensity that is keeping me awake every night.Could anyone suggest anything that may work that I have missed from this list? Any ideas would be appreciated.. "
Conjunctivitis,Severe Dry eyes in Teenager... please help,"Hello, I’m a 17 year old turning 18 in a few days, and I suffer extremely dry/irritated eyes that are ruining my life I know it sounds crazy that such a young person could be suffering from it but it’s true. This condition has completely changed my life. I constantly have a dry, gritty feeling, often accompanied by burning stinging and itching, as well as a foreign body sensation, sore and tired eyes. I have to avoid direct wind or fans/ac. It affects me almost constantly, every day. I've actually had this condition for almost a year and a half now, and although earlier in the year it seemed like it was getting worse, with the help of my eye doctor and taking my own measures, in recent months my symptoms have significantly improved. I take Restasis twice a day and allergy eye drops (pataday) once a day. I have to use over the counter eye drops like Refresh (preservative free and regular) many times a day. Towards the end of the day my symptoms get worse. I take omega 3 fish oil pills everyday but I'm not sure if they make a difference. My symptoms are so severe I barely finished my last semester of high school because the severe pain and discomfort I’m in makes it very difficult to do schoolwork. I also cannot have a job because of this. I am depressed and can barely do any of the things I used to be able to do. Although in the last few months my eyes seem to be improving more, I desperately want to know whats causing this condition, and is there anyone my age out there with this? I don’t have a lot of money because I obviously can’t work and my family is low income, so I can’t afford expensive alternative treatments… What can I do? Please help me, I am desperate."
Conjunctivitis,"Light sensitivity and blurring for months, any ideas? ","18, amle, the last 2 months or so I've been having weird eye problems. It started with developing a terrible health anxiety that still sometimes cripples me today, but not nearly as badly. Basically,Bright lights (street lamps, christmas lights sometimes, car lights, etc) are much brighter then they should be and give a sort of glare to me now. In the day time, it doesn't affect me at all, or basically when a light overpowers it. Even in my room small lights will give me a bright glare effect, but when I turn the ceiling light on, its back to normal. I also have a sort of blur/double vision thing going on. Now its never a real double image, more of a vertical half ghosting if that makes sense. Only happens on certain things too like small reflective materials (top of a soda can for example) or lights or even sometimes the icons on a PC, but only the icons. It's gotten a bit worse the last couple days but that could be my axiety. I'd like to also say, I do spend most of my free time staring at a computer screen and get much sleep then I should, but I still can't put a name to whatever is going on with my eyes. My family is kind of in a rough spot right now so I'm not so sure about seeing a specialist plus I die a little bit inside thinking about going to the doctors and getting bad news. Anyone have any idea? "

Conjunctivitis,Constant Eye Strain,"Hey Guys,?I have been getting eye strain on and off for the last two years, each time it is lasting longer.My general symptoms are:- terrible eyepain EVEN WHEN YOU SHUT YOUR EYES (E.G. AT NIGHT)?- soreness that doesn’t go away whether you are awake or asleep- onset through deep and widespread sense of diffused pain- almost throbbing – but constant – pain in the temple- chronic pain seemingly inside or behind the eyeballs- a dragging sensation of irritation and abrasiveness - heavy tired eyelids that feel totally exhausted when you squeeze/ blink- photosensitivity (eyes burn when looking at a computer screen or TV or even while driving) - sensation of being swollenI have been to three highstreet opticians: Specsavers, Boots and most recently Vision express who presscibed me prism lenses about a week ago, my eye test results are attached.?I have had the prism lenses for just under two weeks and have eye strain again. I am not sure whether I need to give them a little bit longer to get used to them.?I have just been to the GP to see if they can refer me to the NHS eye unit, but they said they would not refer me and I don't have a problem. This GP in particular was very patronising and unhelpful.?I have done everything you can think of including optimising my workstation to reduce eyestrain, eye exercises, taking regular breaks, using the 20:20:20 rule.?I even took a week off work and had little to no screen time, but it did little to alleviate the issue. I am now out of ideas. The only thing I can think of next is to ask the optician to refer me to the eye hospital, but I am worried they will have the same opinion as the GP.?HELP! "

Conjunctivitis,Going back to your optian more frequently ,I had an eye test about 6 months go that revealed a small prescription in one eye. I feel the eye has got worse though.

Conjunctivitis,Vision Problems,"Backstory: Recently I went to work at sea on a cruise ship for 6 months aged 36 and when I returned developed a ""floater"" in both eyes but this could just be co incidence and the opticians reassured me floaters are normal and should not be the cause of what I am about to tell you.Okay so when I am playing any videogame now (been playing them all my life with no problems previous whatsoever) and I do anything that has movement...things blur. If the character is running the backgrounds blur. If I rotate the camera the backgrounds blur. If i open up the menu and have a look around the map...it blurs. The faster the movement the more blur.Nobody knows what this is or commented stupid things like ""maybe it was always there and your eyes just saw it and now cant unsee it.

Conjunctivitis,"Sudden vision loss in one eye, need a second opinion","Hi all. About two days ago I noticed I was having trouble seeing out of my right eye. I thought it was just dry or had an irritant in it so I used eye drops and rubbed it a bit. The next morning it had not gone away but I tried to ignore it until today I couldn't take it anymore and saw a corneal specialist.Some background:- I had LASIK 1.5 years ago and since then have had 20/15 in both eyes- I use eye drops regularly since the surgery though I've never suffered uncomfortable dry eyes - it just became habit. I'd say about 2-4 times a day.- I am 24yo female, very healthy and active, no other health problems/allergies.- I used to have an astigmatism. After LASIK, it should have been removed but I believe my LASIK surgeon did not fully correct it for various reasons but I do not have a copy of the records to confirm that.- About 2-3 weeks ago I had an infection (maybe ingrown hair?) about 1.5cm from my right eye. I took 10 days of antibiotics. It was a bad and sudden infection. It has since healed. So today during the visit they did a number of tests. My right eye had dropped to 20-46 or something like that. So while not blind, a huge difference from two days ago. The Dr. said that both my eyes had a very slight astigmatism, and both were a bit dry, so his orders were to use eye drops regularly and come back in two weeks if it doesn't heal.Well.. I told him I really didn't think it was dry eyes since I already use eye drops and why the sudden loss in one eye? The vision loss is significant enough that I cannot perform normally. I cannot read well without strain, getting headache from it, and I feel like I need an eyepatch just to get around. Not only that, but it feels like there is a haze over my right eye, so it makes focusing even harder.Anyway, I am home now and already scheduled for a second opinion tomorrow at a difference practice. But I believe my eyesight has gotten worse already. I am really scared. Could it be infected like the side of my face was? Something residual from that? Or something worse like a tear that he didn't notice? Thank you "
Conjunctivitis,Ghosting issues really afraid :(,"Hey guys over the past few years I'm 21 I've noticed my vision has been off finally de months ago I went to an eye doctor to see what was up .I was born with an astigmatism and strabismus my mom told me when I went to see him I didn't tell him about strabismus part because my mom said they put a patch on me eye and did surgery to correct it.Now he said I had an astigmatism and I needed glasses the glasses help see more clearly but the ghosting isn't helped at all I didn't explain the ghosting issue cuz I think I got it confused with blurryness.After realizing what ghosting wa via online searches I demanded to my doc lol that I get blood tests done and an Mri I have health anxiety as well so I gt an Mri spinal tap blood tests and it came clear they had me do a pin hole test and when I looked through the pin hole the ghosting goes away he said that means it isn't nurel issue and it's an eye issue After doing some more reading my symptoms match kertacounus I'm just super freaked out I know no one here is a doctor but the ghosting happens with objects in high contest backgrounds it's worse on screens but let's say I have an iPod charger sitting on a black couch I will see a partial ghost image of that white charger Funny thing is when I squint my eyes and my nose a bit the ghosting goes away 100 percentSorry for the long rant I see my eye doc again Monday but I've been crying all day cuz I feel it doesn't match up with an astigmatism and I have no answers "

Conjunctivitis,Progressing Nearsightedness and Floater ,"Hi,I have recently noticed about a month ago that when I close my right eye I my vision become blurry the farther a way I look. It felt irritated and a little dry but looked fine in the mirror, not red at all. And since then it is only getting worse. It seems my vision is becoming increasingly near sighted. I went to an eye doctor and they ran a small battery of tests and told me my left eye looked perfect, but were surprised when I mentioned it was bothering me. Since then I went to a hospital and they again did not find anything. This week I noticed a decent size floater in the center of my vision that is big enough to distort my vision. Also by the end of the day everyday my eye feels tired and uncomfortable. Any ideas?"

Conjunctivitis,Glasses suddenly stopped working!,"I have short-sightedness but not to any debilitating extent. My glasses help make everything look sharper but I can function quite comfortably without them. Still, I always wear my glasses to avoid eye strain and headaches.Earlier today I became totally, uncharacteristically engrossed in a book and ended up reading the Kindle for about four hours without any breaks. I never read so intensively for such long periods and after I had finished I realised that everything now seemed blurry. When I took my glasses off my eyesight markedly improved. Now, putting on my glasses renders text in the middle and far distances almost unreadable.Have I damaged my eyesight? This morning my glasses helped me to see, this evening they hinder me. What possibly could have happened? "

Sharp pains behind my eyes and my orbital sockets are tender. Sharp pain on right side of head, extreme light sensitivity (I'm barely typing this) and my eyes water a lot. Not to mention headache in forehead.I have been to 3 neurologists, 1 ophthalmologist (twice) and have had 4 MRIs of brain with and without contrast in the last year (most recent being August). 2 neurologists told me occipital neuralgia and the eye doc said absolutely nothing was wrong.It causes dizziness as well. I was told I have Ménière's disease so I know I have some light sensitivity issues; but could these symptoms also be migraines?? Someone have any suggestions out there? This is hell."

Conjunctivitis,Problem with new glasses ,"Hello, I have mild myopia and astigmatism. My old glasses prescription from 4 years ago (that was unchanged two years ago) was:Left: -1.25 sph, -0.75 cy, 162.5 degrees Right: -1.25 sph, -0.75 cy, 25 degrees.The old glasses have a base curve of ~4.5 and pupillary distance of 60. I have sunglasses of the same prescription with a pd of 59. Both pairs are comfortable to wear.I went for a sight test elsewhere recently and after a bodged first attempt (left eye -1.75, 0.25, 170 that gave me crippling headaches) the new prescription was given asLeft: -1.25, -0.75, 10Right: -1.25, -0.75, 10The pd in the new glasses is 62 and the base curve is 4.Frames are almost identical in size and shape.Vision through each eye is sharp from the new glasses however despite wearing them for a week I had depth perception and distortion problems, specifically the centre of my vision felt too close to me so everything looks flat, I got mild headaches and had the sensation that my eyes were looking in different places...as if I was crossing them or one was looking wide of true. When I took them off I felt like I was looking at a magic eye picture, depth perception and orientation without glasses was upset for over a day after stopping wearing them.The store says the test was done carefully and glasses are within tolerance, so any ideas why I am unable to cope with the change in glasses? Thanks!"
Conjunctivitis,Rhinitis or something else?,"For the last few years I have suffered with intermittent watery eyes - usually one or other. Only in spring / summer months.Since moving to East coast of England 2 years ago I suffer more days than not with both eyes filling.. It is now October and have been suffering since april and things are just as bad!I am in Uk.I start in the morning before getting up with occasional sneezing, some slight plegm in throat, I notice that the watery eye thing is after a day of wearing make up especially eye make up. My nose streams too!However - if I do not wear make up it does not make a great deal of difference immediately. as in next day but definately does do the next day I do not wear it.I did go to the doctor who said it could be a sign of rheumatoid arthritis and if it persists should have a blood test for that.I am wondering if it is allergy to something / rheumatoid arthritis or what?I do have cats - but always have done, the only one thing re the cats is that we took on a new one Oriental with short fur a year or two back who does lie on my bed in the mornings.This condition does go on all day tho until about 6pm and then my eyes usually dry.When bad I have red lower and upper eylids and very slight redness in the whites of my eyes.I do have blue eyes.Any suggetions?

Conjunctivitis,Eyes damaged from eye exam?,"A neuro-ophthalmologist examined my eyes over one month ago. I was first seen by a technician who applied the dilation drops and eye anesthetic. My vision has been worse ever since, particularly in my right eye. I do have mild cataracts, but no diabetes, nor hypertension, and have no narrow angle, did not experience severe pain, nausea, or vomiting, which would be the symptoms of mydriatic-induced acute angle glaucoma. I returned to the MD the week following the eye exam, having been visually disabled due to severe photosensitivity and blurred vision. Initially, I also had mild pain in my right eye following the exam, which subsided over the course of three weeks. What remains is the excessively blurred vision, photosensitivity, and blurriness. The MD told me there was no explanation, and sent me on my way.The degree of dilation kept increasing over the course of hours. I had a 40-minute drive home, which I had to do, although I kept pulling off the road until there were no cars. (There was no one to help). I had had a heavy object fall on the right side of my head a few days prior to the exam, and advised the MD about it. I had not lost consciousness, but it was a sturdy blow.I have been coping with it by wearing sunglasses, and cannot be in retail stores without them, due to the off-gassing from the light fixtures. Emotionally? Tonight is a night where I feel so leveled by this - after all, my vision was not like this before the exam. I wonder if this is a subtle form of acute angle glaucoma which could be caused by the dilation drops. (It was not atropine).Because this MD advised there was nothing she could do, I have an appointment with another ophthalmologist in one month. Frankly, I had hoped I would not need to keep that appointment, but, here it is, one entire month with this, and tonight, it is really getting me down. Any thoughts? Thank you. "
Conjunctivitis,Cloudy film on one eye.,I woke up one morning as if short sighted in one eye. I had cataract operations on each eye about two years ago and have had no problems apart from dry eyes for a time after the procedure.Consultant said that my eyes are perfect and put problem down to a cloudy film and dryness on that eye.I have been using preservative free Hylo-Tear on that eye for about four weeks without any improvement. Does anyone have suggestions of a better treatment or other drops to use ?

Conjunctivitis,Shadow-like anomalies in peripheral vision,"Hello everyone,I am a male, 23 and I' ve noticed quite a strange thing about my vision. First of all, i should mention that i do feel migraine-like aches above/behind my eyes on occasions. Not everyday, but certainly often enough. I have also recently developed a PVD along with some floaters, went to check my eyes, ophtomologist couldn't find any sign of retinal detachment or anything similar and said that my ocular pressure is perfect.BUT - the strange thing that i experienced maybe around six months ago or so is that strange phosphene-like shadow thing in both my eyes, maybe a bit more pronounced on the left one. Its pretty much the same thing as if you pushed an eye with your finger and seeing that shadow, but it also became apparent when lifting my head all the way up and looking above and even a bit further (as if you'd wanna throw a ball above your head and looking back) I see bow-like shadow right down in my peripheral vision like two black half-circles with a bright shadow around it, again - like a phosphene. It is also apparent when my sight is fixed on something and i start quickly rotating my head. I see it on the sides, as well like shadowy dots.I should also mention that i suffer from a bit lower blood pressure than normal, but not significantly. Around 55 bpm. Could it be due to a low pressure or something else? I would really appreciate if someone knew what that thing i described could be, i can even try to draw a picture of what it looks like and send it to you.Thanks in advance!"

Conjunctivitis,If not glaucoma then what else?,"Hi, so I am 19 years old and have experienced a number of visual disturbances over the last few years, the most notable being that I see large halos and rainbow halos around lights at night. Naturally when they started to bother me I googled causes of it, and glaucoma was the overwhelming response. I made an appointment with an ophthalmologist, who I have now seen three times over the last six months, each time him telling me my eyes look perfectly healthy and I do not have glaucoma. Given that he is a very well-respected ophthalmologist who specialises in glaucoma I am inclined to believe him. But if not glaucoma then what else could be causing this? He also told me he saw no sign of cataracts (something else he specialises in). I am starting to feel like a crazy person but the halos have gotten worse recently and I just can't believe that this is just a normal phenomenon that my eyes are experiencing. To give some context about my eyes I have essentially 20/20 vision (mild long sightedness in my left eye), haven't lost any central or peripheral vision (at least not yet), but I am very light sensitive and see a lot of floaters. Any help/suggestions would be much appreciated, thankyou."

Conjunctivitis,Dry Eye - problem with treatment,"Hi,I am being treated now for dry eye. The problem has gone on for some years. A few years ago I went to a well known optician chain and the optician claimed I needed varifocals. I persevered for over a year but it felt like the wrong prescription plus I was taking off the glasses to read - I could read perfectly without them. I also felt the prescription for short sightedness in the right eye was wrong. The optician denied this and tried minutely different prescriptions. The long and the short of it, I tried them but nothing worked after going back several times and I felt my time and money was being wasted by the constant flippant denials. Of course I was concentrating on the prescription. In the end I asked for just lenses for short sightedness and lost the money I had paid for varifocals. Roll forward a couple of years and I woke up with a painful eye, sensitivity to light etc. I went to another optician who after examination gave me preservative free drops Thealoz Duo and wrote to my GP who arranged for a hospital appointment. Luckily I do not have scarring as the optician thought but I do have dry eyes, severe in one eye. I found Hycosan the best although I've been prescribed Hylo Tear. I couldn't get on with the latter. It felt too thick and sticky and made my eye sore, so I've swapped back to Hycosan. However perhaps because I've got quite narrow eyes close to my nose, I'm having trouble finding a happy medium of keeping the eyes lubricated (I some times have used gel as well but I'm trying to do without) and not feeling as if I have a slight cold or it going in my throat. I do wash my eyes whenever I can and also use a heated eye mask which is very soothing. But the whole thing is very tiring. I do of course, to say the least, that the carelessness of a major optician's chain has cost me two or so years and allowed a deterioration which could have been caught earlier. But my concern is getting my eyes on track and taking the physical strain off myself (I am still waiting for a new prescription as I've had to use the drops for several months first to see if it affects the prescription in the right eye). I'd appreciate any help and/or other people's similar experiences and how they dealt with it?

The problem:Every morning I wake up with terribly red eyes and my eyes feel all sore and tired. Not that I have pus in my eyes at all, atleast not more than normal people do.I get better during the day, but my eyes are really red all day and it looks like im ill or have just cried or something. Its really annoying and impossible to look people in the eyes, as you may understand. My eyes are really itchy during the morning and night (often at 20-21 o clock) even though I have slept 7-10 eyes a night – the symptoms stays the same. The itchy part in my eyes is mostly in my inner eyes (closest to nose) and outer eye (closest to ear).My eyes feel very irritated for light and wind, I’m not sure if its “normal” as it feel like ages since I had my “normal” eyes. Normally when I drink alcohol you get red eyes, I understand that, however when I just drink 1 or 2 beers I get incredible red eyes, as in really red and no “white” in my eyes is to spot at all. Not sure why this happens, but might be a clue to the problem. Maybe important to inform you, that this is in both of my eyes. Also when looking into my eyes it seems that its only in vertical to iris and under iris which is red, above iris it seems to be all normal and white. Need to tell also, when I am on vacation in other countries for 2 or 3 weeks, it’s the same issue. I haven’t had 1 single day where I wake up and my eyes seems fine.What I have done / medicines:I have seen several eye doctors during the past 2½ years and tried lots of different eye drops. Every doctor seems to believe its some kind of allergic reaction, however what I have learnt, is if it’s a allergic reaction I will not be same symptoms and issues every single day, so I start to believe it must be something else. I started trying Opatanol, which is some kind of allergic eye drops, combined with some “dry eyes” eye drops, I believe it was Visine or something. These dry eyes, eyes drops helped moisturing my eyes, however doesn’t seem to have any effect at all. Then I have tried Vexol and Spersadex, which a some eye drops with binyrebarkhormon, which helps a lot on the itching in my eyes and also seems to ease the redness in my eyes, at least for a day or so, however whenever I stop with this it all return again. Actually whenever I wake up from sleep it all seems to be “back to square one”. After a couple of sessions two different eye doctors simply didn’t knew what to do, after trying more kind of eye drops including Zaditen, eye gel for the night and viscotears during the day. Anyways I went to a doctor to check if I was allergic to something and it turns our im allergic cat, dogs, pollen and dust mites. As desperate as I am ive got to get rid of the pollen and dust mites allergic, so I went to weekly injections of same and sooner or later I would be “immune” to pollen and mites allergic. However this seems to not have any effect at all either. I moved to Norway for 7 months ago and bought new apartment. I need to mention I have bought several of new pillows, bed and sheets. No help there. I saw an eye doctor in Norway and told them about the issue I have and suggested of course same allergic medicins as I have tried already. However I read an article about Ocular Rosacea (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2358570/Sore-bloodshot-eyes-A-hidden-skin-problem-blame.html), which might cause eye issues as well as skin issues. I have for 2 weeks been on a Tetracyclin which might cause this issue, but didn’t seem to have any effect either. I have not been on any eye drops for the past couple of weeks and my eyes a killing me. I know this is a bad thing, but I really need either Vexol or Spersadex to keep me going, even though its really bad to use on long-term basis. Anyways, desperate as I am, I am now looking for help online or other people who might have experienced same issues as I have. I really desperate to solve this issue I have, which affects me daily and really don’t stop thinking about what it could be that causes this problem. P.s. I apologize for the bad English, if anything above isn’t explained properly, please just let me know. RegardsMads "
Conjunctivitis,Is it harmful for the eyes flying by plane?,"Hello everyone, I have been experiencing floaters the last few years and got checked by the doctor who told me that there's no detachment and it's because of the vitreous humor ( gel ). So I'm wondering if I should travel by plane without concerns regarding the fact that when you're flying you're experiencing the ""pressure"" in the cabin. Could this be a reason to cause some kind of damage to my eyes? Thank you very much for your time.

Conjunctivitis,Glaucoma ,Presently I am using Travatan once a day in the evening. Earlier I used Azopt also along with Travatan. The Doc told me to use Systane (eye lubricant) 5 mins after Travatan/ Azopt eye drops. I have an apprehension that using systane 5-10 mins after the actual eye drops of Glaucoma may wash away their effects.Second point is that Travatan is to be used in the evening. Should it be used at bed time or an hr or so before going to bed.Can I have the views on the above issues.
Conjunctivitis,Yellowness in unexposed part of sclera,"okay so this all started with one single red spot in my right eye. The next day my left eye was red when i pulled down my eyelid. Over the next few days that went away but i not have orange/yellowish discoloration in the part of my sclera thats not exposed. Theres no bumps or anything but everytime i pull down its slightly yellow/orangish and theres random veins going everywhere. It honestly looks dirty but not brown kinda dirty. My inner lower eyelid also has these red veins in them that creates a circle. all these eye changes followed symptoms such as chest pain, muscle pain and weakness, fatigue, extreme everyday headaches, cough for more than 3 weeks, and multiple other symptoms. Could this be jaundice? Its not yellow in the part of rhe sclera thats visible tho. Like when i look left and right they become visible but if im looking straight on u can barely see the yellow. But when i pull my lid down in natural lighting its got this tinge of yellow and vessles are going everywhere in ever direction some pink some blue. Its just worrisome bc of all my symptoms. Ive also had swelling in ankles and distended stomach. Ive done some tests and am waiting for results but i didnt see the eye thing until a week and a half ago so i havent mentioned that to my gp yet. What could it be? "
Conjunctivitis,Floaters - any solutions? ,"At the end of July I had Lasik eye surgery. I now have fast moving floaters in both eyes, which are seriously impacting on my life. I have had a follow up examination which has shown no cause for concern, apparently I have just been unlucky. The consultant said they should drop to the bottom of my eye with time, but this could take many years. It is hard to adapt to them when they are flying across my line of vision everytime I move my head. I have researched many solutions via Google, all with mixed reviews. I am currently taking a range of natural health supplements, including serrapteme enzyme. But wonder if this will all be in vain, due to the enclosed nature of the virtreous gel. I have read positive reviews about ""msm & silver drops"" but am worried about putting drops in my eyes 2 months after surgery. I was wondering if anybody could shed light on anything that has worked for them? Many thanks "
Conjunctivitis,"What's up with my eyes, so depressed","Hi all,for the last two months I've been having real issues with my eyes. I first started to notice there was a problem when they felt slightly swollen on the top eyelid on waking. The swelling would go down withina an hour, hour and a half, but then they still continued to feel irritaed throughout the day. I then started to notice a dry, very, very slightly red, patchy ""arch"" around the outer area of my eye below my eyebrow. This dryness is not anywhere on the immediate eyelid area itself. I went to my GP who told me to use a mild steroid cream (great help) as he thought it was mild eczema due to the hot weather. I decided not to use it as it's quite dangerous to put that stuff near the near.I struggled on, sometimes wearing eye makeup, sometimes not in order to give my eyes a break yet the problems have persisted. When I say eye irritation, i mean,dry, itchy, sometimes stinging and burning. I went to the optiians and had an eye test. She said my tears were evapourating really quickly, like 4 - 5 seconds which is bad for someone of my age, so diganosed dry eye and prescribed eye drops. I've been using these for a few days now and they have helped slightly. However, I'd like to know what the underlying issue could be. I was concerned it was blepharitis as my eyes are itchy along the lash area but no inflammation was seen. However I had not been wearing eye makeup so thought perhaps it might have cleared because of that - would it be possible for blepharitis to clear within a couple of days of not wearing eye make up?My main questions are theseDoes this sound like blepharitis? I really hope it isn't as the maintenace e.g. no make up sounds like hellWoul;d dry eye cause a dry skin arch around the outer area of my eye?What causes dry eye? I work on a computer all day but now take regular screen breaks. I've seen that blepharitis is a main underlying cause of dry eye so what else could this be.I've also noticed that my eyelids have started to get more oily. Not massively but there's a sheen. I can't work out whether this has come from my facial moisturiser or whether this is a new thing. I don't suffer from acne but my face can be quite shiny in other areas. Could this be the cause?I know the best advice is to go to my GP but they're so usless with everything. And I know I'll have to fight to see a dermatologist. Any advice/comments/help would be greatly appreciated. FYI - I'm female, 28, work in an office. Don't wear glasses or contact and have perfect 20/20 vision. Thanks. "
Conjunctivitis,Should i be worried about eye damage from bright sunlight eventhough my eyes were closed?,I was washing my dishes with the bright sunlight from my window were striking the kitchen sink with full effect.It was uncomfortable but the problem worsened when i started washing stainless steel utensils which reflected the sunlight with full intensity into my eyes.Even though my eyes were closed during the duration of the cleaning of the steel dishes i still felt a heavy streak of bright light flashing in my eye.This happened a couple more times.Although i didnt feel much discomfort immediately i started getting eye fatigue and slight tearing of eyes a few hours later.Now my worry is whether the bright light could have done any kind of eye damage since i have read that uv rays can penetrate the eye eventhough it was closed.

Conjunctivitis,Eye color changes,"A month ago I noticed my eye color changed, I am so depressed about it, my whole life people were telling me how beautiful my eyes are and how special they are.. I used to have blue-grey eyes, and when I look at old pictures that is the color I used to have, now I have green eyes with a bit of brown color around the pupil and some brown on the iris. I am 17 years old. Any chance my eyes will get back to what they used to be like ? Maybe it because I spent a lot of time exposed to the sun ?No idea what I should do I wish I could have my eyes back..."
Conjunctivitis,Sight loss help please!,About 18months ago I lost my sight in my left eye for approx 2weeks. Then it gradually returned to about 95%. The GP thought MS but the neurologist turned me away. So I was discharged with no help 2 weeks ago my sight went again in the same eye it is slowly returning any ideas of what could be causing this? It is starting to worry me and the GP just says to wait and see what happens! I hope someone may have some ideas as I think I will have to go with some idea of what it may be and ask them to refer me. Thank you all in advance

Conjunctivitis,HELP! AM I MAKING IT WORSE?,"Hello all, Thank you for taking the time to look at my post.Four days ago my 18-month-old daughter accidentally stuck her finger up into my left eye. Literally under the eyelid.. It all happened in an instant and the pain was excruciating; runner-up if not the worst I've ever felt.I visited the ER as soon as my wife got home because I couldn't drive myself sooner, The doctor put some pain drops and something I'm going to call highlighter-ish drops in my eye, flipped my upper eyelid up, looked at it under a black light and said ""Wow, she got you good"".Then he tells me she got my eyelid really good and she scratched my eye a bit too. He prescribed me some Vicoprofen And some antibiotic ointment for my eyeball.I've been putting slight pressure against my eye with a clean rag with an ice cube in it ever since I got home to help with the pain; now that I can finally open my eye for short periods at a time my vision is extremely blurry.I'm still keeping it closed the majority of the time as it is less painful closed. Should I try keeping it open for longer periods even though it hurts for eye-health reasons?here's a picture: http://imgur.com/VM8ezebThe pharmacist told me that the ointment would make my eye blurry for about 15 minutes but I'm experiencing blurry vision out of that eye all day.Basically what I'm asking is did I hurt my vision more by putting pressure and ice?Will my vision ever return? Should i hold my eye open even though it hurts? I've never had vision problems in my life!Thanks in advance for any help or advice you may have to offer! "
Conjunctivitis,Diagnosed with 'eye pressure'--/ worried!,"Hi all,So when I went to the opticians the other day my optician tested my eye pressure and said it was high/higher than usual. It was my first time with the air puffs. It was 21 and 22 pressure in the eye.She is referring me for a hospital appointment (in 6 weeks) just for a cornea measurement etc.However it's stressing me out as I'm worried that the eye pressure could be caused due to a brain tumour or some other neurological disease. I'm also worried it could lead to blindness (I'm 19). Does anyone else have this 'eye pressure' and know what it can cause or mean? I'm too stressed out to wait 6 weeks to find out. Any help will be appreciated. Thank you. "
Conjunctivitis,Retinal tear,"i had a retinal tear and haemorraging in left eyes about 3 months ago.. I had laser treatment for this..my right eye then went the following month, no tear just bleeding from pulling on blood vessels. Both eyes still have floaters but left eye is worse, like I'm looking through a black sieve with tiny holes and at night I feel I'm wearing dark sunglasses in the house. Opthamologist checked and said this will settle down in time!! It's really scary as I had good vision before this. Eyes are very sensitive to bright light. Has anyone had this before and can you tell me when this should all settle down. Thanks"
Conjunctivitis,Optic nerve Issue/Field Vision Test,"Hello, I had my annual eye exam last Thursday. I hadn't had one in a couple years. I have very bad nearsightedness- my numbers are -6.50 and -5.75. Other than bad eyesight, my health history is completely negative. I've never had any other diagnoses and have never been prescribed meds of any kind. (I'm 28 just for reference). I've always been blessed with good health thus far. Never had high blood pressure, diabetes, glaucoma, or anything that might put me at risk for eye issues.I had my eyes dilated at the eye appt and the puff of air glaucoma test. She initially said everything looked good after checking my eyes after dilation, but then paused and asked if other optometrists had ever mentioned I had a ""strange shaped"" right optic nerve. I said no. She asked if I had ever had a traumatic injury to my right eye to which I said no. She then took me to another room to take photos of my right eye which she showed me. She said there was a ""spot"" on part of the optic nerve and it was strange and she had never seen anything like it before. She said it could be I had an injury and was unaware, or I could have been born with a strange shaped optic nerve. She then casually said in rare cases it could be a tumor, and then continued on with the convo like she hadn't just terrified me out of my mind. She said she was scheduling me for a field vision test (which I've never had) on Monday and based on those results she may or may not refer me to an opthamologist. Now, I'm a registered nurse and I consider myself very level headed and reasonable, but understandably so I have been a nervous wreck this weekend. The optometrist truly didn't seem too concerned, but just her mere casual mention of ""tumor"" has sent me into a tailspin of anxiety and fear and Google searches (terrible idea). She says all this to me then cheerily sends me on my way to the front desk to schedule the field vision test. The reasonable person in me says chances are it's nothing serious because she would have sent me to the hospital or opthamologist straight away if she deemed it serious, but I am almost having an anxiety attack now that's it's been 3 days of sitting here dwelling on her words. Advice from anyone? Anyone experience anything similar or had to have a field vision test? Just looking for any words to calm my nerves until after my field vision test tomorrow.

Conjunctivitis,"Rare eye condition, doctors don't know cannot detect anything wrong","So, I am embarrassed to even talk about this, as this condition is solely caused by me. It started when I was about 7 or 8 years old, I am now 22. I am of Asian descent, when I was younger, I used to get bullied and teased a lot because of my eyes and my chubbiness. I have done things in attempt to alter my physical image to please others, especially my mother, whom has always been very critical of my appearance, esp. my small eyes.In regards to my weight, I have eaten significantly less and exercise a lot as a young kid; I am now quite skinny. My parents think that I got appendicitis because of losing weight.In order to make my eyes ""bigger,"" every day (until I felt is was damaged) I would vigorously roll my eyes in circular motion (not with my fingers/ hands, just how someone would roll their eyes, but I did it quickly, persistently and repeatedly, almost forcibly, with my eyeballs moving in a clockwise circular fashion continually sometimes for 10 minutes or more. I did this in my bedroom, on the bus to school, and in the restroom.In between these routines, my mom once remarked that she noticed my eyes got bigger, so I continue to practice this eye routine until one day, I felt something ""snapped"" behind my left eyeball. Since then, I was able to ""feel"" or sense movement and what I feel to be sensory nerves that may be connected to my brain and the left side of my body, specifically my left hand. It is hard to describe,but I feel like I can feel what is behind my eye; surely something has become torn or damaged.Whenever I feel movement behind my left eye, my fingers on my left hand are susceptible to this ""sensation,"" like it is something that is perceptible by touch. All the eye doctors from private practice and the hospitals did not see anything wrong when they looked into/ behind my left eye. They suggest that this problem could possibly be due to the dryness of the eye, so they prescribed eye drops.When I put the drops in my left eye, I could literally feel the liquid entering inside, and it really scares me. I am still scared because I don't know if I can ever be normal again. My family did know of my eye condition before, but once the doctors told them that they could not detect anything wrong, they all think I'm lying about my eye. Ever since then, I pretended that I was alright and my eye condition was gone. Now, only my older sister and my brother know that it has never gone away.Perhaps, there is a nerve pertinent to the brain got damaged? I do not know. I researched on the internet to seek any conditions related to what I have, and could find none. I feel really stupid of what I have done to myself, but I am also really afraid and would like to get to the bottom of this problem. I need recommendations of someone who is able to help me."

Conjunctivitis,Possible malpractice?,"Hi,I just got back from the ER in Canada because of a foreign body in the back of my left eye.As I spoke to the doctor there very quickly I sensed that he didn't like me, that he wanted to get rid of me as soon as possible (note that I am a foreigner)He put a cotton swab into my eye, and said that he removed a foreign body but that I would have to see an ophtalmologist, because he didn't have a magnifying glass to check whether there were smaller bodies also present.I didn't think much of it at first, and I couldn't tell whether I had anything left in my eye because of all he put in it but then I wondered, is it possible for an emergency department not to have a magnifying glass for that purpose?And now that I am back home I can feel that the foreign body is there exactly as before, as if he had done nothing. Ever since the beginning I felt one large body and I still feel the same.Is it possible that he removed something and that I still feel the presence of one large body, even though he supposedly removed a large one and that all that should be left would be smaller ones invisible to the naked eye? And is it possible for an emergency department not to have a magnifying glass for this kind of intervention?As another possibly relevant note, when I asked him whether my eyesight would get back to normal soon he responded ""sure it will"", but the nurse that was also present at the time made him make sure that I was actually able to read text from a piece of paper.Am I right to suspect malpractice from him, and if so what do you suggest I should do?Thank you,Leo"

Conjunctivitis,anyone ever have conjunctivochalasis and did surgery help,"Conjunctivochalasis is where you have too much skin in your conjunctiva and it becomes wrinkled. It can lead to irritation of eyelids, watering and to dry eye. Feels like a foreign body sensation is in your eye and convential dry eye treatment dont work because the wrinkled skin cause tears to move away from the eye. Again did anyone have this. And did surgery work. "

Conjunctivitis,"Irritated eye, pain around it, seeing strange things.","I've had an irritated eye for quite some time now. Over a month, actually. I went to an optician about it, but he couldn't find anything wrong. It kind of feels dry a lot of the time and hurts randomly. I also see strange things. When I'm resting on my bed, stuff that wasn't there in my field of vision before suddenly just pops up. e.g. crack in the wall. I'm watching tv, and suddenly I just notice it again. Sometimes, my vision turns black for an instant and is normal again. Its annoying me a lot.What could this possibly be? I'm certain that its not an infection since I've had it for over a month, and I've seen an optician about it. I don't think its a detached retina either, since I don't have a lot of the other symptoms, although at one point in time during the last month I did see an instance of a flashing light and had 3 sharp, quickly passing pains in my eyes in the span of a few seconds. However, they haven't shown up again. I'm pretty worried right now. Please help. "

Conjunctivitis,Stye bump,"16 days ago I started to have a red pimple under my eye that was painfull. A week later - a doctor said it was a stye and gave me some antibiotic gel. I also used hot compresses but for a short time (like twice a day for 2 minutes ) at this point the pimple became to a bump.2 weeks later the bump doesn't hart anymore and doesn't go awayI started to do the hot compress for 3 times a day- 20 minutes each timeMy question is- if it doesn't hurt anymore, is there any reason to continue with hot compresses? (since it doesn't change anything) Is it too late??How long should I wait until a surgery to drain it?Can it still go away by itself even though it looks the same size?Thanka"
Conjunctivitis,problems with eyes for 4 years,"Hi all, so my problem is that I love gaming but i get dry eyes fast and my eyesight I would say isn't ""clean"" and sometimes when I'm looking in long distance I see dots in the picture I see.Interesting when im not wearing glases I dont get dry eyes also when i'm playing games with sun glasses my eyes in most cases dont get dry.I have very sensitive eyes when looking at wet surfaces when sun is reflecting from them, intersting I can look at snow all winter long with no problems.I have feeling that there is something wrong with my glasses or eyes or both? I tried to solve the problem by setting my computer screen to 0 (min.) and contrast to 100 (max.) and it was a bit better but not as I expected. I tried playing with sun glasses and in some cases it got better in some cases it got worse (depending on game). Also white colour from websites, word etc. is too much even with brightness set on 0.Please tell me what I am doing wrong, what can I do to save my eyes? I know this can't go on that way.(sorry for my bad english)"

Conjunctivitis,Pease help!! ,"Hello, I have for a few years now been experiencing the awful inconvenience of my eyes watering profusely when I step outside. I am 16 years old and this causes me great embarrassment and annoyance on a daily basis. I find that due to the copious amount of tears from my eyes causes the outer corner to become red, stinging and sensitive which is so unpleasant ! I am aware watering eyes is common but am yet to receive much information on how to lessen or preferably get rid of the problem altogether. I am getting to a desperate stage as to how I stop this so any help would be wonderful. Also note that my eyes water whether or not it is windy and sunglasses is a solution which does not combat this problem for me personally.Thank you so much,Lauren."

Conjunctivitis,Allergic conjunctivitis/ dry eyes ,"HiI'm atopic (asthma, hayfever, skin allergies)About 10 years ago, I was self conscious that my eyes didn't look white. Used cosmetic whitening drops, which probably kick started issues as I guess I reacted with the preservatives in them. Saw opthalmologist who gave me sodium cromoglicate, a mast cell stabiliser.8 years ago, noticed swelling under the eye. Referred to opthalmologist who said it was blepharitis (though no crust lids, recommend lid hygiene)Had ongoing issues, with watery eyes and slightly red eye for a few years.So fast forward recently. My eyes have felt ok, rarely used drops or hygiene.Had real mad inflammation and sticky discharge in eyes . Thought it was bacterial conjunctivitis, so used chloramphenicol and restarted cromoglicate and lid wipes.Didn't do much.Went to opthalmologist who gave me Opatanol (olaptadine), 6 weeks Prednisolone 0.5% , 3 weeks Hyabak lubricant, ongoing The steroids helped immediately, my eyes never looked so white or felt so good.Once they stopped, the opatanol worked a bit.So now I'm back to lid care, hyabak and when needed, cromoglicate.6 week follow up they said my eyes were better, still a little inflammation and to continue with lubricant.Tiday, I wake with red eyes again, slight discharge of mucus. Really upset and frustrated . Have booked another opthalmologist The eyes have calmed a little in last 6 hours with cromoglicate and lubricate. They don't feel itchy, they're not watery, no pain, no blurred vision, no photophobia, etcI don't know what else to do"

Conjunctivitis,Testing for D3 level,"My Ophthamalogist just ordered a D3 test. I was surprised, as I am always out in the sun. I am a Nurse, so I looked this up and discovered that he must be thinking SARCOIDOSIS. This affects the eyes (Blurred vision, Sensitivity to light, Eye pain and itching, Burning and redness, Tears, Inflammation), and you can develop Granulomas. I actually have 3 Pyogenic Granulomas on my leg, abdomen and chest, recently. This finally makes sense. My instincts were telling me that there was some underlying disease process going on and this wasn't simply dry eyes. For years I have known that I have Lagophthalmos. My eye lids don't close all the way when I close my eyes, which contributes to dry eyes. I just wanted to share this with others who might be thinking that they don't simply have dry eyes."
Conjunctivitis,Has anyone also experienced rainbow coloured aura around object????,"For a while now, I've been seeing what could be described as a rainbow coloured aura around objects and text that also resembles double vision in that if I'm looking at text, I can see a faint ghosting version of it within the aura. If I'm looking at the outline or edge of something white, there is a greater saturation of rainbow colours in the aura as opposed to looking at a darker coloured object where the effect is lessened. If I look through a pin hole or squint, this corrects the problem almost entirely. The aura can get worse if my eyes are tired.I guess it could be described as a vertical Chromatic Aberration of some kind Any idea of what it may be? Has anyone experienced it as well? "

Conjunctivitis,Recurring blurriness in left eye,"Basically, I was outside and felt a sudden pain in my left eye. At first I thought it was something that got in it but I couldn't find anything and I've had this feeling before so it didn't concern me too much. For the first few hours, my vision was fine although I had eye pain. Unfortunately, I started to get occasional blurry vision and the thing that truly concerns me is that I can see a film over my eye. It goes away after blinking almost instantly and my vision is perfectly fine pretty much.I've had this issue in the past where I see a film over my eye but it seems to be occurring more than in the past. This is Day 12 since I first had the eye pain, I saw my GP about it and he didn't feel it was too much of a concern. Now I feel like I may have missed something and done permanent damage to my eye. If the blurriness is episodic like this, I can live with it but I'm afraid it'll turn into something worse. Don't want to go to the eye doc if I don't have to, but I don't know if this is worth the visit seeing as I went a month ago and everything was fine. Could it be dry eyes or something else?"
Conjunctivitis,Contact Complications," #1 04-27-2016 12:13 AM by Chickenlady4321Hi I am 22 years old. Awhile back I went to the eye doctors and had gotten a new prescription for my contacts and glasses. I have been using both for years. I was diagnosed with an astigmatism this time around. I got my glasses and they are wonderful and crisp, but I just recently got my new contacts and wore them and I can hardly read anything. It's like night and day for the difference between my contacts and my glasses. I have never experienced this problem before. And I noticed it isn't just one eye. It is both. I can even close one eye and then the other and see that they are both just as bad, so I don't think it has anything to do with my astigmatism. Also made sure I have the contacts in the right eyes and they are. It just amazes me how much better my glasses are. Any suggestions?"

Conjunctivitis,dry eye,Does anyone with dry eye syndrome get pains in there eyes x
Conjunctivitis,Can see pulse beating in vision,Thinking it is from anxiety. I can actually see it corresponds with heart beat.
Conjunctivitis,My eye condition has experts stumped,"It started about two years ago . . . My right eye would always have a sticky liquid substance covering it, making vision very blurry… As if looking through a wet glass. Also, about every hour, my eyelid would be ""glued"" shut due to the hardening of the sticky substance. About a year later, the same condition has affected my left eye. I can no longer drive because of this condition and it is really bumming me out.I have been to six ophthalmologists and six optomologists. Some doctors tell me it is paradoxical dry eyes. Others tell me it is an eye infection. Others tell me that it is pinkeye. I have followed their instructions for treating dry eyes. I have taken several types of medication for an eye infection. I have taken various drops for pinkeye.Nothing helps. I do not know what to do next. My co-pays for eye doctors are quite expensive. I would hope that modern medicine would be able to treat such a condition. Am I being misdiagnosed? I would love to drive out to see my son and daughter who live in adjoining states, but cannot do so.I am a male, 70 years of age, borderline diabetes, stage IV kidney disease, and borderline high blood pressure.Can someone please offer me advice?Thank you, Dennis"
Conjunctivitis,Visual floaters: Please help! ,"A little history on me: I'm 21/F. I have generalized anxiety, panic disorder, depression, PCOS, TMJ, and IBSD. These are all issues I have been dealing with. Medication list: Prozac (20 mg). Vitamin D (5,000 IU). Vitamin B12 injection (once a month). Iron (324 mg). Birth control. Ativan (.05 as needed).My vision has changed since the beginning of this year. I now see small, clear halos when looking at bright, solid surfaces (such as the sky, walls, etc). I also see an odd wave, jelly-like substance when looking at similar surfaces. When I squint my eyes, I see a line of 20 small dots. All of the floaters I have mentioned move in an odd way, like they're falling. When I try to focus on them, my eyes make the floaters ""jump"" back to the top of my vision, only to begin falling again. These always look different (never the same spots or lines) and occur in both eyes. When I am focusing on something, such as the TV, I see random dots in my peripheral vision, but when I look in that direction there is nothing there. Went to the eye doctor, said everything looked fine, I am near sighted, and any disturbances were occular migranes. I have had three occular migranes, where I can very clearly see rainbow lines in my vision. These occur when I have gotten very worked up/anxious and only last a few seconds. The floaters I have previously mentioned occur ALL the time. I can look at the sky at any time during daylight, and see them. Brought these issues up to my general practioner and said this was nothing to worry about, but keep an eye on it. When looking down or look around quickly, I feel a visual dizziness and off-balance. PLEASE, if you have any information on what the possible causes of these disturbances/floaters could be, let me know. My doctors aren't worried, but I 100% am. I'm young, why am I having eye issues? I don't wear contacts and only wear glasses when driving. Please ask me any questions for clarification or further details. ANY information would be beyond appreciated! Thank you! "
Conjunctivitis,Can opticians detect alzheimers?,"Iv`e mentioned that my optician gave me a letter to give my gp`s surgery earlier this week. Iv`e just had a scary thought. Iv`e read that an eye examination can show early alzheimers, & now I`m terrified that the optician thinks that I have alzheimers!"
Conjunctivitis,When I look down to read the text on my shirt,"It's out of focus somewhat with two eyes but when I use one eye, it's not? Should I be concerned?"
Conjunctivitis,"My eye somehow changed colour, and I want my old colour back","Almost a year ago I had blue eyes so light they were almost white. Few months ago I noticed a bit of a change in them, now I have a red-ish circle around my black dot(the black dot in the center of the eye, forgot how it's called). Now I am wondering is this natural, or some kind of sickness, and if it can or cannot be cured. And I'd love to have my old colour back if possible. I'd put up here a picture, but I don't think this forum allows it."
Conjunctivitis,Any young people here with eye floaters not caused by PVD etc?,"I have several floaters in my eyes which my optician cannot observe as they are apparently in the ""pre macular"" area, making them highly mobile and visible.They are all translucent strands/dots, apart from the odd one which has a light brown colouring.I've had them about 2 months and am 24 - I do not think these type of floaters can be tuned out/ignored due to their size mobility and positioning.Has anybody else here of a similar age experienced these Crystallised type floaters? Managed to cope?I'm going insane I think! "
Conjunctivitis,problems with the back of my eyes.,"Iv`e just had a routine eye check, & although the optician said my eyes are healthy, she`s noticed some changes to the backs of my eyes since my last test. She gave me a letter for my gp, & said that I might need a hospital appointment. She told me not to worry because these changes might be a normal part of aging, but I`m terrified. What could be wrong?"
Conjunctivitis,Going insane! Positive advice only please,"Hi everybodyHave had a few floaters in my eyes since I was a teen and they have never bothered me - up until the last 2 weeks!Have had my eyes tested and they are, thankfully, the completely normal harmless kind - optician says he thinks they are more mobile now which is why I am noticing them ALL THE TIME!I probably have about 4/5 in each eye and they are constantly swirling around in my line of vision, I'm finding it very hard to ignore them.Any positive stories from people who have them and have learnt to successfully ignore them to the point where they don't see them? Anyone found they DONT get much worse with age?I'm only 26 so praying this isn't the case!Thanks for any comments"
Conjunctivitis,What treatment were you given for Dry eye?,"Started getting symptoms about a month ago,blurriness is my main complaint. Opthamologist said upper eyelids looked like blocked oil glands. Anyway I am supposed to do 3-1000 mg fish oil a day,3 warm compresses a day plus refresh optive eyedrops 3 to 4 times a day. I have one of those eye masks you can heat,used it first time today,more cloudy and blurry. What do you think of the heat compress,does it work? What is your treatment regiment? This is driveing me nuts,thanks. I recently started takeing an extra 0.5 xanex a day per doctor,maybe that caused the imbalance. I take it daily."
Conjunctivitis,"Dry eyes, looks like I have black eyes","I am currently 19 and this problem has been torturing me everyday for around 6 years now. Underneath my eyes, even more so under my right eye, it looks as if I have a black eye. They are always irritated and feel dry, there are small bumps where the blackish/purpilish color appears. I am very self-concious about this, and ever since the problem began, almost everyday someone would ask what happened to my eyes. I don't know what to do. I've tried taking allergy pills, eyedrops, I have a healthy diet and I am very active. I have hated going into public for the past 6 years because of how bad I feel about myself, so I stay isolated as often as possible. Please if anyone can identify my problem and provide a solution, you would change my life."
Conjunctivitis,Blurriness in left edge of left eye ,"About a week ago I was sat watching TV and all of a sudden the left edge of my left eye went fuzzy, this passed after about half an hour and ever since the same area has been blurry.

Conjunctivitis,Eye floaters....argh!,"Hi everyone,I know people have posted about eye floaters before but am just looking for someadvice from people who actually have these rather than my optician who just wants to get me out of his office!Not had them long - about a month or so. Very mobile little things and very difficult to not focus on as I keep getting told. Does this get easier with time? Do they honestly ever become much less noticeable/not seen?Particularly the ones that bounce around in your line of vision 24/7? No horror stories please!Just wanted people to share their experiences .... Preferably good ones lolDee x "
Conjunctivitis,Eye injection treatments,I have been diagnosed with branch retinal vein occlusion with macular oedema and don't know which treatment is better - monthly Lucentis injections or Steroid implant. Scared of both and the side effects. Has anyone had either?
Conjunctivitis,"Floaters!!!my floaters plus other eye issues are driveing me crazy,anyone else??","I'm late 5s,have had floaters since my 20s,back then they were small black or clear dots,fast forward,late fifties,now ive had pvds in both eyes,vitreous gel shrinks and pulls away from the back of the eye,now i have these clear to gauzey larger floaters,plus one large clumpy black one and I cant ignore them anymore. PVD is age related. I am just lucky enought to have these awful larger ones that can blur and obstruct vision. How does a person deal with it. Oh yes I also am starting to have dry eyes. Both also can caus hazy vision. Unless youve experienced it,no one else can relate! So frustrateing."
Conjunctivitis, Poor tear film quality,"Hi,i get blurry cloudy vision on and off,worse the last few weeks. Had complete eye exam,was tested for dry eye only useing the test where they see how fast drops evaporate. Dr said mild dry eye,so i asked why glare,window light looks cloudy at times etc,he just said probably poor tear quality. Frankly I dont think he did a very thourough job on checking for dry eyes. I do get some burning,feeling of grit in eyes at times etc. No catarcts. But it drives me nuts,im sure its the tear film as it looks like it. Any help here. Ive tryed scrubbing my eyelids,have tryed refresh eye drops,now trying vit A etc. Thank you."
Conjunctivitis,"My sight is good but I suffer while reading or watching a screen, what shud I do?",my eyes hurt and sometimes comes with a headache if I spend much time reading or watching a screen to a point that I can't see the written or the screen and I tried glasses but it doesn't work. Please I need a help. Thanks.
Conjunctivitis,Dry Eyes associated with reflux,"I wonder how many people with dry eyes also have reflux?A survey carried out in 2014 of 100 experiencing acid reflux found 34% also had dry eyes. This may be xplained by the passage of refluxate up the fill column of the oesophagus, breaching the upper oesophageal sphincter and aspirating into the nose and thence travelling as an irritant via the tear ducts.I'd be interested in how many with dry or gritty eyes have reflux and may not have considered the possibility the two were connected."
Conjunctivitis,what is this on my eye?, I've had this raised growth on my eye for years. Recently it feels like it has been pulsating or twitching. Does anyone know what it might be?
Conjunctivitis,Pink in vision,"I'm wondering if anyone has encountered anything similar. A couple of weeks ago I noticed that I was seeing pink in my version in certain environments. I mainly notice it at night when I look at white walls with the inside lights turned on, rather than in daylight, although I can still see it if I look for it. It's almost like an after-image when you've looked at a bright light, but there are lots of little pink splodges. I notice it more when I first walk into a room with the lights on, and it does kind of fade after a while.To be honest while it is noticeable it is fairly faint, so it's not like I have bright pink circles obscuring my vision or not. I guess I'm just more concerned about what is causing it rather than it negatively affecting my vision in any way.I've seen an eye doctor and been checked out fully, and everything seems fine. I have developed flu-like symptoms recently as well, which came on not long after I started noticing the vision issues. I have also been diagnosed in the past as being deficient in vitamin B12, and haven't had this checked again for over a year.Anyone have any idea, or have suffered from something similar? "
Conjunctivitis,Seeing a tiny black dot just recently ,At first I thought there was a gnat flying around me but turned out its what Im seeing. It looks like a gnat; a tiny black dot that flies in front of me or whichever my eyes are going. Is this something i need to be really concerned or alarmed about?
Conjunctivitis,Eye issues for 14 years - results of blocked tear ducts?,"Hi all, so this is my first time posting on forums like this, but i decided to try and get some help online as all the places i have been to have just made up various issues, or so it seems.I'm a 22 year old male, i was recently told i have Ulcerative Colitis (2 years ago nearly), and i've been struggling with my eyes for many years... When i was a child i apprently had blocked tear ducts and i believe that is still the case as i can't cry/let tears out.Ever since i was a child i've had eye issues, the earliest i remember having these issues was when i was in primary school, so we're looking at around 14 years, as i'm now 22 years old. When i was in primary school i was very active, i would always be out majority of the day, playing football or such, nowadays i'm more chilled and i'm pretty much always using a computer as it's my main hobby and my chosen job route.I feel like my eyes have been getting worse and worse as the years go on, and recently i've been getting servere headaches/pain, they seem to be getting worse and triggered instantly, no sign of them coming on. As far as i can tell it apeears to be related to my eyes.The issues my eyes are having/causing are;- My eyes have always been `droopy` i think is the name, i would sometimes even be accused of sleeping in class when i was a child due to it - Swelling / irritation, especially in the corners of the eye, constantly feel like there is something there and eye wash does nothing.When my eye swells/ is bad enough, it can even swell up so much so i can't see out of it, it takes 2-3 days for it to get better.- Vision is attrocious some days, much better other days...- Extremely dry, when i wake up my eyes often sting, and if my eyes are going to be bad, i can often tell from waking up, how dry they are.- Eye mucus - tearing/`crusty` skin around eye- Headaches as mentionedThing i have noticed about my eyes:- As an Ulcerative Colitis patient i have been given Prednisone a few times, during the times of being on the course i have felt like my eyes have been much much better with rarely any issues what soever, my Doctor thought maybe my colitis was causing my eye issues.- I have brought an eye `blanket` type of thing, i heat it up in the microwave and rest it on my eyes for 5-10 minutes, it really helps, but within 20 minutes my eyes are back to being bad, if the irritation of the eye starts, i can't stop it.As for meds, i have been given/tried tons of eye drops, my most recent meds are taking ""Celluvise 0.5%"" eye drops (replica tears?), on top of this i also take Steroid drops.I have been trying to deal with my eyes for the 14 years or so i've had the issues with them, but i haven't found any help as of yet, when i was a child i was told i had hayfever, I honestly don't think i do.I have been to Moorfields eye hospital many times and seen many people there, they would always do the same, ask what the issue is, say they're going to help, put in orange drips and look into my eye, then make up some weird name disease that i've never heard of and leave it at that. I have also been to Queens Hospital eye department, and they told me i do have issues with my eye and it's possible to have an operation to fix my droppy eyelids although this wasn't the cause for my eye issues apprently, but again, nothing has happened from that either.I have told both Moorfields and Queens about having blocked tear ducts when i was a child and ulcerative colitis, both of them assured me thay my issues are not caused by either blocked tear ducts or the colitis.I've pretty much given up getting my eyes sorted honestly, even though it has affected my life in a huge way and it will continue too, as when my eyes get extremely bad, i can't do anything but try and sleep it off, and at it's worst, it can take a few days...It was only recently that i decided to try and take it futher after everything, because i was talking with a mate and googled ""blocked tear ducts"" randomly, even though i was told this isn't the cause of my issues, everything i read, the symptons, i have EVERY single one of them.http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/blocked-tear-duct/symptoms-causes/dxc-20183598I have arranged an appointment with my local doctor but it'll take 2 weeks to get in there as usual, i made this thread because i'm bored of being `blagged` everytime i go to the `experts` for help. I heard moorfields are the best eye hospital around, and since i've been there atleast 5 times with nothing changing what soever, i've lost hope.Sorry for long post, probably poorly written too..."

Conjunctivitis,Intra-retinal Hemorrhages,"Has anyone here ever had these ""bleeds"". It's not as scary as it sounds, but every time it happeneds, I get a grayish area that stays, and ""blanks out"" my vision. Completely where it is, but they are tiny, so it's not that disruptive unless you are looking at something and then you shift your eyes and it disappears! I'm just wondering if they are permanent. I asked my doctor, but he gave kind of a vaque answer like, they could get better, and watch you blood pressure and blood sugar so you don't get more of them, etc.I also had a ""vein"" beed, which was much diferent. In that case, there was a constant blak dot in the middle of my vision. Afraid that it might have been macular degeneration (it happened overnight, woke up with it), I immediately called the eye doctor, an when he saw me, they took pictures, etc., he said it was a retinal hemorrhage, but not associated with my retinopathy, as were the intra-retinal ones. That spot has almost completely gone away after 6 months, but since it wasn't like the other ones, I am wondering if the other ones will ever go away. I've had them about 3 years, and there is no change, good or bad, in them.Help?!"
Conjunctivitis,random redness in eyes?,"Hi all,5 months ago my eyes became totally bloodshot. This lasted for around 10 days and the redness went down however my eyes now have pinkish veins in the white part. almost like squiggly lines. However occasionally there are times were both of my eyes will flare up and the pinkish veins will turn red in colour and i will also get little red blotches in other places usually near the centre of my eyes (almost touching the coloured part) on a day to day basis there is no pain and hardly any discomfort (the way my eyes were before) there is still no discomfort even when I get these flare ups, I wouldn't know if i didn't look in the mirror. The appearance however is really knocking me socially and emotionally. My gp just says its dry eyes, the optician said I have blepharitis which just does not fit with the symptoms. Can anyone help and give me some indication on what you think this is?If anything there seems to be slightly more mucus in/around my eye but nothing over the top. please help "
Conjunctivitis,Weird Vision for 7 months?,For the last 7 months I've been having weird vision. I see:-White moving specks 24/7 when i look up in the sky-After images-Black lines almost looks like the veins inside my eyes. (This only shows when I exercise) This symptom freaks me out the MOST So I have no idea whats wrong with me. Been to an eye doctor (clear)I've even had a brain MRI (clear)So I don't know if this is normal. If I have a vitamin deficiency.Anyone knows what it could be or has experienced something like this it would be great to hear from you. Should I be worried?
Conjunctivitis,Getting Tired of This!!,"Hey guys! I'm really scared, and frankly, this really hurts. A week ago, I didn't have any sleep that night at all, and went to church, anyway. After church service was over, my vision got odd and I began to have a panic attack. Right now, it's happening again.Yesterday, I woke up really early (6pm), and I had a masive migraine. I had nausea, my vision was awful (not like it is right now), my head was pounding, and my neck hurt, as well. I couldn't even eat my dinner, and had to rest until 9pm to eat.My migraine seemed to last pretty OK after I rested, for the most part, but my head still hurt. I keep getting this ringing sound in my ears. Half the time when that happens, I get headache, especially around the ear that's ringing. I was getting that ringing sound before I got a bad migraine, like right now.I'm having trouble walking, reading any videos or reading, and I definitely can't listen to any noises that are even a little bit of noise. I keep getting floaters in my eyes and things are getting blurry. I feel like I might go blind, or die. It's getting me scared.My whole head is hurting, espically around my left eye, the back of my head, and my neck. I'm just really freaking out, and would like to help me. I'm seeing these sort of spots that are destorted. They look kinda like I'm looking at a bubble, and sometimes I look like I'm under water.Much thanks would be appreciated. "
Conjunctivitis,Am I worried about nothing?,"Hello! :D I am posting this to see if anyone can offer me some advice, as I am a bit of a hypochrondriac, and occasionally need a kick up the backside to stop myself diagnosing myself with anything and everything. Now, before I begin, I will admit that recently I have been suffering with anxiety, so the issue I am about to tell you about may potentially be caused by this. Anyway, the issue is this...Whenever I look at things, no matter what it is, I feel like I can see a faint circle of light, and it looks like it's aligned with where my pupil would be. I don't have sore head, or any pain whatsoever in either eye, it's more annoying than anything else. I'm not sure if it's a ""floater"" because it seems to remain in the same place, whereas I thought floaters kinda moved around.Any ideas?"
Conjunctivitis,Corneal Abrasion - how best to heal?,"I was given an unexpected gift in my opthalmologist's office - a long scratch on my cornea during the process of my doc's assistant trying contact lens on me. Since I had local anasthesia I did not realize this happened till I felt some discomfort and my doc came in, looked and saw the scratch (corneal abrasion) over my pupil. He said I would be hurting quite a bit when the eye drops wore off and gave me a clear bandaid on the cornea for 2 days to help it heal. 3 days out it's better but still scratchy, the ""bandaid"" was taken off yesterday but my vision is still blurry. This is on the same eye where I had cataract surgery 7 weeks earlier and I have been in the process of getting 2nd opinions since I got stuck with the wrong IOL lens. (I also posted in the cataract forum last month) My question is, is there a general time frame wherein the blurriness goes away? How to prevent what I read about re repeat occurences? Do I need to delay getting my 2nd opinions on cataract re-surgery till this is back to normal? (hoping it WILL be back to normal of course!)"

Conjunctivitis,Macular hole recovery ,"I had a macular hole and had a victorectomy 2 weeks ago for this. I had a short acting gas put in and postered face down.

Conjunctivitis,Macular hole operation,"I have just had a macular hole operation. I didn't have the gas in my eye, but had oil instead. Had the oil removed 4 days ago and my vision is awful. Hopefully it will improve dramatically in the near future. I have had two ops. One with gas and the second with oil. If you have the choice, go for the gas. Inconvenience of posturing is much better than having an extra op. To remove the oil. "
Conjunctivitis,I've been having a dizzy sensation in my head for a few weeks now,"For the last 3 weeks or so I've felt as if I've had dizziness/wooziness in my head. It haven't been feeling dizzy in my vision although when I turn my head it is pretty much a blur until I stop, almost as if my brain can't keep up with my eyes. My eye sight as a whole is great but this is really bugging me recently. Would anyone recommend I get an eye test or would it be more worth while to just see a doctor?"
Conjunctivitis,Blurry vision on right eye after being hit by toy dart gun,"My brother and I were playing games with our toy dart guns (not Nerfs, just cheap dart guns) when unexpectedly (the Stormtrooper that he is), he shot a clean dart to my right eye at about a meter or so distance. I ended up yelping in pain as my right eye flooded with tears. A few hours later, the pain had gone away, but sometimes it would come back. I noticed that my right eyesight has decreased, and whenever I close my left eye and only let my right eye open, I am barely able to make out words, and light is scattered almost everywhere. I haven't visited the eye doctor yet. is it necessary? Will I be okay?"
Conjunctivitis,No brand of contacts have been comfortable,"I have worn contacts for over 20 years with little to on problems. The only contacts I have ever used were the Bausch and Lomb SoftToric 66 for Astigmatism. I am 38 years old now, and now I can't wear them anymore due to discomfort. I'm very active and want to continue to wear contacts. I have tried Acuvue Oasys and Biofinity and both came back uncomfortable. Any help what to do?!?! I'm now wearing glasses and they are a pain in the neck. I have a LASIK appointment soon, but I don't know if I want to do that...I just want to wear contacts and have them comfortable. Please advise. Will be trying DAILIES soon, and my fingers are crossed for them to work! "
Conjunctivitis,bad peripheral vision,HiWent for an eye test today and after I had a peripheral vision test. My right eye was fine however my left eye was really bad.

Conjunctivitis,Left eye feels very dry and bothers me. Had it like that for I guess 2 years. What can I do? ,Me left eye feels dry and bothers me. Both eyes are sometimes red but this happenes since I am a kid. But on the left eye I feel like I need to put saliva on it to ease the feeling.

Conjunctivitis,Lasik eye treatment wasn't the Wow Factor,"About 7 years ago I had the lasik revolutionary eye treatment up in London. Beforehand, I went through all the preliminaries and was considered a good candidate. I was long-sighted with astigamatism in left eye. Initially it was wonderful, but over time I found I had to get reading and driving glasses again. Last diagnosis at eye doctor was early cataracts (runs in family)I don't think I want to fool around with my eyesight again, but was extremely disappointed with the high cost of this procedure and then ending up with glasses again. People have told me that it works infinitely better with near sighted people. Did anyone else experience this problem?"

Conjunctivitis,No relief for dry eyes,So I'm making an appointment for the eye doctor again and I followed his advice and more. I'm going to list the things I tried. I've had this for months. I'm thinking it could be a side effect from the celexa I'm on. I have tried:Hot compressMultiple eye dropsPreservative free eye dropsStore brand PM ointmentBought a humidifierCleaned eyelidsTaking frequent breaks from computerI have no problem forming tears for crying which I have done a few time you know since its great having the feeling of dry air hitting your eyelids 24/7 and the only relief is sleeping.Other pills I take is elmiron for bladder. The only thing I can literally think is my medicine. I'm trying to get off it but it's super hard. I'm on half of a half but you still get those symptoms of dizzyness etc. What can I do to feel any sort of relief?? If anyone requires additional personal info just ask please. T_T
Conjunctivitis,visible blood vessels in white of eye for MONTHS?,Hi I am really in need of help.I am 21 years old and 3 months ago I woke up and noticed both of my eyes were extremely bloodshot. This lasted for about 5 days then the redness went down slightly but however 3 months on there is still visible redness in both of my eyes. Also every now and again (not very often though) I get little red mark/spots that become very visible on the white's of my eye for like 20 mins but then goes.. so it's clear something is irritating it surely? It doesent hurt or sting the only difference I see is when i wake up in the morning my eye mucus is now watery and stringy rather than it used to being dry and crumbly. Other than that I can't really say anything is different but it's been 3 months and it's driving me crazy it's affecting my self esteem a lot!I have been to my gp who just don't help! I really want to see a ompthalogist but I can't get the referral. I have been to the opticians aswell and neither seem to be that bothered but it really is fustrating me. What could this be?

Conjunctivitis,I'm Worried - am I losing my vision or what??,simple cataract surgery... MD placed the lens in the anterior chamber ( I think too much blood to see clealy)...hyphema occurred and vision continues to be blurry after 9 months. I'm not sure what is going on and stressing. I'm on 4 drops a day and have blurry vision for distance and even with reading glasses. Is this normal and can it get worse from a hyphema. The Optical Disc increased from .4 to .65. A cornea specialist lasered thought the sac because he said it was flattened and blocking my sight. This helped some but still blurry(opaque). Another concern is that the first surgeon put a lens designed for the posterior chamber into the anterior chamber. Is this common practice and OK? Any help or thoughts are appreciated. Thanks

Conjunctivitis,Why does my vision shake whilst looking closely at things?,"For as long as I can remember, whenever looking at things closely (say aboutIn inch from my face) my vision slightly shakes from left to right. It doesn't actually affect how I see things, it's just annoying. It seems to be worse in my right eye, when I'm tired and when reading mainly black ink on White paper. I'm 23 and had my eyes checked about a year ago which was all fine apart from having a slight astigmitism which has gotten better. What is this condition? I read somewhere it's to do with my brain trying to hold both the eye images together or something.... Is it common and should I worry ? Thank you"
Conjunctivitis,eye redness has knocked my confidence down so much that i rarely leave the house,"This started around the end of october 2015. I woke up one morning to see both of my eyes completely bloodshot. This looked really bad for 2 weeks then the redness went down slightly and has not cleared up completely 3 months on. No pain whatsoever. Only difference I see is that my eyes water a little and sometimes randomly it flares up and more redness comes into the eye for a hour or so. But on a normal day there are just a few red veins in the whites of my eye that don't seem to go at all. I am suffering so much because of this, I can't give eye contact to anyone because I feel so insecure. I saw a doctor in the first week of this happening and he prescribed me optrex eyedrops for conjucitvits. But how can it be conjunctivis if it has lasted this long? I went to a optician who told me he thinks i have slight blepharitis.(My eyelids are fine though) he give me a hot compress which I used for a week but found it was making the redness more visible. I really need some help, i went to the doctors last week he done a swab test and I am waiting for results. He won't refer me to a ompthalogist. Has anyone experienced anything similar? And if so did the redness in the eyes go?"
Conjunctivitis,"Right upper eye lid swollen since over 2 years ago, nothing helped yet.","Hello, as you can see in the picture I attached, my right upper eye lid is swollen since around 2 years.I noticed it on christmas 2014.It might've been swollen since way before that.I've been to several eye doctors.Some told me, I should accept my appearance, some told me there's nothing wrong with it, others told me it's a very mild disease and gave me eye drops which did nothing in the end.My eye lid doesn't hurt all the time, but there are times when it hurts.Sometimes it gets teary, and I feel, that in general my eyesight on that eye seems a bit worse than on my left eye.And of course, my field of view is a bit limited, simply because that eye lid is lower than the other.I really would like it, if my eye lid cures, but no matter to which doctor I go, no one helps me in the end : /I hope anyone here can give me advice.ThanksMax"
Conjunctivitis,Astigmatism - dizzyness ?,"Hello,my name is Chris and I am new her to this forum.?I hope to get some good advice or some info exchange from people with similar issues.I have issues with my glasses since I got diagnosed with astigmatism.I wear glasses for 32 years - 27 years of that time I lived in Germany and I never got diagnosed with astigmatism and never, ever had any issues with my glasses. I could exchange different pairs and would adjust within minutes or even seconds.Now I live in Canada and got diagnosed with astigmatism ...I have 4 pairs of glasses (same prescription) and when I go from my standard glasses to sunglasses, it takes hours to adjust ... and still feels weird.Getting dizzy from time to time, too ...My eye-doctor says, everything is okay and the prescription is correct.?I went to different doctors already ... and had even weirder prescriptions.I kinda doubt, that I have astigmatism and my glasses try to adjust something, that is not there - just guessing.Can someone give me some good advice please?ThanksChris "
Conjunctivitis,"Vitreious detachment, and superior temporal flame hemorrhage, and cloud floater.","I had a Vitreious detachment about 5 months ago. The Retinal specialists did about 10 minutes of laser treatment to seal around the minor tear. Initially, and for several weeks, i had many flashes on the right side of my right eye. And, i had floaters the size of fly (looked like i was seeing a stationary fly). The flashes have pretty much gone away, as have the fly floaters. However, i have this (what i call) cloud or jellyfish shaped semi-clear floater. When i move my eye to the right, the cloud moves to the left. When i move my eye to the left, the cloud moves to the right. It constantly gets in the way of my vision. Has anyone experienced anything like this cloud?"

Conjunctivitis,Eye still blurry after eye exam,"Hello, my daughter went to the eye doctor like she does every year for a full exam with dialation, ect. Afterward, her left eye cleared up but the right eye is still blurry weeks later. She went back to the doctor who couldn't find anything wrong. She followed up with a specialist who gave a very thorough exam and still could not find anything. Is this common? She never had this problem before and does wear contact lens."
Conjunctivitis,Ghosting/double vision in one eye,"About 3 months ago I felt my right eye became a bit weaker and uncomfortable, and also ghostling double vision with the right eye only after sitting on the computer too long, which is the main issue that bothers me. I thought it maybe dryness, but eye drops didn't help, the ghosting vision resolves within about 10 mins after getting off the computer. It can happen anytime and has nothing to do with sleep.I've always wore glasses, both eyes were -2.5. I've seen a doctor and made tests, she said nothing is wrong with the right eye and it's just like the left eye. She said it's -3, but couldn't provide any explanation for the ghosting double vision in the right eye.I should note that the symptoms appeared around the same time an upper right-side maxillary tooth was swollen, and caused a very small bump to appear under my eye which still exists 3 months on, I've taken care of the tooth since, but that was 3 months ago and the eye issues have not resolved.Any ideas what it might be?"
Conjunctivitis,"Possible double vision(diplopia), what do I do?","Hi,I am 14 years of age. For as long as I can remember, I have seen what appear to be ""ghost images"". I have looked up pictures of ghost images, and they do appear to be what I see. I haven't told anyone about this. I go to an eye doctor every few months, who hasn't diagnosed it yet, so it is possible that everyone sees this, but I highly doubt it. I have also suffered from this for a long time, so should I hope that it turns out to be nothing, or talk to my doctor? For any future reference, it does not get any better or worse at the edges. I do not normally tilt my head to the side. If I cover one eye, it goes away. I can control it at will, but if I relax, it comes back. Please tell me if this is normal, or if I should talk to my eye doctor."
Conjunctivitis,Blurred vision at distance,"I don't know if this is a real eye issue or not but I need someones advice.So basically I got my drivers license a few months ago and a few days ago when I went driving with my supervisor, I had a bit of trouble seeing the speed limit number on the sign. The sign displayed 60/km but it looked like 80km/h, I am unsure what the exact speed limit was at that time, it could have been 80km/h to 60km/h or vice versa. I did see the correct number once I got closer. BTW I was travelling to the sign at 90km/h. Also, when I used to watch news on my TV whilst sitting on the couch I could read like the title of the story/topic down the bottom and the smaller words down the bottom and the time in the corner, well now I can't. It's blurry but once I get closer I can see it very well. I want to get my eyes tested but I'm scared the Optometrist might deem me ""unsafe"" to drive thus losing my license and not being allowed to drive. That'll literally destroy my life to crumbs. I forgot to mention that I'm 18 years old and male. I did pass the eye sight test at my local motor registry. "
Conjunctivitis,Can someone here pls kindly share me simple and natural tips to control blepharitis?,"I feel really down and I hope someone can kindly answer me. Even having moderate myopia, but before starting blepharitis, I lived in a nice life with all day make up and contact lenses, use iPad, iPhone and drinking much coffee as I want. But, this year, I rarely wear them. First, I only have eye strain. I visited doctor. I don't know why I have eyelid inflamed. I visited doctor 2imes already (once a week). I used his eyedrops for 2weeks(opticorn n maxitrol). It just better and never clear up. So, I stop use them now. He never mentioned what kind of blepharitis do I have, he said my eye balls are ok. He don't even tell me about self care. My blepharitis started 5weeks now. I do hot compress and lid scrab 1-2times/days. I sometimes, use coconut oil, I often can see blood vessels surrounding my iris edge as well as on sclera, some mucus also come out from my eyes few times per day. I feel unwell like gritting and dry as well as after wake up. I difficult dealing with it, So these few days I feel little better by using New V.Rohto eyedrops. Now even my skin seem not well. I'm having dandurff, dry skin, itch skin often, even my face is also itch and often have red poins appear, but sometimes, it gone. I drink Royal-D in the morning and omega 3 before bedtime. I really sick of this cos Don know when will it clear up. How long will it get under control and how long I can back to contact lense again.I feel really down now since I gain lot of weight and skin lines cos of my pregnancy, having moderate myopia that not yet stable, n high IOP (20, 19). now I cannot use any make up and contact lense even on party, I want to do reflective surgery in the future. But, I search through online and can see that blepharitis is complicated and can cause a lot of eyes problems such as dry eyes, abnormal blood vessels growth in the corneal, corneal ulcer, conjuntiva problems and else. I want to let my life go cos of this very often, but I can't cos I need to find a job some months later for my daughters' future. Now I feel I dying alive. How sad. :'("

Conjunctivitis,Anesthesia and Psoriasis Eye Questions,"According to two ophthalmologists, I have small bumps underneath my left lower eyelid. One opthalmologist thinks its related to my psoriasis. The bumps dont hurt and so far, it is not effecting my eye sight. However, it is slightly infected. The antibiotics took away the infection but I still have the bumps. I am very concerned because I am undergoing a myomectomy soon and need my eyes to be 100% in good health for the anesthesia. According to the anesthesiologist, if infection still persists, I may wake up blind. SO I have a couple of questions:1. Can psoriasis form underneath the eyelid?2. Will I wake up blind from these bumps? 3. Is a steroid necessary? (the ophthamologist that thinks its psoriasis, doesn't want to put me on a steroid because of the potential increase of intra-ocular pressure. The myomectomy will be cancelled if my pressure is elevated)4. What else can be potentially causing these bumps?"

Conjunctivitis,Eye injury,"Hi. I'm a bit worried about something and just looking for reassurance.I was playing around with a blue laser in a dark room last thursday and think it may have damaged my eye. I don't think it's anything permanent but I'm still scared and I'm not sure what I should be expecting, so I've got a few questions.Bit of info first...It is labelled class iii 1mw 405nm, but I now understand a lot of these things are mislabelled, and are often more powerful, which is one of my concerns. I was wearing ski glasses at the time which protect in the 400nm range.I was being careful not to look directly at the beam, but I think it reflected off a chrome surface and shone across my vision. It was playing with it for about 5 min in total, but stopped as soon as that happened.My left eye became slightly irritated after a few mins and was tingling like I'd just washed my face with mint showergel. It was only the bottom left eyelid though really, not the actual eye-ball, which is strange and something I don't understand.I was worried but the pain wasn't bad enough to stop me sleeping or anything, infact it really helped. I woke up feeling fine, but after 30min or so, the same part of the eye was tingling again, so I managed to get a doctors appointment for the same day (last friday).Doc pressed around area and asked if it was sore, which it was not. He then dropped some green dye onto eye to inspect it, and he said he couldn't see any signs of damage. Don't think he checked retina or lens and just said come back if vision gets worse.The tingling faded over the next few days, but now I just have the feeling something isn't quite right and I can't put my finger on it. I've not noticed any dark spots or anything, but I seem to be able to focus further using the other eye. And I feel a bit more sensitive to bright lights now.Is this something which will improve over time?I feel like I have less energy since then as well, which is odd, but might just because I'm worrying.If there is a possibilty I could have permanently damaged my eyes in anyway, would I ""know about it"" instantly or does this take weeks/months to notice? And can you explain what these injuries could be.Please help. What steps should I take?I love my eyes and vision and feel like a fool.Thanks in advanceDan"

Conjunctivitis,Planning future in the UK with Wet MD,"Hi all, I hope there is someone here who can help me or give me guidance on where to find out the information I need. I am in my early 50's and got diagnosed with Wet MD in July this year. I had 3x4 weekly Eylea injections to which, I had a brilliant response. The 4th injection was stretched to 8 weeks but I deteriorated badly in the 6th week so am back to 4 weekly injections again and have had a laser treatment, which they are hoping will slow the growth of the capillaries. I respond well to the injections, but my consultant says that What I have is severe and aggressive as soon as the injection wears off.So......my predicament......I live in Australia. I was born in the UK, lived there most of my life and moved out here 10yrs ago at my partner's request. We have since parted and all my friends and family are in the UK. Prior to the diagnosis of Wet MD, I had intended to return to live in the UK within the next 10 years. I had also considered moving to Spain and working in Gibraltar perhaps even sooner if I was able to get work. I'm a Registered Nurse.My injections are covered by my private health insurance in Australia. I wouldn't be able to get cover in the UK now for a pre existing condition.......so, would I be covered under the NHS? Or how could I get the injections?"

Conjunctivitis,Please help ( advice needed for my daughters eye problems ) ,My daughter is 11 now. She has had problems with her eyes since approx 6 months old. I will try my best to explain what she does and what help we have had so far . I first took my daughter to the doctors when she was 6 month old as every time I took her out in her pram she would scream and screw up her eyes I soon realised that the problem was daylight / sunlight . The doctor referred her for tests . They sent her to Manchester hospital where thet put her under anasphetic to examine her eyes . ( no result found ) I asked for second opinion and was referee to Liverpool holiday for the same procedure . ( again no result ) they said maybe as she grows this problem will resolve but this is not the case it has got worse . She now walks around with her right eye almost shut if it's bright / windy sometimes she can be just sat at the dining table ea ring and she will drop her head and be squinting and struggling to see . We ask her if she is in pain or is something wrong and she doesn't know how to describe the problem . We have no photos of her looking direct at a camera or with her eyes wide open . I really don't know what to do next . She starts high school in September and I'm worried she will be bullied . But aside from that I KNOW there is something wrong but how can I convince the doctors and specialists .
Conjunctivitis,Part of eye red for 2-3 months?,"My right eye has been red with veins for 2-3 months. However it is only red on the right side of the eye and does not hurt but itches a tiny tiny bit, could be me just thinking about it. Should I go visit a doctor or maybe leave it alone? I do not feel very uncomfortable with it, but maybe I should be worried?"
Conjunctivitis,I`m having this blood colour thing in my eye for about two days now,"I would like to know, what it is and the solution."
Conjunctivitis,Macular pucker/epiretinal membrane,"I've had this for about five years now and it affects the vision in my right eye - straight lines are wavy, etc. The worst thing is the double vision I get, as the image I get from each eye is different. I've still to find anybody who has, or has had, this and would really like to compare notes with somebody about it."
Conjunctivitis,Eye patch or no Eye patch," Ok heres the deal, I have had a cateract in my left eye for several years now. In the past year one day my left eye kind of went poof all of the sudden and pretty must lost all visability in it. Can see some light still, but it's pretty much gone. Now I'm low income pretty much and have no insurance, so surgery is out of the question at this time. Now a friend said something to me the other day that kinda makes sense to me and would like some other opinions. What he said to me, is that because my left eye can still see some light, it struggles my good eye in a way that it could cause problems and I would be better off putting a patch over my left eye to black it out so my right eye can properly compisate for the left one. Does this make any sense to anybody here????"
Conjunctivitis,What could this brown spot be?,"Hello,A few months ago, I noticed an irregularity around a small part of my right eye's iris. I am starting to worry because it seems to have spread from a small line to what appears a light brown spot.

Conjunctivitis,Bleeding in my eye for no apparent cause?,"I woke up the other day with blurriness in my left eye. I went to the eye doctor and he said I have blood in my left eye, saying it was retinal hemmorhaging. He said there was no retinal holes or tears, but he did not know what was causing the bleeding. He has referred me to another specialist at the Vanderbelt Eye Institute for a second opinion. Has anyone else ever had anything similar to this? I am not a diabetic and do not have high blood pressure and thought I was somewhat healthy?"

Conjunctivitis,Doc says I can't drive,"i am 30 years old, and for the last 5 years my visions as been getting worse and worse. The doc used to be able to correct me to 20/20 but now I can only be corrected to 20/100. I have been having a lot of trouble driving, running red lights, almost getting into accidents, having trouble focusing my eyes at work. I notice it's much worse when it's bright out. I have an astigmatism in both eyes and have for a while. Recently, I went to the optometrist and she couldn't figure out why I can't see. Now I have to go to a specialist. Until they can figure out what's going on, I can't drive. I am clueless as to what is going on, but otherwise I am healthy. Every once in a while I get pain behind my eye, and sometimes I get headaches. Last heeadache I had kept me out of work for 4 days. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I also am told I keep things way too close to my face when reading. "
Conjunctivitis,Retina occlusions both eyes (hubby),"Hubby has CVRO in right eye so virtually no central vision. For many years, he has been receiving injections for the VRO in right eye. We are on the third eye med injection RX and it has quit working, inflammation was much worse for the Sept visit. The latest switch was to Eyelea (3 so far) and we will have consultation to determine whether we should go back to Lucentis. His glaucoma was at 9/11 this last visit to opthamologist and near that at retina specialist. Wondering if there are others out there taking any kind of supplements such as Vitamin C or/and Fish (Krill) oil to maintain glaucoma levels. Just seems there should be a way for that blamed inflammation to dissipate but it is trapped it seems. Stay hopeful for hubby but he is pretty much virtually blind at this juncture."
Conjunctivitis,White glassed eye shows up in Polaroid picture,"HelloYesterday I had a polaroid picture taken of me.

Conjunctivitis,"Going blind, I think...","I have been losing my vision for about a year now. I can still ""see"" right now, but I think it's fading day by day.My symptoms are:- A dark veil that covers part of my vision when I look at something with one eye. It takes a second for the dark veil to appear. I have to stare at something for a second for it to happen.- When I'm looking out of one eye, staring at something, I notice that I have a couple blind spots where I can't see anything.- I have a veil of sparkly tiny light covering most of my vision, whether my eyes are open or closed.- When I first wake up, my vision seems to ""flicker"" on and off.- The white part of my eye is always beat red. It goes away during the day somewhat, but at night it gets really bad. I usually have to wake up at 3 in the morning and put in eye drops.- Lots of black floaters.- If I look at a bright light, I'll see it for the next 5 to 10 minutes.-Awful night vision.- I have this like weird transparent, moving sun thing in the center of my vision. Not sure how to describe it really.So, I think I'm in the process of going blind. I believe it has something to do with taking the hair loss drug, propecia. I think it may have messed up my hormones or something. I know hormones impact sight.There seems to be very little information on the internet about what to do if you're losing your vision. I have been to several opthamoligists and they all say my eyes look fine, which I find disconcerting. Not really sure how I can be going blind, but they say my eyes look totally normal. Either they're bad opthamologists or something strange is going on in my body.Has anyone on here had similar symptoms to me? If so, was there anything that you did to prevent yourself from going blind? I live in the US. Is there a cutting edge doctor I could see about this?"
Conjunctivitis,Massive Butterfly size floaters.,"hi folks. wonder if anyone could throw some light on my experience. this evening, i suddenly experienced butterfly size floaters in my peripheral vision. they came & went intermittantly, no other associated symptoms apart from a headache. i phoned 111 & was advised to see a Doc within 2 hrs. the Walk In centre didn't have a Doc so had to go to A & E. they said there was nothing 'worrying' they could see - no pun on words there. i was too embarrased to ask. anybody idea what they might be?

Conjunctivitis,"Blurred vision, but eye doctor said eyes are perfect!!!","Hi there,I was hoping someone might help me. I have having blurred vision for the last while, I went to the optician and he said all was perfect that he would refer me to specialist. The specialist also cannot find cause, that I am scoring perfect in every test she done. I also had an MRI brain and that was clear also. I got tested for Lymes disease but that blood test came back clear too. I have been having sensory problems too on my thigh, face and arm. I am not weak with it just the skin feels funny.The consultant in the hospital said that she doesnt think its MS ,which was one of the reasons the GP referred me in to the hospital.2 weeks later I am none the wiser.I would very much appreciate anyones views on this.Kindest regardsAisling"
Conjunctivitis,Conjunctivitis And What To Do?,"Hi guys,For the past full week, I think I've been suffering from conjunctivitis. I was wondering how I can determine what type I have and if there's anything I can do/purchase for it.- I had a feeling as if something was in my left eye for a couple of days, but this has finally gone! - Both my left and right eyes seem to be a little tender and watery. They are a tiny bit sensetive to light but not by much at all. They are generally white but both with some blood shot areas.- I have experienced no pain or loss of vision (Fingers Crossed!). I also have cold like symptoms such as a runny nose, varying temperture, watery eyes. But, I would say these are mild to minor. I've seen a small improvement since I got it a week a go and it's defintley got a tiny bit better. Should I give it another week before I see a doctor because it says to give it about two weeks to go away? Is it worth buying some eye drops from the pharmacist? And, what kind of conjunctivitis do I have?Thanks so much for you're help! Cheers."

Conjunctivitis,"Help, blurry eye problem. Happened over night.",Has anyone ever woken up with blurry vision? I wear contacts/glasses. I woke up and rushed to work (put contacts in) and all morning my eyes were burning and blurry with the contacts in. It got worse when the sun came up. I could barely keep my eyes open.

Conjunctivitis,developed estropia?,"I'm 25,nearsighted and also astigmatic.About two years ago my left eye suddenly started getting smaller and turning in. I went to a lot of doctors but they insisted that it must be like that since birth. A few days ago my right eye started twitching and since then there's a constant pressure around it,like i'm straining it. I also noticed now that my right eye is turning in too, only it hasn't been that noticable until now.

Conjunctivitis,Photodynamic Therapy Visudine,HI EveryoneJust wondering has anyone ever had PDT?I am only 36 and been diagnosed with a choroidal hemangioma.about 6 years ago. Now it is leaking fluid. They want to do PDT treatment only has a 50% chance and a heaps of side effects that will really screw up my life.I do not beleive in drugs and have tried natural remedies hoping this thing will disappear.But no such luck. Although they said it had shunk a bit.My main concern is this drug has only been licenced in Australia for only 15 years and the clientel is usually old fokes aged over 70. I have a feeling i will end up wih liver or kidney issues such as cancer as i used to drink heaps of alcohol. I don;t particulary wish to suffer i would prefer to die and be done with it.My Intuition tells me a loud n clear no. I do not trust this doctor at all.But everyone keeps telling me he is the best in Aus and i should just go along with whatever.
Conjunctivitis,Help/Advice About My Eyes.,"Hi guys,?For the last 3-4 days, I've been having some problems with my eyes. I don't think it's anything to serious, but I was wondering if anyone knew something I could do or try to help it.?So, basically my eyes have all of a sudden got pretty dry. It varies during the day how it is, for instance, in the afternoon it feels like it's almost gone, and in the evening it's back again.?My eyes feel fairly heavy and I seem to be squinting a little. At first, they were watering a bit, but this has stopped completely. It seems to be the outside part of the eye on the skin which is the problem? It seems a litle red. There is no pain, it just feels dry. I also find looking at the computer doesnt do it any favours. However, my eye sight and such has remained the same but as I say, my eye feels heavy and dry and a tad annoying at times. I'll attach a picture of what it's like. (I found the picture on Google so it's not me, but looks a bit like what I have.) "
Conjunctivitis,Wondering if anyone can help.,"As far back as I can remember, I've been zoning out from time to time, it's very intense and I can't seem to snap out of it for a few minutes at least. My parent's were never very observant and didn't care too much about my health so they never noticed it but it has been happening much more frequently these days, Anyways. When I met my girlfriend last year she started noticing that my left eye was going off to the side severely when i'd have these episode's. I have noticed my vision becoming worse the last year as well. It's hard to focus on thing's especially when they're far away and She's also noticed my eye doing it when I wake up in the morning. I've not been to the eye doctor yet because I'm very good at just putting thing's off to the side for as long as I can but I'm very curious about it. A few weeks ago while we were on Skype, I actually got to see it for myself due to the lag in video. I'd just opened my eyes and it went off to the left side and up. It startled me quite a bit. So if anyone has any thought's or advice for me. It'd be greatly appreciated. Thank you."
Conjunctivitis,Floaters after getting hit with a soccer ball? Help!,"Last Wednesday I got hit with a soccer ball in the eye very hard from probably 2 feet in front of me. All I could see was grey, nothing else in that eye. I went to the ER where they diagnosed me of a hyphema. They then put me on drops to dilate and bring down my in-ocular eye pressure. It's been 3 days since then and I almost have my vision back with a little bit of blurriness. And the only thing that is concerning me now is the floaters.1. Will they go away? Or will I ""Get used to them?""2. Can they go away completely?3. Will the blurriness go away?I'm 16. "
Conjunctivitis,dry eyes,"I just had my eyes examined and new glasses picked out and ordered. I used eye artifial tears, but my eyes are atill very dry. Not only that but my forehead throbs. Surley it's is just sinuses . Surely it's more than that.Could be the start of a sty?

I have alot of health issues and I hope you don't think that I am making all my discussions up.

Conjunctivitis,Blurryness in my left eye disappears when I squint,"For the last two weeks my left eye has been blurry. I don't remember hitting it or scratching it. Sometimes a do rub my eyes but nothing has come of it before. In the last two weeks I've noticed the blurry vision for objects mostly far away. My 20/20 vision is now a lot worse when I close my right eye. There has been no pain or itchiness either. Today in class the blurryness was bothering me quite a bit, so I started playing around with the skin around my eye moving it left and right. I noticed if I moved it the right way(closer to my nose) my vision would clear up. Then I tried squinting hard with both eyes(right is closed, left is slightly open) and my vision was clear. I can't find anything similar on the web so I came here for advice."

Conjunctivitis,Is my new prescription correct?,"Hey all,I recently went to a new eye specialist for a new prescription and upon returning home and comparing my new prescription to my previous one (3 years older,)I noticed that they varied quite a bit. Is the new prescription valid? since the new optician took the reading at 90deg, does it justify the drastic difference in spherical readings? Thanks for your help!Old Prescription (Optometrist):Right Eye:- SPH (-3.75), CYL (+1.25), AXIS (180)Left Eye:- SPH (-4.00), CYL (+1.25), AXIS (175) New Prescription (ophthalmologist):Right Eye:- SPH (-2.50), CYL (-1.50), AXIS (90)Left Eye:- SPH (-3.25), CYL (-1.50), AXIS (90)"
Conjunctivitis,I'm confused. No professional were able to answer my question,I first discovered that I have eye defect in 2005. Anytin after 2hrs. My eye will be blurred and headache will setin . I hsv visited many optician both public and private. They only recommended glass without cause except the last one here in akwa ibom who said I have hyperopic which to my knowledge is not the same symptom. He ask me to read from afar and near. I can do both successfully. He recommended glass. Telling me my eye is over functioning beyond normal. I can't see again without glass but it was not so before I go to hospital. Glass worse the case. I dont want glass. I want medicine. I am limited to many tons. Right now I have stop it a week ago though it is not easy but I can read where much light is. What will u say sir
Conjunctivitis,recurrent corneal erosion syndrome,I had this condition un-diagnosed for many years its frequency has increased from once a year to twice a month or so. Eye drops such as chloramphenicol and chloromycetin make it worse. Chloramphencol ointment Chloromycetin ointment and Simple eye ointment seem to be the only treatment that works. I have to sleep on my back to avoid my eye burying into the pillow if I sleep on my side. To ensure I wake up and have no problem I have to apply a blob of chloromycetin and a line of simple eye ointment into both eyes at bedtime.I don't really know where to go from here. Any successes out there?
Conjunctivitis,What can the optician actually see during an examination?,"I know your eyes, before somebody comments that lol...Basically, I had an eye exam last week, I explained to the optician that now and again, but rare, I see a small dot or very small blob of light, sometimes white, sometimes blue. It's very quick, it flashes almost, and also how if I'm watching TV and look away, I continue to see the light from the screen when I close my eyes. I had an examination in both eyes, which took about 20 minutes. At the end, he failed to mention the light I see on occassion, but just told me I am short sighted, with one eye worse than the other. I'm wondering if he would have spotted a problem if there were one there? As he failed to put my mind at ease by not mentioning it, I'm wondering if that is technically a good thing, or should I see a different optician? I know it's probably nothing serious, but I would have liked to hear him say that, rather than tell me what I already know. The only information I have is that I am slightly short sighted, with my left eye being the weakest. I stare at a computer screen a lot for work and in leisure time, but that's about it. Anybody ever had a similar experience?"
Conjunctivitis,Blurred vision for 5 days now?,"Hi, I'm new so hope I'm doing this correctly was just hoping for some advice as I'm quite scared.On roughly the 18th of August I woke up and noticed my vision particularly in my right eye wasn't what it was everything seemed a little blurry I put it down to just being tired. The day after it became obvious my sight was blurry I could barely read the TV guide. This is happening mainly in my right eye. I'm not sure if my other eye is slightly effected but my right is noticeable. I'm not sure it relevant but before this happened I felt dizzy especially when I lay on my right side. I went to the optician who just did a standard test said my eyes look fine but said I would need glasses only for driving. I told him it's impossible I just woke up with blurred vision of course it will look like I need glasses. I went out that night in a pub and could barely see people standing not far away from me who I could see less than a week ago. I sort medical advice and my doctor believes it may be allergy related so has given me eye drops hypromellose and allergy tablets. I also had my bloods taken today. My vision seems worse today i think as I felt unable to drive. Please can anyone help? I'm really scared. "
Conjunctivitis,Patterns appearing in both eyes!,"Small but geometric -ish shape. This changes in 1/2 hour or more, the shape gets larger forming a getting larger approximate 'C' shape to the left of center. It is almost like me seeing a crude kaledescope . Eventually the thng disappears to the left. The shape seems to be of small triangles squares, anything 'sort of' geometric. I can see past it but still have to see the shape. Whichever eye I close I can still see it; close both I can see it! It has now cleared completely as I have not being looking at the sun or any strong light. Is it 'just one of those things' to be tolerated everynow and then. I am 75 and in general good health "

Conjunctivitis,"Every so often, my eyes will randomly start flashing.",my vision will slowly (about 3-4 seconds) start to pixelate and flash red and yellow. When this happens I get a little dizzy and my eyes feel tingly and fizzy. After about 6-7 seconds it starts to fade back to normal and then it's fine. I've looked this up online and nothing matches it at all. I've started getting used to it and I'm even able to walk down the stairs when it happens. One thing I've noticed is that it happens sometimes several times a day in the winter and it happens when I've been outside and it's really hot and dry. No other symptoms. Only dizziness and the pixely red and yellow flashes.

Yesterday the consultant said he would fit them. This was quite out of the blue, and I had no idea what they were. So I declined because I am allergic to all eye drops except the preservative free ones, and just having him touch my eyes, means I have a terrible couple of days trying to settle them down. "

Conjunctivitis,getting tests done quickly,"Hello. I am new to this discussion. My husband has been diagnosed with AMD and last week had tests at eye clinic. Now they are almost sure it is wet-AMG so made another appointment for the dye=test, but not until 28th july and that is nearly 3 weeks wait. The Macular Degeneration Society haave been helpful but say that this wait is far too long, as there will then be another wait to get the injection treatment. we tried to see if private treatment was possible but without success except that each injection would cost about £1500!

My eyesight seems ""off"" certain patterns bother my eyes like rugs, grass, blinds etc. it makes me almost dizzy i also have this constant feeling of being stoned. Between my eyes hurts sporadically I had x-rays and they ruled out sinus issues and sinus meds dont do anything. I have bad eyesight to begin with and wear contacts when I switch to my glasses the feeling of being ""high"" increases and when I stand on my porch I feel really weird and uneasy. I have had multiple blood tests that have come out normal and have seen a neurologist who said she didnt think it it was neurological I just had an eye exam last year and other than my crappy eyesight they didnt notice anything."

Conjunctivitis,Allergic red eye condition,hello just and update had red and watery eyes since last April have been on and off steroid drops since then. When weaned off the steroid drops it would come back within a week. Had lots of tests with no reason or cure for this. Went to the optician about 5 weeks ago and eye pressure was very high so he took me off the steroids drops. Strange the symptoms have disappeared and have not returned. Hope it doesn't as it was quite distressing my eyes looked like an alien and would close up really small. Fingers crossed......still on list for allergy test which I will have if I ever get seen ?
Conjunctivitis,Glassy eyes with broken veins ?,"hi I've being having problems with my eyes for about a month now. Unfortunately I can't get an opticians appointment until September. Both of my eyes look overly shiny/ glassy, not really white and with lots of tiny veins. They just don't look healthy at all. My right eye in particular feels tired and strained and sometimes the eyelid looks very swollen in comparison to my left eye. Also, I can constantly see the side of my nose in my field of vision from the right side and it's driving me crazy. I've cut down time spent looking at computer screens and I don't watch t.v. at all.

Conjunctivitis,Damage to Optic Nerve,"Hi there, a few weeks ago I was having frequent headaches and occassionally feeling lightheaded with floaters. I went to the opticians and they referred me to the opthalmologist who put eye drops in and said that at the back of my left eye the optic nerve was sheeted. (I don't understand what this term means and cannot see anything on the internet to explain either) He just said that I didn't have any other symptoms for Optic Neuritis and wasn't sure but didn't think it was anything sinister. I am now waiting for a scan of the eye to see what that shows.However, the last couple of weeks I have been getting pins and needles all over my body, mainly in arms and legs. I've also had general aching pains.I have read online about symptoms and they point to all kinds of things, Fibromyalgia, Anxiety and possibly MS. As you can imagine this has really scared me as I have read that probelms with the optic nerve can also be related.Has anyone else had these symptoms or are they too few for me to be making assumptions?"
Conjunctivitis,"Okay I need help, I think my eyes are deteriorating ","I've attached a video of my eye movements when I 'squint' my eyes, I've noticed a change in my eye movements, more prominently with my left eye, and I have a twitch in that eye too (which has only come about recently). My girlfriend noticed this earlier today and I've been paranoid ever since. Can anybody shed any light on what my eyes are doing and why they're making me feel dizzy and disorientated soon after squinting?When I squint I feel a heavy strain on my eyes, more so my left and eventually gives me a headache. Also, I feel like my eye is out of place, which I know is unlikely, but that's the only way I can describe it.Thanks a lot,Ben."

Conjunctivitis,"Recurring eye inflammation for 8 months. Please help, no one can tell me what's wrong!","Hi there. I'm really needing yor help as im becoming desperate! I'm 21 years old, female in Australia. Around 8 months ago I had a case of conjuctivitis (or what I think may have been conjunctivitis). The white of my eye was all red, swollen, very sore, and there was a tiny little bit of yellow pus in the corner of my eye, after I removed the pus I did not get anymore. My eye just remained red and very sore. I was given chlorsig drops by my gp and symptoms went away (stayed on drops for 5 days). Anyway to make a long story short, it has come back 16 times in the same eye over the last 8 months. I have tried chlorsig drops, chlorsig ointment, tobrex drops and ointment, patanol (as opthamologist thought it may be allergies), acular, and have also tried eye lubricating drops. The infection only comes back in the left eye and has only moved to the right eye once throughout the 8 months. I was referred to an opthamologist at around the 4 month mark and have had two blood tests and urine tests. Everything came back normal and chlamydia and aids came back negative. I should mention, when I do get an attack there's only the slightest bit of pus in the corner of my left eye and my lashes are not stuck together. When I do have an attack my eye is red all over, it's very hard to see out of and I have noticed that the vision in my right eye has deteriorated hugely. I've been to an optometrist at the start and I could read to the 4th line of the eye test and now I can only get to the second. I'm really looking for some help as im getting very worried. I've been to over 20 doctor visits and 3 opthamologist appointments and they just keep telling me to wash my hands and to not touch my face. Ps: I have chucked my makeup and have not worn it in 3 months and I am very hygienic. I always ensure my hands are washed and bring disinfectant hand gel with me everywhere. Im beginning to think if this is even conjunctivitis? I know I shouldn't trust google but I can't find anything that says that conjunctivitis leaves you with deteriorating vision. I had perfect vision out of both eyes and now if I close my right eye and look out my left, everything is a blur (this is when I do not have any of the symptoms). At the moment I'm just playing a waiting game and sitting here waiting for it to come back again. I should also mention that I have had multiple eye tests and my optometrist said there were some small dots in the back of my eyes but he said not to worry about them? I don't know if this could have anything to do with my symptoms? And I have had multiple eye swabs with the swab coming back negative for any bugs.I would just really like some help, as even my opthamologist has said 'I have no idea what it is' - his words precisely.Thank you for your time and I hope to hear from you soon! Olivia."
Conjunctivitis,Anyone having possible side effects from Avastin?,"My first shot was April 2014. In June I was sent to the ER because the doc-in-the-box felt I was having a blood clot. Sot did I. My left leg was swollen just like it did in 2011 from a blood clot. However, after testing, they said that wasn't the problem. I told them I had just started taking Avastin, but no one seemed to pay attention. That leg and ankle are still swollen and my scratching in the middle of the night is scaring me. i'm diabetic.My geriatric doctor put me on lasix twice, along with a water pill hydrosomething. Neither worked.The results of the latest bloodwork for diabetes showed low potassium. My doctor said Lasix could cause this. However, when i researched side effects of Avastin, I came up with low potassium.I'm very concerned about this. My geriatric doc thinks the swollen leg is from inflammation from herniated disks. I've had this for several years. I'm concerned it is the Avastin; otherise, why did my leg take so long to swell.If anyone else is taking Avastin and is having side effects, i would like to know. This drug is like lecentis. A very tiny amount is shot inside your eye every few weeks."
Conjunctivitis,Blurriness in left eye and doctors don't know what it is,"I started feeling a sort of blurriness in my left eye in October. Thinking it was just my prescription, I went to an optometrist to have a refraction done. The optometrist was unable to find my prescription for my left eye, and recommended I go to a retina specialist. After my appointment with the retina specialist, I was told that there was nothing wrong with my left eye, and on top of that, he told me that my left eye was in better condition than my right eye. A couple of months later I noticed the blurriness getting worse, so I went to see an ophthamologist. He too couldn't find anything wrong with my left eye, and recommended I go see a nerve specialist. After a couple of tests done with the nerve specialist, same deal. He couldn't find anything wrong. My left eye keeps getting worse and I can't figure out what the issue is. I sense a kind of blurriness which seems as though my left eye is unable to focus on anything. According to the ophthamologist I saw, he was able to prescribe me enough to make my eye sight 20/20, but the issue was still there. Although I had been prescribed 20/20, I was still seeing this blurriness/non-focusable feeling in my left eye. I have worn glasses all my life, and I use my computer a lot, but I have never faced an issue like this. I have been through five appointments, and all of them tell me the same thing. They all tell me that there's nothing wrong, and that my left eye seems to be in better condition than my right. I'm really scared that I might go blind on one eye, and I am sitting here doing nothing about it. A couple of years ago, one of my eye doctors told me I have a mild case of dry eyes. Now I don't know if that could be the cause of the issue, but it sure is relevant information. I'm going to make another appointment with this nerve specialist to take two more tests which involve examining how the nerves from the retina to the brain transmit, and another similar test which I can't recall. Hopefully one of these tests shows some kind of solution to this problem, but I wanted to know if anyone out there has had the same problem, and of course if you have a solution. Any help is appreciated."
Conjunctivitis,Eye muscles (far sight-double image),"Hello,I see a double image when I look in far, but this usually happens after I spent 1-2 hours watching my phone's screen in unwanted positions such as laying on a bed. It is the only trigger for seeing a double image in far, meaning if I don't watch phone like described earlier, my eyes do not face with the problem at all.Only after 1-2 hour session with the phone, I feel my eye muscles cannot push the eye to make it a single image for me to perceive in far. My sight isn't good at seeing things in far, yet this is the first time I experience a pretty much sudden weakness of my eye muscles.After I rest my eyes, they seem to be able to see a single image in far, yet, as to the reason why it is happening for them to weaken after watching phone's screen - is unclear for me, but I try to avoid that in the future. I suspect it is to deal with the pressure in the eyes.Another fact is that, after I let my eyes look on nearby objects, trying to look in far, sometimes leads to a successful single image, yet, not for long. It feels like it tries to break out to a double output. So I concluded it is related to my eye muscles.As for the treatment...I was wondering if it is useful to do the eye training such as moving eyes diagonally, vertically, horizontally, pushing muscles responsible for seeing things in far and in close... would these exercises help to stabilize my eye muscles? Or could some eye-cleansing drops help? (seeing few stuff floating in my vision as well, perhaps it could be good to use eye drops as well)Thank you very much for taking your time to read this discussion and I appreaciate your reply.Thank you a lot!Kind regards,Gergio"

Conjunctivitis,Inflammatory Filamental Keratitis Anyone?,"Extremely dry burning eyes is what keratitis amounts to. It's a side effect of RA, which I've had for nine years along with a number of other less severe auto-immune conditions.I've had keratitis for over a year now and tried every possible avenue for cure and management, including a slew of different drops and gels and ointments, as well as a long-term regime of Restasis, which as far as I know is the only thing the pharmaceutical industry – and the ophthalmologists – suggest might cure it.It only made it worse for me!Keratitis is a kind of drying out of the three vital layers that protect the cornea and keep it lubricated. When the dryness has removed the oily surface and the tear layer, it reaches the bottom layer (called mycene, I think) and then, while further trying to protect the eye, that layer breaks up into filaments which lodge onto the cornea causing humungous irritation, as if all kinds of assorted junk had landed under my eyelid!?Sometimes these filaments are even visible to the naked eye =14pxas white spots=14px when they appear over the iris. Sorry for all this gruesome detail, but I've nver come across anyone else who has had this kind of problem and am badly looking to share stories and maybe find some new avenues of help where the professionals have failed me...Anyone who has ever had windswept sawdust land in their eye will be able to imagine what a distressing thing this can be, and I do hope someone out there has found some answers...Thank you...Light "
Conjunctivitis,Severe eye pain/heartburn,Hello. I have severe eye pain. The eye doctor told me last year that I have dry eyes so I started using eye drops. The eye drops don't seem to help. My eyes burn so bad that I can't concentrate and all I want to do is close them and go to sleep. I also notice at times when my eyes sting that I get heartburn. I'm thinking I have something other than dry eyes. What is going on with me? I feel like my eyes are getting worse. This occurs more and more. 
Conjunctivitis,Squint Corrected with Botox - double vision? ,"Hello All,I've had a squint all my life (30 years) had two previous surgeries that did not work. My right eye turns inward. Recently I was refered to hospital for Botox treatment. This was carried out 9 days ago.My eye is now straight. (Yay) I am however suffering from double vision when I look to the left and what I can only describe as slight 'ghost' double images (not constant) that seems to appear randomly and when looking in any direction, Has anyone had Botox and experienced something similar? I'm just looking for reassurance that the double vision will pass and I can continue with the Botox treatment? The botox kicked in 3 days after it was administered so I've only had double vision for about 6 days. "
Conjunctivitis,Sudden lov out if corner of eye now flashing lights,Hi I wonder if anyone on here could advise me please. My mum is 87. Yesterday she woke up and she said half of her vision was gone in one eye. Today she says she is now seeing flashing coloured lights. Am worried its serious but she refuses to go to A and E or an optician. She has however agreed to go to the doctor if I ca get her an appointment. I have to ring up after 2 today to see if there are any afternoon appointments. Has anyone had any experience of this as I am worried that the go isnt an eye specialist.
Conjunctivitis,esotropia is coming back?,"Hello, my name is Dylan and I'm 16.Ever since I was little, I had been wearing glasses to correct my accommodative esotropia where my left eye would turn inwards when I tried to focus on something close to me. 5 or so years ago the opticians told me that I no longer needed glasses and I'd only had minor problems since then.But recently I've noticed that the symptoms are coming back. Not as often as when I was little, but when I have been reading something or focusing on something for a while, I will get a weird (not painful) sensation in my eyes and I experience double vision which only goes away if I either cover my left eye or ""unfocus"", which is more relaxing for my eyes but when it happens everything is really blurry and I can't read anything. My eyes will often unfocus on their own when I relax and although I can focus when this happens I have to try really hard and it puts a strain on my eyes.Is this normal for people who have outgrown their accommodative esotropia? Or is mine just coming back?"
Conjunctivitis,Dirt specs and flashing lights at night,"At night I see flashing lights and they disappear. After a little while they come back whenever I move my eyes. Even during daytime, I can feel specks of dust particles in both my eyes, some of them big and others are small but no flashing lights at daytime. These have only started in the last couple of weeks and don't know what they are. Has anyone come across these flashing lights and dust specks? Do I need a referral from a doctor to see an ophthalmologist?"

Conjunctivitis,Difference in opticians prescriptions,"I went to one optician to get an eye test. My right eye was measured as: Sph: +2.25, Cyl: +0.25 Axis: 30. I went to another to get lenses and glasses. They entered my right eye on their system as: Sph: +2.5 Cyl: -, Axis: 120. When I queried this I was told it amounted to the same thing. Since I am not entirely happy with the result, the question is do these different sets of figures produce the same lens?"
Conjunctivitis,problem in my eye vision,"Im male and 17 years old. Im suffering from this problem for the past 1 year.This happend for the first time in the last year: One day I came to my home after playing cricket at night. I was normal and lying in the bed. suddenly something happend to my eyes. There were some grains started to come in my eye vision on my left eye. Then they slowly started increasing. Then it passed coming into my right eye and both the eyes were affected. My grandma and my mom were standing in front of me but their face were fully blurry. I wasnt able to recognize their face and any object in fornt of me. I was able to see the objects but they were full of blur and cant see a definite image. It was like illusion. It is very difficult to explain. I was totally shocked. I thought that i will loose my vision. I ran into washroom and washed my face with plenty of water. But not use of it. Then I switched off the light and went to sleep in dark to see whether it cures. I was in bed for about half an hour. When I woke up it has gone but I was feeling somewhat tired. I had my tution class at that time. As it is very important i went for it.after some 10 or 20 min my vision was clear and I felt good. This incident happend for me for the first time. I thought that some chemicals in my brain might have mixed and i will be alright after they settle(as shown in movies). But after some days I experienced the same problem.This is happening following the first time till now and is slightly different:The same thing occured but this time it was slightly different. The vision was like the camera placed in dark room(some minute brown red dots). At this time my right eye was ok.only my left eye was affected.This time also i washed my face immediately and it gone after washing. I have started experiencing this problem again and again. All these incident which occured for the 2nd,3rd time and so on lasted only for about 1-3 minutes. I watch computer,tv,mobile for many hours daily. Mostly from night to 4.00 am morning. After that only i go to sleep and get up at 11.00 am or 12 noon. I thought that watching computer is the reason and I left watching computer for about a month. This occured for one time even after stopping watching computer. Then when i started watching computer again at that time also it occured. Then I went for a eye checkup and I thought that I got power in my eyes so only this is happening. Till that I was not wearing any specs. My power was -0.5 in both eyes. Then I started wearing specs.I thought after wearing specs this will not occur. But it started occuring after wearing specs also. Till today i have encountered this problem for about 8-12 times. Last week also I encountered this problem. Sorry for my bad english. This situation is very difficult to explain in english.please help me. I cant figure out what is the reason behind this whether it is a deficiency or due to computer or any problem in my eye."

Conjunctivitis,"Eyes go out of focus, light headed and dizzy","I am 60 years old. Since last week I have had three of these episodes. I always had optical auras but nothing like this. I take care of an elderly morning in the morning and afternon. Last Thursday I was leaving a note for her daughter and all of a sudden my eyes went funky, I could not focus and I got very dizzy and light headed. I sat there for a few minutes and it went away but then my head began to hurt. It happened again on Saturday when I was at home and then again this morning when I was in the woman's room trying to take her blood pressure. I could not focus and felt very dizzy and light headed. By the time I got home my head hurt...I wouldn't say migraine, but headache on both sides of my head. I also have been experiencing, since last Thursday (could it be connected?) that the palms of my hands are red and I have a burning sensation. I have had eczema in the past and when I googled this it could be any number of things (eczema, MS symptoms, liver issues, kidney issues). I am beginning to get freaked out over all of this. So far, since Thursday morning I have had three episodes of my eyes going all funky and that same afternoon when it began, the redness and burning on the palms of my hands. I am usually stressed out, have panic attacks, but have never experienced anything like this. I have to go out of town with mom this coming up Sunday and I am worried that if it happens when I am driving I will have to pull over until it passes and then make a doctor's appointment for next week. I have been reading various posts throught out this site and have read where people have suffered the same, have gone to doctor's, had tests, blood work, MRI's and nothing was found. I am getting scared. "
Conjunctivitis,Eye/Vision problem.,"It all started when one day I noticed a quite a few floaters[Greyish/black in color and somewhat big]. I'd never really had any lingering ones before but I didn't think much of it. A few days later I noticed, as best as I can explain it, looked like lights flickering in vision. I initially thought it only happened under artificial lighting but I now have seen it in natural lighting/dimness as well. The best way I can describe it is that when I move my eyes say up/down/left or right (I've never seen it happen while my eyes were still AS FAR AS I AM AWARE) I notice this, what I know to be, blackness it sometimes only takes up a small amount of vision but some times it takes up most of it,central and peripheral, it only lasts for a SPLIT second and it happens in BOTH eyes. I've included a picture with an example of what it looks like for the split second it happens. http://oi61.tinypic.com/2hfjp12.jpg When the black ""flicker"" appeared I went and got my eyes tested and other than needing a new pair of prescription glasses (which I haven't gotten yet) they didn't find anything to worry about. The eye test took a while and they dilated my pupils which didn't go back to normal for around 48 hours and i had lingering side effects it seemed, for example my right eye for 3-4 days after just felt.. weird, that's the only way i can describe it.Other symptoms I have been experiencing which may or not be connected is, slight fatigue, my eyes seem to be bloodshot, and when I stare at things, aka a blank wall or busy pattern it kind of feels like my eyes are seeing static or shaking violently like as in it almost seems like my eyesight is vibrating with a ton of little dots i can notice it almost ALWAYS. I also experience this in dark or dim rooms[also is perfectly lit rooms] it looks like thousands of slightly visible white dots are moving, also can be described as static. It is starting to freak me out more and more. I also sometimes wake up with a little bit of clear mucus on my eyes."
Conjunctivitis,restasis,"I'm curious if anyone was told by there own eye Dr aside from dry eyes. If they also were told they have dry patches/spots on one eye like myself. I'm using this stuff, I go back two mos. To see if its working. I guess the only way I'll continue the drop is if he says the left eye has improved. With dry spots. I'll then have faith in the product. Seems you waste alot of this I noticed. One vial could last a couple of uses but isn't sanitary. Saline I use sometimes in eyes. But all in all the eyes feel good and contacts , air optix are working well."

Conjunctivitis,Ulcer like thing under eyelid,About a week ago I went to the Dr about a painful almost ulcer like crater on the bottom left corner of my right eye just under the eyelid. Its not immediately obious but I noticed it due to discomfort thinking I had something in my eye.Dr said not to worry about it and to just bath the eye.Few days on I noticed that the ulcer thing was also on the top left under my right eyelid and exactly mirrored on to my left eye now as well so there are 4 of these things.It causes discomfort and are constantly giving me very tired and dry eyes.Any ideas?Sorry i am new to this so hopefully this is how you do this forum 
Conjunctivitis,vertically double vision,"When I compare the images from my right and left eyes, by covering each in turn, one is higher vertically than the other. It is the same with or without glasses. I normally compensate for this quite adequately, but when I am tired - after a long walk - the images separate. Is this common? Can glasses be made to correct this, such as with a prism-like deflection?"

Though did start wearing sun-glasses.A visit to a doctor resulted in - 'mild conjunctivitis' - with some eye-drops that didn't seem to make any difference.Still, finding them pain full, indeed to me there seemed a split in the white, showed my Partner who could see in one eye two bumps!Visit the doctors again - Pinguecula - nothing to worry about it's benign, given 'tear' capsules, which do help.But it's the puzzle how it happened, and will the discomfort reoccur? Is it hair care, household cleaning, or the codydramol (for arthritis), or even the wash/dryer is suspect!!?When will I get back to 'normal'?? "
Conjunctivitis,Tilted and indistinct optic disc,I took my 11 year old daughter for an eye exam yesterday and the optician told me that the angle the nerve entered the eye was slightly tilted. She gave me a letter to give to my GP who would further refer her to the eye clinic. It wasn't an urgent referral but I am worried about this. Her eyesight was perfect and she doesn't suffer and headaches eye. Any advice/reassurance would b grateful. 
Conjunctivitis,I've been having eye problems (hallucinations),"Sorry for any grammar mistakes and Thanks I've been having these weird hallucinations since May 2014.When its really bright outside I keep seeing black lines following my eyes and when I stop moving my eyes so does the black line stop moving and disappears.The same thing happens when I watch a fluorescent lamp in a mall or a shop, but those black lines get semi-transparent and I can still see them(these lines get transparent only when I see that kind of lamps).Also when im at home and I enter my room I see something like a double vision of my lamp ,but less smalled in my lower eye sight.I think this is happening for a year now since I started smoking weed.One time the weed smoke entered my eyes and it burned like hell.After I started seen these things I stopped smoking, which is 6 months now.I was also really depressed,anxious and this vision thing makes it worse. "
Conjunctivitis,Just recently found out. Just a question,"So recently found out i have macular degeneration, but dont know much details just yet. Looking up stuff to learn more about it. 1st timer here, so sorry if my writing is so slopply.Got my 1st Injection in my left eye, my vision seems to be blurrier then before i had the treatment is dis normal?"
Conjunctivitis,"Blurred vision in one eye, being sent on emergency appointment to hospital","Hi all,I am new to the forums but just wanted some advice. For the last few days I have had blurred vision in my right eye. Its a bit like something has steamed my glasses up from the middle to the bottom and my vision is hazy. This came on after I wearing contact lenses and I thought I had something in my eye.I went to an opticians today and they can't see anything wrong so are now sending me on an emergency hospital appointment. Two opticians looked at my vision and I could hear them discussing tumours, ulcers etc. I am now waiting for a call to go to hospital and am petrified!! I do have crohns disease but that is under control at the moment so not sure that could be a link. Im actually sat in tears though worried sick!Any help or advice would be appreciated. Thanks"
Conjunctivitis,Drusen and very early macular degeneration,"A posterior vitreous detachment occurred in my right eye two weeks ago. I was told by Southampton General Emergency Eye Clinic that it was age related and to go home. Not happy with this decision I decided on a second opinion at the local opticians who offered OCT scanning. It was picked up I had fluid filled cysts in the macular area of both eyes suggestive of ""drusen"" and early signs of macular degeneration. I'm really surprised it wasn't picked up two weeks earlier on my visit to Eye A&E. I'm due to visit the gp tomorrow and will take the scan and letter to show her. As I have a choice of hospitals to visit, does anyone recommend Southampton? I'm actually drawn to going to Moorfields, London. That's only because I worked Agency there in the 80's. I'm keen to hear from others who have these conditions, and if poss, has anyone used Moorfields?"
Conjunctivitis,pterygium re growth,"Hi,I had pterygium removal surgery on both my eye in November 2014.Not only was it the mos irritable surgery, both the pterygium has returned and seem to be growing at a rapid pace.I have been told that not only am i rather young (26) to have pterygium, but that due to my age they should not grow back especially not at this rate. Anyone had the same operation, perhaps twice. "
Conjunctivitis,Unilateral conjunctivitis for 3 months,"I have an unilateral palpebral conjunctivitis for the past 3 months now. The bottom eyelid is also rly swollen and red. My eyeball itself isn’t really red though. Discharge is minimal, if I even have it? No tearing, but eye feels kinda dry sometimesMy doctor ordered a lab test which suggests it’s a Staph infection, but the prescribed fusithalmic acid I’ve been using for the past 2 weeks haven’t done anything. I was also given hydrocortisone to use on my bottom eyelid when the swelling is really bad but I try to avoid itAny ideas what this could be? some super strain of Staph that’s resistant to fucithalmic, or is it something else? I just think it’s weird it hasn’t spread to the other eye…Thanks! PS I tested negative for HIV, HPV, Hep B, chlamydia & gonnorrhea a week ago. They didn’t sample my eye though."
Conjunctivitis,painful eyes,I had my eyes tested 10 months ago and the opthalmologist said I have a prescription but not strong enough for glasses. In November I started a new job with the civil service and it involves me being in front of the computer all day making calls. However the past week and a half I have left work everyday with a headache around my right temple and a painful feeling behind each eye. Also occasionAl blurred vision as if my eyes are refocusing. Thoughts? Or just a hypochondriac?
Conjunctivitis,Just noticed a recent change in my vision.,"Only this last week or so I have started noticing like a sort of shadow effect round the edges of things, in particular on the TV where there is white writing with a black or blue background or if like this afternoon the sun was shining through the window onto the white washing basket and behind it is a dark coloured unit. I could see a shadow round the edge of the washing basket. Its things like that. I can even see it on my mobile phone sometimes too depending on the colours on the screen. I'm scared now. Anyone have any experience of this? Thanks."
Conjunctivitis,Eye problems,"Hi there for a few weeks now been getting occasional headaches, eyes feel heavy and have been sore. Went to optician and wen they took the photo there was a small white patch at the back of my eye. She ace me drops to relieve any dryness and referred me to eye specialist. She said didn't think was anything to worry about but can't help but....She said my vision was fine. I have also been getting pain in back of neck and in my arm. Also woke with numbness and pins & needles. I know it seem strange but dnt know if connected with eye probs? I.e nerves maybe?I am worried could be serious and optician just didn't say does anyone know about these eye changes? "

Conjunctivitis,"Mystery eyelid swelling, only in the right eye.","I am a 17 year old female. When I was 16 I started to get these repeated cases of a swollen and puffy right eyelid. At first they treated it as conjunctivitis but it took 3 weeks to fully heal. It occurs about once every 3 months and there are no triggers that we know of. It lasts around 1-2 weeks depending on the treatment, they've tried antibiotics, antihistemines and steroids. The problem is, nothing has stopped it coming back. I had allergy testing done and they came back high (which we knew anyway), and I'm already on daily fexofenodine for these. If it was just the puffy eye I could deal with it, even when it gets to the point where I cannot physically pull the lids apart, I just hate how unwell it makes me feel. I get sinus pain for atound a week prior to the episode, so I can generally tell when it will happen. Then when it does I get headaches, feel like theres pressure building up behind my eynd I get a temperature whilst it also making es me really tired. It has also made my eyes very sensetive to light. I have recently been to see a dermatologist with a speciality in eyelids as all the doctors/opthamologists I have seen are baffled by me! She thinks it is probably caused by allergies but we don't get why it is only the right eye, and neither does she. I have been booked in for an MRI scan to check that nothing has been missed, and its not cellulitis or a thyroid problem. I posted on here to see if anyone has any advice or similar stories? I'm in the middle of my A levels and have already taken too much time off because of it! I just realky want it to go away and never come back!Any help is welcome!"

Conjunctivitis,Flashes in right eye but I don't have retinal detachment ,"I have been experiencing sudden eye Flashes in my right eye from Last 15-20 days..I got my eyes checked Last week , Doctor has checked my eyes properly and he just prescribed me GenTeal eye drops and told me to wear glasses which can cover whole eye (I was wearing Rimless glasses at that time) so I changed my frame too but it's still there.

Conjunctivitis,Any ideas as to what my problem is?,"Hi,In early December, I decided I would get in my loft and deal with a pest problem we have had for quite a while. I decided to mess about with some loft insulation which was quite dusty and I began tearing it up to plug up some holes in the hope it would stop this rat or mouse. Unfortunately I was very silly and did not wear any eye protection and it got very dusty up there and I was coughing a lot. I came down and about 1/2 hour later to then have my eyes start to burn quite bad, so I proceeded to wash them out with water and got my friend to pull a tiny bit of black dirt out of my left eye in the lower lid. All night long my eyes kept burning so I put some moisturising eye drops in which calmed them down. This all pointed to dry eye syndrome but my eyes were fine up until the incident. I went to my docs who put me on some ointment for conjunctivitus which didn't help and then went to an optician who said I have ""Dry eye"". Not happy with this diagnosis, I went to the A&E eye doctor who said there was nothing wrong with my eyes but prescribed me with some Hylo-Tear to help soothe the eyes. Unfortunately 6 weeks on, my eyes still burn, itch, sting feel dry but don't go red - I get headaches and the pain in my eyes is very very uncomfortable and I am having difficulty in working with this.This week I decided to go to an ""Optometrist"" and spend a lot of money on having a thorough eye test and all came back fine and he did administer a green dye solution to my eye and said I don't have dry eye apart from a very very minor area in my left eye with which he says does not even get classed as ""Dry Eye Syndrome"" and all checks out fine.I am at my wits end with this as no one can tell me what the problem is, surely it's gotta to be an infection caused from the dust, but 6 weeks on is quite long. I hope someone can help me. Thank you."

Conjunctivitis,Eye Problems?,"Hey everyone, I'm new to this discussion board.Lately I started having some weird eye problems, but also I do have an anxiety disorder so i'm wondering if that has something to do with it or not. First off, I'm 21 years old, never had any problem with eyes. Lately, I've been having new anxiety problems as well, I've had it all my life pretty much. Now I feel like I see a lot of floaters but it's when I'm looking at the computer all day or have my attacks, and also when I look outside the window then look at my screen, I see some flashes of lights as well. I know thats normal when you look at something bright, but I feel like it happens even when things aren't all that bright outside, or a light isn't all that bright. "
Conjunctivitis,Central Retinal Vein Occlusion,I have CVRO and have an appointment in 2 weeks to have extensive test done to determine the best prodcedure for treatment.

From everything I've been readling sounds like either treatment is a toss of the nice. Any input on this would be appreciated. Thans
Conjunctivitis,Two beat Nystagmus diagnosed, I am 80 and had cataract surgery in 2013 and had thorough eye examinations at that time and also a few years ago when I did not do well in field vision tests when glaucoma was wrongly suspected . I was always short sighted and wore glasses from the age of 12. Since cataract surgery I have twice had eye tests the last one being on 14th January without any problems being noted apart from slight condensation in the lower corner of the left lens and that the right lens had been slightly scratched when being put in.I had earlier mentioned to my GP that I had been having headaches since the end of October and he referred me to a headache clinic and a neurologist who I am still waiting for appointments with. I also mentioned the headaches to the optician who found no reason for them.I then had an appointment with the blood pressure clinic and again mentioned the headaches. The consultant there examined my eyes but did not mention a problem. I had a letter from him today to say that he had arranged for a CT head scan saying that cranial nerves II-XII were all intact but a two beat nystagmus noted in the left eye on lateral gaze. https://patient.info/doctor/nystagmus?If his diagnosis is correct this seems to be a condition with many causes.I’m sure that this Forum will have others with this condition. 
Conjunctivitis,epiphora,"My right eye has started to weep quite badly more than a year ago at the age of 49. I had also several infections during the year due to the epiphora. The opthalmologist said that there was nothing to do about it and I had just to get used to it. He believes that it may have been triggered by the menopause. I have/had dry eyes anyway which could be a cause. I remember exactly when it started after a day having used extensively the underground and I thought at first that the weeping came from wind/draught. I had mild conjunctivitis and at first we thought I had an allergy. I had three periods of a couple of weeks when my eye was fine (mainly after treatment with antibiotics), but eventually it started again with no particular reason. I have also been in Portugal, New Zealand and a few other countries (warmer or colder) but there was no change whatsoever. I am not stressed and I have not put on makeup for quite a while. However, I very often have pain behind the root of the nose and oddly I feel some pain in the muscles around the eye. I told this to the doctor and he thinks there is no correlation.I am normally not complaining. However, I do not know about you but I cannot get used to it. I can just accept it. By the way, a pharmacist told me that a lady started epiphora in her late forties and at 92 she still has it."
Conjunctivitis,I need some help deciphering my eye test prescription,"Hi,Unfortunatelly I need new pair of glasses and I went to few different places to get my eyes checked and they all seem to give me a different prescription.

Conjunctivitis,Cloudy Vision and Other Symptoms. ,"Hi. I've been having some vision issues for the past month. I'm a male, 28 years old. I have never really had any eye issues besides intermittent eye strain when I used the computer or played video games for too long. I sit in front of a computer for most of my work day.Around a month ago, I developed what I thought was eye strain again, so I took a break from looking at screens for a couple days, which generally fixes the issue. My eyes were not getting any better, so I started using drops. I used Clear Eyes Triple Action and some cheaper artificial tears. Not being an expert, I dropped these right onto my eyes instead of my eye lids or the corner of my eyes, which generally sent a shock to my system when they hit my eye. I was experiencing blurred vision (especially in my right eye), an inability to focus, occassional dizziness, and what felt like swelling. I also tried some eye exercises for about a week, which just made me dizzier, so I stopped doing them.A couple of weeks ago, I ran out of the clear eyes, and I picked up some Visine Tired Eye. I used these twice a day for 2 days, and on the last dosage, I looked up at my kitchen, and it looked like the room was full of smoke. Ever since then, I've been having cloudy vision and what seems like a hard time adjusting to light. It also seems like some colors are washed out and colors are not as deep as they once were.Last week, I went to the optometrist, and they did a bunch of tests on my eyes. I have astigmatism in both eyes, which is worse in the right (20/30 and 20/25 in the left). She also found a very small spot of inflammation on my left cornea. I was prescribed steroid/antibiotic drops for a week, which I'm nearly finished with. The cloudiness seems to be going up and down. One say it will seem better, and the next it is worse again. My eyes are also extremely red and sometimes mucousy in the morning.I will be getting my glasses on Tuesday and I have another test for my optic nerves a week after that. My question is, has anyone ever experienced anything close to this? Is this normal with astigmatism? Can anyone help me figure out what is going on? I haven't had a blood test done, but I'm pretty sure I'm not diabetic. i have no other symptoms of that. Thanks in advance!"
Conjunctivitis,"Light sensitivity, headaches & blurred vision","So for a month or two now (kinda lost track of how long) I have been suffering from quite bad sensitivity to light, especially at supermarkets/bright days/using computers. I have always had pretty sensitive eyes but now they seem to be worse. I sometimes use eye drops which seem to help with this.My vision is also ever so slightly blurry at all times, not sure how long this has been going on for.I seem to be getting headaches most days as well, especially when I am using computers/doing work or what not.I have been to the eye doctor and he prescribed me a slight astigmatism, slightly higher in my right eye than my left. I am now wearing glasses to work/drive/read/etc but I am still having the same symptoms. Should I expect my glasses to be improving my symptoms if I was prescribed astigmatism? Does this mean the glasses could be wrong or it's an underlying issue causing the symptoms?I have also been to my GP a few times about my headaches now and they say it's nothing to worry about after checking my eyes and whatnot. Should I be pushing for more tests, if yes which? Or do you think it's nothing to worry about..Obviously this is worrying me now somewhat, any info/help/advice on what to do would be great. Thanks in advance."
Conjunctivitis,Burning eyes,"Im 22 and For the past month or two I have been woken up in the middle of the night(not every night )to my left(usually) eye stinging and practically gushing tears.

Conjunctivitis,The plot thickens...as does the macular oedema!,"Hi siesta cove (Beverly) and anyone else interested,I've just got back from the eye clinic, where, surprise surprise, the consultant hadn't come across anyone else experiencing the same problem as me. He said the black ring I now have on my retina is not a side effect of the Lucentis and he couldn't see anything wrong with the retina or the vitreous humour. The swelling is back, though, so he is keen for me to have some sort of treatment before too long. I'm due to get a second opinion from the other retina specialist and have an angio-thing (dye in the eye - forgotten its name, and can't google without losing this post!) he is now talking about me having Ozurdex, which lasts longer - 3months, but has higher risk of cataracts and raised pressure in the eye. Waiting to hear when the appt will be as the other consultant is due to have 2 weeks off. I love this waiting around!"
Conjunctivitis,What is this in my eye? ,"So a few months ago I had scleritis in my left eye and then uveitis in my right eye. Blood tests showed nothing, they think uveitis caused by protein buildup on my contact lens.Stopped the stereoid a few weeks ago (been on since october -on and off) and now my left eye starts getting red again. Minimal pain, sometimes quite frustrating. Can anyone tell me what this is on my eye? I've been reading and I think it could be episcleritis? I have an appointment on 4th February, will go sooner if anybody thinks its an emergency. Here is a picture, thanks. http://i.imgur.com/BtfHbEz.jpg"
Conjunctivitis,Sudden eye issues,"I was watching TV with my brother last night when I noticed that it became hard to keep my eyes focused and had a lack of peripheral vision. I also found that bright light light in the dark or a bright computer monitor irritated my eyes. I have always been sensitive to light but this was severe. I had Amblyopia as a kid, but i checked both eyes and they were fine. I called my mother and she said it is normal for your eyes ""to flatten out"" as you get older and it meant I was tired. So I went to sleep and in the morning my eyes were fine. But at night I still have the light sensitivity and also with the computer monitor on high brightness. Can someone tell me what are some possible reasons."
Conjunctivitis,Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO),"3 weeks ago I suddenly noticed blurred vision in my left eye and having now seen a eye consultant and had a flouroscein Angiogam it turns out that I have a CRVO to which there is no apparent treatment.I am 56, healthy, sporty and not overweight.From all the reading it appears that some people have tried a steriod injection into the eye and some have tried prednisolone tablets. One report says to thin the blood (asprin) another says the opposite as it could cause further bleeding. Does anyone have any experience or advice that could help me decide what to do?"
Conjunctivitis,Macular hole and cataract,"I had a detached retina in June last year that resulted in a cataract and macular hole. I had an operation on Dec 8th to sort both problems. So far, so good.

Conjunctivitis,Vitamins for eyes--dry macular degeneration,"I was given two samples of vitamins that MAY keep my vision from deterioating due to dry mac, which I've just learned continues even though one has gone ""wet.""Dosage included 400 units of vitamin E. I told my ophthalmologist that the almond milk (2 cups) I drink every day already has that amount of Vitamin E. I wish they would stop adding vitamins to the food we buy. Several articles I have read state that too much Vitamine E can cause very serious side effects including loss of vision ????? stroke and death. Just to name a few. I am also very careful about my diet. He admitted he didn't even know what the daily requirement was for Vitamin E. ?? Then appeared to get in a huff. I've been burned by a doctor giving me too much Vitamin D. I had a kidney stone and she didn't even recognize the symptoms.Then he started in on me just taking lutein. Lutein is easily found in green leafy vegetables such as, kale, spinach, collards and yellow, orange and red fruits and vegetables. In my opinion, there is no need to take this in a pill if you eat these every day. ""They"" don't even know the daily requirement of lutein.Pharmacuetical manufacturers have already had to remove beta carotenes from these vitamins because they caused lung cancer in patients who were FORMER smokers. Now I read that lutein and zeaxanthin are related to Vitamin A and beta carotenes. Should I make my doctor happy or do what I know is best for me? "

Conjunctivitis,Watery Eye,"I have had one eye that waters for several years. I have tried various eye drops, some from GP. Also had the eye syringed but it didn't improve at all. When I am abroad on holiday in the sun, it is much better. It is particulary bad in the winter, I am forever dabbing at it, as the tears run down my face. The GP says it can't be an allergy as it only affects one eye. People offen think I am crying (including GP once when I went about something else). I am at my wits end. Can anyone suggest anything?"
Conjunctivitis,Buzziness/Noise in low light,"Recently I went to a friends place to hang and have some drinks. He had one of those light projectors that shoot lights onto the wall, it was placed on a table. We danced, talked and stared at the lights for hours. Now, everything I look at is buzzing. I don't think it's visual snow as there's no actual form to it unless I concentrate really hard for awhile then I might be able to see some form. I'm really concerned as I can't really focus on anything. In a pitch black room where there's little light, that area would be most obvious. I can't concentrate on anything because even if I'm looking at something bright my peripherals are buzzing. There's constant movement in still things.I'm not sure what caused this but I'm guessing it was those lights maybe it hit my eyes a few times, we were at it for hours. I'm not sure if I should see an optician or an eye specialist. If anyone has any advice, I'd really appreciate it."

Conjunctivitis,"My eyes look weird and i feel diplopia when watching on the right side, what should I do?","Well, one year ago i started having double pictures when i was watching on the right side with my eyes, but it didn't cause me a big problem because it was still normal and I didn't felt it as a big problem. But, recently i started having double images more often even when watching straight but it isn't for the whole time, maybe only when i focus. The problem is that I'am 14 years old male, my friends are telling me that my eyes look weird sometimes and I don't wanna feel like that, I'am scared that my eyes will have a permanent diplopia and I will look completly weird and ugly, I don't want to be alone with no friends or girlfried. I have been on a doctor 3 months ago, he said that I have sometimes problems with diplopia because of the PC, yeah I really think that is the problem because i sit on the computer for about 6 hours a day. The doctor said that the muscle on my left eye is more weak wich causes problem when watcing on the side because it need muscle activity. I want to know if there are any exercises or anything from what i can treat my problem."
Conjunctivitis,Damaged to vitreous humour,"i have now had two injections of Lucentis, following a central retinal vein occlusion in my left eye. The second time, I noticed a dark ring with tiny squiggly lights around the area of swelling. I thought it was just the drug working on the swelling but I still have a dark ring on the retina, causing distortion of vision. A doctor at the eye clinic said it was damage to the vitreous humour and as it hasn't improved, I'm now worried about having any more injections in case I lose any more sighthas anyone else had this?"

Is there any way at all that I can keep my eyes healthy or even improve my perscription by a few diodes? This whole perscription thing has been depressing me and freaking me out, as my myopia doesn't seem to be stabilizing yet. My eyes can get tired, dry and out of focus fast.

When I got this checked out three years ago, the doctor said it was herpes (not the sexually transmitted kind) and he gave me some horrible tasting syrup for it and it went away within a week. About a year ago t kind of wanted to go back, but it never really developed. I don't think it's a sty simply because it's not just a big red lump. It is several small, painful, itchy bumps that get covered in flaky things and it's starting to ooze out this white-yellowish substance. What could it be? Is it herpes again or...? I should also mention I tested positive for influenza on Monday. Could it be related to that? Any help would be helpful."
Conjunctivitis,What are Eye Floater?,"Hi,I feel my eye floaters are spreading in term of count.When I use computer these floaters become more visible.I have heared floaters transforms from solid/thread-like shape to blurry/cloud-like form in span of time.So, my eyes are in trouble? is there any way to remove floaters? would I go through removal surgery after next couple of years?Also I feel like there is a very very light blurry spot in my left eye, I can not point out where it is or whats it shape but it feels like something is there.

Conjunctivitis,My eye hurts since one week,"It is since one week that my left eye is hurting (the sensation is similar to when you have a foreign body in the eye). It started to hurt after I went to the gym and initially I thought is was just because I was tired. Only last Sunday I noticed a spot next to the pupil. I went to the farmacy and I got eye drops (for itchy eyes) but I feel I am getting worse, sometimes I feel the pain in sharper, like if it is coming from inside the eye and not from the surface like in the start. Shall I go to the hospital? There are no eye doctors in my town"

Conjunctivitis,Eye problems - please read,"Hi,I am wondering if someone can help me. My eyes have been causing me a problem lately both in the way I look and physically. They are always dry and sore, I've been down all kinds of routes to hospitals, doctors, eye specialists etc and apparently I just need some lubricating eye drops. This has ""kind of"" solved the problem. My eyes have massive bags underneath, I sleep for 10 hours a day and drink plenty. I don't smoke or drink.The eyes are also quite baggy and red, and one is sometimes bigger than the other.I was just wondering if anyone can help me as this is really affecting me.."
Conjunctivitis,Had visual distrubances for 9 weeks.,"Hi, I just wondered if anyone is able to help me or advise? 9 weeks ago one evening my vision suddenly changed. It's very hard to describe what is happening but at first I thought it may be a migraine as I had flashing lights in my vision. Took migraine relief but it didn't go. It just never went away and I cannot see properly and it's very distressing. I've been to the opticians who said my eyes are fine. I've been referred to an opthamologist who also said my eyes are fine. My GP has run blood tests to check if I'm deficient in anything and checked for diabetes. All OK again. I was then referred to Neurologist who I've just come back from seeing and he is sending me for a scan but is 99.99% sure it will come back fine. That is good news but he has no idea what it is and suggested it was a visual phenomenon that will probably go away in its own time. Now I'm quite upset by that because my life has totally changed and I can't drive very far, I can't be out for very long because it's such a strain to see things that I'm exhausted. It's even very difficult to speak to someone and look at them because I can't see their whole face and it's so hard to concentrate on what they are saying. I'm driving mysef crazy with worry but just hope that maybe someone else has had similar symptoms and can give me some advice? I don't have any other health problems apart from a narrowing of two discs in my neck but neurologist says that wouldn't affect my vision. A few months ago I kept wakng in the night with numb hands and this lasted a few weeks but he said I must of been sleeping on my hands and dismissed it. What is going on ??"
Conjunctivitis, EYE SIGHT ,"I have only just noticed this morning that although I had a good night sleep. I am having focusing problems. It is like I am tired and having difficulty focusing on the basic text in order to read.My last eye test was in March and my retinopathy test was in June and both was excellent. I did have a new pair of prescription glasses which are great, but got up this morning fully refreshed and with no problems. Four hours later, my sight sight seems to be out of focus and a bit blurry.Has anyone else had this problem ?Any idea as to what it could be?what could be causing it ?What could I do?, as I know that it is the first time this has happened. It would seem silly to see a doctor/optician for a one off problem."
Conjunctivitis,"Night Blindness-like symptoms, are these curable?","I always didn't have the best eyesight; my right is at 0.4, while my left is 0.1 or lower. However, I have always made do with glasses, and I didn't notice any deterioration of my vision whatsoever.Recently, I've been noticing something that definitely wasn't there about a month ago; I can barely see in dark areas. For example; when stargazing, I used to be able to see the stars perfectly normally, but now I can barely see the brightest ones. When I look towards grounded objects, I can see their outlines silhuetted against dim light but I can't discern ones that don't have background light. When I'm ""night blinded"", I also seem to see something not unlike the distorted shapes moving around when you close your eyes, which blocks most of the light.Furthermore, I seem to have a black disk made up of those moving, slightly colored shapes blocking my intermediate vision. I can discern objects at the edge of my peripheral vision just like I used to, and I can see objects in about a 5 degree circle in the middle of my sight, but everything else is clouded with the shapes. However, the size of this disk is about the size of my glasses; perhaps this has something to do with wearing glasses for an extended period of time?I should add that I have absolutely no change in my vision strength at medium to high light, and I don't get ""blinded"" easily by dark to light transitions. Furthermore, even in dark areas I can see areas lit by streetlamps as usual, without the dark shapes blocking my way.What is this, and is this curable?"
Conjunctivitis,Dry mac continues even though wet mac (bleeding) has taken place,"After several days of very seeing a very blurry spot in my left eye, I saw the retinal specialist. Of course, the blurriness had disappeared by the time I saw him, but I learned something. He confimed what the tech had told me in that dry mac continues after diagnosis of wet mac. It does NOT go away. Loss of vision continues and in fact one's life is like a roller coaster with ups and downs. Seeing that black ball when getting up out of bed is from a drop in blood pressure. He acknowledged that I probably shouldn't drive as long as I felt nervous about it, but after some time had past and I felt more comfortable about driving to use my own judgement. I felt this was good advice as I've already noticed I have good driving days and days when I really don't see well enough to drive safely. I have only had one shot of Avastin in my eye and that was when two cysts were seen. I will not have another one until I have another bleed. Fine with me. "
Conjunctivitis,Optician diagnosis Occlusion left ,"I am 64 and about two weeks ago banged my forehead on wash basin in downstairs loo( as there's not much space), then maybe a few days later I noticed seeing black flashes and my eye was quite painful. so i made appt for eye test had to wait 2 weeks .my own fault as I hadn't mentioned it.The optician diagnosed an occlusion at back of left eye and faxed my GP and also informed hospital. The next day I made appt to see GP one I hadn't seen before and had to read up all my notes, I'd been taken off Atenanol for BP and tried others which didn't suit,also a water tablet which made me nauseus and breathless. so I haven't had any blood pressure meds for months.I've been taking my own readings at home. I brought them in and the previous night's was sky high,gp asked why I'd taken reading again!! I'M now on Amias 2mg.Can anyone give me advice please on what to expect? Thanks "
Conjunctivitis,Desparate need for better medications to treat Wet macular degeneration,"I am appalled at what medications are available to treat wet macular degeneration. I pay attention to side effects. They are real, as I have learned. I have had one shot of Avastin and am in the process of looking up more side effects. Blindness? Stroke? Why should I take a medication that could cause me to go completely blind when wet mac will only cause partial blindness? Do I want to go partially blind or suffer for the rest of my life with a stroke? I'm almost 79. Can't help but wonder if the lack of interest on researchers' part is because this is dealing with old people who are going to die anyway."
Conjunctivitis,Retinal artery occlusion,"Just been to the eye A&E, and told I have a branch retinal artery occlusion. This has taken me by surprise as the registrar explained it as an eye stroke! I thought I had vitreous detachment with the usual onset of the floaters and flashing lights! He didn't explain much, nor did he ask what I was experiencing. I have no loss of vision. Googling it doesn't help as my symptoms don't match the diagnosis! Anyone out there with similar?"
Conjunctivitis,"Red eye in my right eye, once every 3-4 months","Well my eyes been doing this on and off since 8th grade. I'm now a junior in high school and have this problem sometimes at school. My eye gets very red but it doesn't hurt and I can see fine out of it. I've been to some eye doctors and they were clueless on what was bothering my eye. So they gave me some eye drops and told me to use them when my eye is red. Every once in awhile my eyes will switch on redness. One day it will be my right then the day after red. I really want help and stop it. It gets pretty annoying when people say ""smoking too much weed?"" Or ""you got pink eye"". Anything would help"
Conjunctivitis,"Blurred vision for one year, how to diagnose the problem?","For about 12 months now my left eye has gone blurry, not so much that I can't see things but I'd say I lost about 30% of my focused eye sight during this 12 month period, I can see what is around me but not speficially, I can't read any text, CLOSE or FAR away from me, unless it's in front of my face such as my phone. (This is only my left eye). I went to an ophtalmologist and he checked everything and said I ""had"" some ""form"" of astigmatism and I needed glasses, he prescribed everything and when my glasses arrived a few days later I put them on and nothing, this was about 7 months ago, or more, I thought I should just wear them to see if my eyes would adjust but that just seemed ridiculous as my eyes shouldn't have to adjust to the lenses and after two weeks of wearing it without any affect I just left it aside and I never used it again. So two months ago, I got tired of my blurry vision and I went to another opthalmologist and said the prescription for my other glasses were wrong as one machine he used with a ballon inside gave the correct prescription while another gave the wrong one, so all in all I again received my glasses a few days later and yet again, no effect on my EYES whatsoever.Throughout this whole event I noticed that in the morning when I wake up I can see almost clearly with my left eye, but as the days go it gets blurrier and blurrier but never more than losing 30% of my focused sight. What is more strange is that if I simply take my finger and push the skin beside my eye inwards it makes my vision 100% clear meaning that I see perfectly, I tried touching my eye ball and pushing it VERY gently and slighly inwards just a tiny bit that you can barely notice and it also makes my eyes 100% clear meaning no blurry vision.. I don't want to keep going to new opthalmologists for this as they don't see to know what is up with my eye, it's a waste of money.. I was wondering if anybody could help me with this..I do use the computer a lot and I am not sure if that might have any problem with it, but if I focus my eyes too much on something close it bothers me such as making my eyes dry and not as clear.I am now taking VITAMIN A as I read that it helps with vision but so far nothing, I play sports and I fear of this because I need perfect vision and I don't know what to do.. I am in dire need of help. "
Conjunctivitis,Eye Problem,"Hey been diagnosed with mild dry eye and blepharitis, the itchyness and dryness isn't actually too bad, i was just wondering why my right eye all the time feels like there is pressure behind it, my vision in that eye is slightly out of focus compared to the left and i always get headaches around that eye, having said that my eye doctor says that my eye pressures are fine just a bit dry, any ideas? Thanks"
Conjunctivitis, EYES - Retinopathy ,"I am a diabetic, I have also been for retinopathy screening before many times. Now recently when I have been to the opticians for my usual eye check up, I have been told by the opticians to get my BP checked at every test that I have had done (BP is fine according to my GP). I have also been seeing spots which is getting worse and my vision takes longer to focus when I wake.With that in mind I have my retinopathy test tomorrow afternoon also an appointment with my GP...who do I tell? I ask this so I am not passed from pillar to post between GP and opticians."
Conjunctivitis,Advice On Pterygium,"Hello,I recently been diagnosed with Pterygium, I have been upset about this news. My GP wasn't too concerned and didn't give me much information on it. Didn't give me any treatment or tell me to see a eye doctor.So I have been searching on in the internet, only way to have surgery to remove it. Mine is small, yellowish blister on my eyeball just on the board line of the cornea. Not as red as such. I first noticed it in the summer, but it's went away without any treatment. I thought at first because I used too much make up wipes. It's came back a week ago, I think the make up removable wipes made my eyes watery and sore. I noticed It's came back.I'm at a lost end here, beside myself worry here. I have another appointment with a different doctor next week for another second opinion. I came around the idea I have got pterygium, I really like to have advice where to go? Surgery? Anyone had one removed? Came back? I really upset and I know it's not cancer, which it's comforting. Any advice, would be much appreciated. Thanks."
Conjunctivitis,Macular hole - do you have visual problems befoe the hole appears?,18 months ago I started getting blurry central vision in both eyes at the same time - it wasn't there all the time but when it was happening I found it very hard to do fine work.I saw an ophthalmologist who did an OCT and retinal exam and found nothing. He suggested it was neurological so I had an MRI of my brain and orbits but nothing was found to explain the problem.In the last three months I found that the problem had become permanent in my right eye - I could now see a faint central ring that pulsated with my heartbeat on that side. I went back to the ophthalmologist and he diagnosed a stage one macular hole. He didn't think the previous loss of vision was connected to this. He has advised me to wait and see if it gets worse but I am considering doing the surgery anyway - maybe trying the new drug Jetreap first which is very expensive but which is said to help a small number of patients.Has anybody had a similar experience - with the visual loss coming and going? Anybody tried or considered trying Jetreap?

I was then transferred to neuro who did MRI said I had arthritis in spine and could be causing the symptoms. I have joint pain, blurred vision, buzzing in feet and arms. I was at optician who have referred me to hospital as I have dry eye patches which she wants checked. I get down as I also have chest pains not that often thankfully its like chest contracting its agony. I have constant sores in my nose but my glands in neck are always sore so not sure if a bad head cold but is lasting far too long 6 months or more, I have had lumbar puncture which was clear because they did think possible MS.

Conjunctivitis,dry eyes and pseudoexfoliation,"I would love to hear from anyone with this condition. I have just had punctum plugs inserted in my tear ducts and two days later my eyes are just as sore as before.Apparently the condition was caused/made worse by diuretics prescribed for high BP. No one seems to be able to tell me if stopping the diuretic will reverse the dryness. I have been off it for eight weeks now and have noticed no difference. The consultant says that my loss of vision is down to the lack of a tear layer and apparently it makes cataract operations difficult too.i am using eye drops almost continuously and am so frustrated not being able to seedetails like knitting patterns, reading small print etc. Any help out there?Jenny"
Conjunctivitis,Vision problems,"HI, I am 52 and I have worn glasses since I was 17 and had regular tests and the last one in August which was normal. I have noticed that I seem to have a problem seeing in dim light even though other people seem to be OK. This is something that I have had a problem with for a long time but recently it seems a lot worse. And in the last few days my vision has gone slightly blurry when looking at anything close-up. Does anyone experience the same problems or does anyone know if this could be some kind of condition causing this or is just normal for my age?"
Conjunctivitis,Shimmering effect in 1 eye followed by nausea,Hi allHas anyone here had the effects shown in my question. If you close the affected eye (always the right eye in my case) you can still see the shimmering effect. I was told a while back that if you stare at a distant object then the shimmering will go away as quick as it arrived.That didn't work today and the effect lasted for over 10 mins and made me feel really nauseous. I took a couple of paracetamol/caffiene tablets and it went away eventually. The affected eye has been twitching for a few days before todays attack. When the attacks appear i also have balance problems.I don't know if any of the following might be attributal: Had a heavy fall on ice 4 years ago landing on my right shoulder and i am weaning myself off Fluoxetine (a drug used for my depression).I am loathe to go to the docs as i spend so much time there anyway for other problems.I don't like self diagnosis but the symptons seem very similar to Superior Oblique Myokymia.Any help would be gratefully received.
Conjunctivitis,Reoccurring Iritis Over 5 yrs,"i have suffered with non granulomatous Anterior Uveitis for about 5 yrs now. It occurs in either left or right eye but has not as yet occured in both at the same time. I have all the tests ie blood,chest xrays etc only to be told they dont know whats causing it. It is very annoying when it occurs as I have to make an appointment at the optician then he phones my doctor for the prescription for steroid drops and dilater. If its weekends I have to go to the hospital for this. Sometimes I go several months with no episodes then , like recently I have had 3 episodes in 6 wks ,right then left and now right again. It is very painful with severe headache and adversion to light, also painful to touch at the site of the redness. I wish I knew the cause but the doctors seem to give up on us poor souls that test negative to all their tests."

I have been to my doctor and he has referred me to someone but after two months I am still waiting for a letter of acknowlegement let alone an appointment. I find it a real bother.[i:628fc13ae6]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:628fc13ae6]
Conjunctivitis,Visual disturbance,"Hi, this is my first post on here and I'm hope someone can help with my problem, my GP has lost interest I think.I have had a daily headache for over a year, not all day but every day if yo know what I mean,GP has put me on Porpranolol which is helping. I do have side effects, one being that I fainted in the early hours when I got up to the loo, ( never fainted before in my life) I'm also getting a strange thing happen with my sight.When I go to walk and look down there seems like the floor has a big dent in it. and where ever I go to step the dent is there. This gradually goes away and usually lasts for about 30 mins.Can anyone shed any light on this.I've had my eyesight testwed and all is OK also had bloods done for temporal artritis and that was negative. the pain I have been getting all these months is always across my forehead or at the back of my eyes and nose. I sometimes get pins and needles in my right cheek too.Sorry this is so long but its difficult to explain properly."

My doctor was useless and I ended up going private to have it diagnosed.To make matters worse, my doctor told several people that I was a difficult person.I have lost all my self confidence and no longer work. My husband resents the fact that I don't work and he still has to. This makes me feel very guilty.I don't drive any more, as I find distances to difficult to judge, I'm just plain scared! If the sun is bright I find it more difficult.Sometimes when I am being driven I get very dizzy because of the speed of the traffic. I don't know why this happens, it feels as if I am going to pass out every time.Irritates my husband :-(The injections I have are the only thing that make this bearable, I feel like a freak.[i:8f08e04352]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:8f08e04352]"
Conjunctivitis,sports with a squint,"my son is 4 and the hospital told us he will never use his eyes together because of his squint. can anyone tell me how squints affect their ability to play fast moving sports such as football, squash etc.. We were thinking that if he only uses his eyes one at a time, then he wouldn't see someone approaching from the wrong side. PLus he wouldn't be able to judge when the ball was arriving. We are realling at present because we have been under hospital care for all 4 years and only now are they telling us he won't use both eyes. the suggestion is even if he has an operation to correct the squint, it will only be cosmetic. thanks for any help you can givesue"

I had it surgiacally removed by a plastic surgeon on the NHS ( after waiting 3years) and was delighted until it recurred after only 6 months or so. I had my second one removed when I was 34 just last year but I notice it is recurring again. The surgeon also tolm me I had one developing on my lower lid which was nice of him. After some reading I don't think I would have them surgically removed again and they seem to come back worse, especially after the second removal I have just read!I did read in homeopathy book that Calcerea 6c can sometimes work taken once a day for 2 weeks so I have just ordered some and am going to give it a try.If its a success I will let you know.[i:8d8845b79f]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:8d8845b79f]"

Recently they have got much worse, particularly the right eye. I am 64 years old and about 5 years ago I had a needle passed down the tear duct - it was not blocked and the symptoms continued. I have an underactive throid and take thyroxine but apparently this is probably not the cause. Although cold weather and wind makes the condition worse, my eyes water indoors, even on a warm day. I have tried artificial tears, at my homeopath's suggestion, and Medocromil, prescribed by my GP. Neither have helped. I would love to hear other suggestions.[i:1d6d3fd4c3]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:1d6d3fd4c3]"
