"Stroke & Tia","huge discomfort blow left rib","31/2 yrs ago I had a mild stroke. The morning after I felt a small discomfort on my left side just below my rib. The dr looked and felt but could see or feel nothing. Said it may just go away. Gradually the discomfort got worse and now is sometimes unbearable. It is always present and has indeed reduced my quality of life to a great degree.I have had CT scan, virtual colonoscopy, endoscopy, chest xray and ultrasound. All negative. I have seen a neurologist and 2 x gut consultants, again nothing.After all that NOBODY has the slightest idea what is wrong. (this is a time when everybody seems to give up on a patient!)The discomfort is just like as if someone is pushing their first firmy into the area immediately beneath my left lower rib and I tend to be automatically holding my hand, with some pressure on it, all day for somekind of relief.Is this a nerve or a gut problem, or anything else and perhaps npthing to do with my stroke after all?I now have to 'get out of my pram' to get any further tests done. Doctors switch off. Have you tried to push treacle through dry sand?!I am 67. Has anyone else suffered this problem please?James"
"Stroke & Tia","Just experienced a TIA at 35; feeling lost and confused","Hi, hope everyone here is starting out another wonderful day.  The best way to start is usually at the beginning so here goes.  Over a month ago, September 18th, I had sudden strange symptoms that came on with no warning.  It started with an immense tightness and pain in my chest, followed by dizziness and an inability to control thought and process.  after a while the pain dissipated but I was stilled plagued by the aftershock of symptoms that followed.  There was.no drooping of the face or limbs whatsoever, although I couldn't maintain steady thought process and my entire.personality seemed to have been changed.  Normally Im a very artistic and articulated person but that seemed to have vanished.  the awkwardness and fear has been overwhelming at times and although I have been to the ER and after an EKG, having a CT scan done, and been told that no swelling or bleeding could.be found in my brain, I have.not been the same.  I still continue to work full time, but I am not the same person I was.  At the moment, I'm still waiting for results from blood labs that my regular physician recommended and I have had no real change in my symptoms.  Many of the hobbies which mostly include passing guitar and music and reading I can't enjoy any longer because of the lasting effects.  I will admit that I blame myself largely.because I have not been a very healthy person and I take full responsibility for that obviously.  But I am not sure what to expect from here on out and am intensely afraid that it may happen again.  I dont really have anyone to turn to and I appreciate anyone that can.give me their insight on this.  I apologize for such a long.topic.  I greatly thank and appreciate anyone who can help answer even a few questions.  Have a wonderful day!üòÅ"
"Stroke & Tia","TIA...but no Meds?","hello...Numbness across left side of face...left part of upper lip felt like it was trying to move down & across to the other side...dizzyness & shakyness...then heart palpitations & shortness of breath.  Hospital said it was a TIA, but by the time they performed a CT Scan of my head the conditions were largely gone.  My scan results showed that my brain was fine, but they wanted to hold me over the weekend & do an MRI on Monday (at which point I checked myself out, promising to have one done on the outside).But...they never gave me a prescription for a blood thinner; & I read online that most TIA's are caused by clots; & that most people who experience them should be placed on blood thinners right away.  Is this true?Also...I still have a very slight numbness on the left side of my face, with a slight pain that occurs every now & then above my right ear.  Going to my primary today, to get a referral to neurologist...but am concerned that this could happen again; & am wondering why the hospital didn't put me on blood thinners.  In the past 2 years I have lost 50 lbs. & have been eating right & getting as much exercise as possible...so I'm wondering why this happened to me in the first place.thanx,mark4man"
"Stroke & Tia","Scared of stroke","I have had terrible health anxiety for the last year and just lately it has got to crisis point. From finding lumps to pains in my chest and now a tingling sensation and numbness in the left hand side of my face.I am scared I am going to have a stroke or brain aneurysm. The more I think about it, the worse the tingling gets....At my wits end. Constant stress about health and dying is literally killing me. I am nearly 50 and this is a dangerous age, which is just adding to the problem.Seriously need some help."
"Stroke & Tia","TIA or  migraine","Hi all,  Im a 63yr old generally fit lady.  I was driving to the gym when I noticed a w shape in my peripheral vision and I couldnt see the last letter of the numberplate of the car  in front of me  nor anything to the right of it.  All was well on the left side.  I had been lightheaded for a few days beforehand but otherwise well.  I saw an opthalmologist, nothing found, had blood tests, all well, CT scan and ultrasound of my arteries in my neck all good.  Im waiting for a 7 day ecg to check my heart.  My cholesterol and blood sugar levels are normal.  The only issue is my blood pressure had risen to 140/95  my normal is around 115/60  A stroke specialist told me it could be an occular tia or an occular migraine.  Ive been put on lifelong treatment for tia clopidogrel and a statin, since taking the clopidogrel I feel like Ive got flu and cant function.  I havent taken the statin yet as the doc said it was up to me if I want to try it as evidence for its usefullness is mixed.  Im shocked to end up on medication for life as a precaution and wonder if anyone else has had a similar experience of this or any experience of taking clopidogrel?"
"Stroke & Tia","Stroke, Tia or Hemiplegic Migraine?","Hi EveryoneI have been diagnosed with Hemiplegic migraines, and have been getting lots of Auras in the last month.  So havent felt right and am always tired.yesterday, I woke up in the afternoon, and I had tingling down rightside of my body.  my right arm was very shaky, so immediately took some Aspirin. The top of my right cheek was twitching too. Within half an hour of taking the Aspirin I went numb down rightside, My arm felt like it had that dead feeling and I had to keep shaking it.This morning I still felt not right, and blood pressure spiked to 158/109 so decided to go into hospital. my right side of my head didnt hurt just felt like pressure.  as I was getting ready I noticed my right eyebrow and eye was drooping so immediately called an ambulance, they said they were busy and to relax and only call them if I get worse.  I fell asleep and was woken up by 999 apologising for the delay, I noticed my numbness had worn off alot, and my eye had righted itself, so I cancelled the ambulance and called 111 for advice, was put through to a nurse and after the assessment she said that I needed to get to a and e within the hour.  i am so tired, i just went to bed and then my head started to hurt so have taken two aspirins.  i dont want to drive or spend 3 hrs in a and e to be sent home with no ct scan due to my hemi migraines. My bp is starting to go down, and I just want to sleep. I cant stop wondering if I have had a stroke, and would be interested in anyones thoughts on this."
"Stroke & Tia","Post Stroke Depression  ","I had my stroke 7 years ago followed by several TIA's / Episodes. I was discharged back to my GP after the last episode. There seems little he can do other than change or add things. However, he is very reluctant to give me anything for Depression/Anxiety. ( may cause problems with Warfarin  or Phenobarbital) . I've had  counselling but that's pretty ineffective. They listen..... but don't give any answers. They're not medically trained, so cannot comment.Finally I've been referred to a Psychiatrist, I see them next week. I'm really nervous about this, what exactly do they  do?"
"Stroke & Tia","TIA or something else? Please HELP","Hi, I'm 23 years old male. Suffering from breathing difficulties and other symptoms like head rush, pressure/pain in left side of the head. The most exhausting is breathing problem that comes and goes almost everyday, it's starts slowly and from an exclusive breathlessness that stays all day , i need to take very long deep breath every time, but this make the situation more worse.

No medicines seems to work. It is affecting my sleep and my performance."
"Stroke & Tia","Life after a TIA","Well, here's my story.16th January 2018, I had been having pins and needles in my right arm all day. I put this down to leaning on my desk and at work. Otherwise I felt fine.Drove home, shaking my right hand to get the feeling back (must have been leaning on the car door in a funny way.....)Made and ate dinner, still felt fine. Went to put my bowl away and dropped the spoon. For some reason I couldn't pick it up again. Dropped and broke the bowl. Went to throw the bowl away and felt ""odd"".¬† Wet to speak to my family and found I couldn't speak.That was terrifying. I had everything I wanted to say in my head but my mouth/voice wouldn't work. Dad went into ex-policeman mode and phoned 999. The operator talked him through some simple checks that I realised were the FACT checks for a stroke.Really scared now.My right arm was tingly and floppy. The paramedics arrived and I couldn't feel them putting the cannula into my arm (numb is good sometimes!!).Blue flashing lights and a rapid trip in an ambulance and I was in A&E. Hooked up to a load of machines and given strong aspirin. Admitted to the High Dependency unit. Following day I was told I had experienced a TIA. There was no evidence of a bleed in my brain (luckily).After a week in hospital, they found my left carotid artery was 70% blocked. so the following week I was readmitted to hospital for a carotid endarectomy.Woke up after the surgery with no pain. Again, numbness was my friend. The surgeon told me that when they opened the artery there was a large clot waiting to break off and get stuck somewhere. Luckily I got the operation in time to prevent this.After a week they took the staples out and I felt a little more normal.Now, 2 months after the ""event"" I am back at work. OK, I am working 50% from home as my energy levels are temperamental but I am getting back to normal. I am still scared this will happen again but as they have cleared the artery and put me on a pile of tablets (clopidogrel; Atorvastatin; aspirin; lansoprasole) it is unlikely to recur ( the rhs artery was clear).The only thing I do have to be careful of is that with this amount of anti-platelet medication I bruise like a ripe peach. I look a bit like I am being beaten up. Quite embarrassing for my hubby but if this is the worst I have to face then I can handle it. I have a future to look forward to (thanks to the NHS).L"
"Stroke & Tia","Left side stroke and heart attack together","Hello all, I really want to know your stories. Some time ago my dad, he's 55, suffered a stroke and a heart attack together. As it turned out, it all started in the heart, but somehow he didn't notice and went to his brain. Now 35% of his heart is damaged, there's a blood cloth left is his heart, but they're trying to get it out with medicine as other procedures are too risky due to his condition after stroke. He has trouble with his right hand and some of his face, but he can move everything, walk, he can't talk, only a few words, understands everything and can read and write a little. It's only been two days!All in all everything is like a miracle. Having in mind he suffered two life threatening events at once and can walk and think and understand is amazing.I was wondering, has anyone of you suffered something similar? Has your speech recovered?Thank you"
"Stroke & Tia","Stroke Story - what to expect?","Hello, I would like to explain the events that occurred about 1 week ago today & hopefully get some insights and comments!My Uncle, who is/was a healthy 59 year old male, woke up the next morning after being the MC of a wedding, after coming out of the shower, he sat down on a chair after feeling light headed before passing out.  He was able to regain consciousness and walk down to an ambulance that was called for him.12 hours later he was having brain surgery.As some background, he had been complaining of a headache that seemed to come and go for the last week, there was a sense this could be worse than your usual headache, but stubbornness and whatever got in the way and a doctors visit never eventuated.From what I could understand from the Stroke director and surgeon, the cause was a burst aneurysm, which was apparently a big one.  Somehow (i dont understand much from else from here) a clot formed.  WHen the aneurysm burst i dont understand either.But apparently when the surgeon when in to remove the blood clot they were unable to because it had hardened.  The clot had obviously formed a few days ago and travelled along until it couldnt go any further.But my uncle was admitted to hospital around 10am on Sunday morning but wasnt operated on until later Sunday night, so I guess my first question comes there, if it was a complete blockage wouldnt that warrant emergency surgery?  Would you be able to assume given surgery was put off til later that they wer able to get medication in there to reduce the blockage?Anyway,  so the surgeon had to improvise i suppose, given they were unable to remove the clot, so they cut off vessels surrounding the clot to force a rupture of the clot and that was successful.  THe blood was stopped here for roughly 5 minutes.  I guess that type of method would be  a last resort as who knows what type of damage and to how much of the brain that would have caused, but thats what needed to be done.   I assume only a neuro surgeon would have the right insights on this point, but if there are any of this forum, I would love to know and understand the medical science and methods behind that.So the surgery finished, in about 3 hours & he occupied the ICU for about 8 days.He was obviously heavily sedated until about day 4 or 5 and by day 6/7 he was opening his eyes and holding hands with family, but no talking and no movemnt at all on theright side.The right side of the brain was affected and the stroke director did comment that speech would be affected, but they were not sure by how much and that they were not sure how much impact there would be to the movement of his right side.The good news is that by day 8 he had been moved to the neuro ward, and out of the ICU.Today was day 9, and he seems to have come to some sense at this point, he recognises family, he has been crying and trying to talk, noises come out and you can see the frustration because he knows what he wants to say but just cant.So for the experts, what does that indicate so far? is this normal? Given that it seems he knows what he wants to say but cant, does he need to learn how to talk again?He understands what has happened and when the nurse writes things on a notepad, for eg. poke out your tongue or hold up your arm, he follows perfectly.It's such a shame that this can happen to a 59 year old, but thats life hey.Would love to see some insights and comments to help me understand a bit more.Thanks"

"Stroke & Tia","TIA? Blood Clot? Something else?","Hello. I'm a 66 year old female, diagnosed with CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) three years ago. I'm untreated, on ""watch and wait"", as my only symptoms have been my lymphocytes and white count.About 6 weeks ago, I noticed that I was having difficulty reading; it was hard to concentrate on the words, and it seeme as if the right side of the words were smudged or blurred. This scared me to death, so I looked in the mirror and did all the typical tests for stroke/TIA. There was no drooping, etc., but the right side of my face appeared blurred in the mirror. My husband took me to the hospital, where I stayed overnight and they did every test possible - CT, MRI, blood work, several neuro workups; nothing at all showed up.The doctor's best guess was that, due to my CLL, the viscosity of my blood might have caused a brief sluggishness and somehow kept blood/oxygen reaching the area of my optic nerve.  He put me on Plavix. My primary doctor sent me to a retina specialist; he found nothing wrong with my retina but believed that the problem was not ""viscosity"" but instead a tiny embolism.  My oncologist agreed, pointing out that cancer patients can be subject to blood clots, and I've stayed on the Plavix.Last night, I had another brief (a few minutes) similar spell; hard to concentrate on blurry words while reading. I didn't really notice the blurring while looking in the mirror, however. It seems to me that, just before I noticed the reading difficulty, I had a hard time enunciating a few words - again, vey brief. (In retrospect, I think this also happened very briefly the first time, though I attributed it to my fear.) I have a scheduled appointment tomorrow with my primary physician and will ask about this. I have been under pretty high stress this week over separate issues.Has anyone experienced anything like this? I wonder what it means that I'd have  the same odd symptoms (eye, possibly speech) twice. And, the second time, while on Plavix?Any and all opinions and experiences are welcomed!"
"Stroke & Tia","Mini stroke - vision","My 76 year old mother had sudden loss of half of her vision in one eye. It came on suddenly and she said it was like a line across her vision with the bottom half blurry. We went to the ER and she had a clear CT scan. The ER diagnosed her with a mini stroke and wanted to admit her. My mother is difficult and refused. She also had a mild headache afterwards. Has anyone had similar symptoms that either were or were not a TIA? Any advice is appreciated."
"Stroke & Tia","TIA or not","hi there 4 months ago I had been out clubbing with my husband and friends and family I hadn't had much to drink walked home fine needed to use bathroom walked upstairs fine come down a few minutes later with a headache  didn't think anything about it felt hot so went outside sat on the front step reached for my cigarettes in my back pocket and found myself falling backwards I managed to get my husbands attention but I was unresponsive and slurring my words my husband says I was saying my heart over and over again he was scared and phoned 999 paramedics came and I was taken to hospital I recall one of them saying looks like a TIA but at the hospital the nurse said I was just drunk I knew I was not as only had a couple of drinks, 4 months on I have been having heart palpitations and doctor not doing anything."
"Stroke & Tia","Mothers TIA in 1999, symptom relieved by draining pints of blood?","HiI dont know where to start really so going to just jump in.My mum had a TIA back in 1999. Her main symptom at the time was complete loss of balance.  MRI/CT? showed it to be a TIA. She was in hospital for almost 3 weeks.  She had hypertension since my birth after pre-epampsia (over 25+ years before this point)While she was there she was assessed as having ""too much blood"" and the decision was made to draw some to see if it would make any difference.  So minus 3 pints of blood over a few days, she was a lot better.  Weak, tired but her balance literally improved as the pints were removed.I cant ask her as she died in 2007 in short due to heart, lung and kidney failure.I am now facing a myraid of health difficulties myself so am trying to work out what might be relevant to me to seek full information in advance of my consultants appointments.Thanks for any help in advance"
"Stroke & Tia","Aftermath of a stroke","Hi everybodyIt's been a year and a half that I suffered a (fortunately mild) stroke in Paris, France, where I live. Fortunately there are no after effects physically. But the head continues to work sometimes badly. Sometimes, I am walking in the streets and I feel like if I was going to faint. It scares me a lot. I am seeing a psychiatrist which helps but not enough, at least that is what I think. I go to the doctor often for check-ups and nothing to be scared physically. I am going to see a neurologist in April for a brain check up.My question to readers, and eventually to doctors, is why this is happening? Why does my brain goes on scaring me? How could I do to stop having bad thoughts and being scared?If someone could give me some help I'd appreciate.Thank you for reading and eventually answering.All the best to all of you.Fay√ßal Benhassain"
"Stroke & Tia","Eye stroke? ","I've been out of the hospital (went in for blood clots in lungs) for a week and now I'm feeling something odd.  A day ago my forehead felt heavy, for lack of better word, and now my right eye feels like something is lodged in it, towards the back of my eye. The vision in my right eye has always been blurry but this feels different.  Could it be an eye stroke or some other eye problem?  I'm on blood thinners currently as well."

"Stroke & Tia","Was it possible i had TIA?","One night a few weeks ago while i was on video chat with my friends they had noticed i suddenly became very quiet when talking as though i was ""falling asleep"" i apparently became confused at words and unable to think and say everyday words it was then they noticed my right eye was ""slooping"" it had looked like my right side had all fallen down,they had started to panic and were tying to get ahold of my parents since i apparently wasnt fully aware of what was going on to yell for help myaelf but after about 10mins everything started becomming nornal again, i was still confused and my eye was still slightly more down then the other and it simply looked like my other side of my face was swollen compared to the rightside but since i was able to talk again and that i simply decided to go to sleep.The next day my parents and my pharmacist noticed the difference on the right side of my face and got me to phone and make an appointment with the doctor who then later on phoned me, i told him what happened and how my face wasnt still 100% normal but he decided because im only 23 that it was impossible i had a stroke or TIA and refused to check me over.Everything is back to normal and i havent had another episode of whatever had happened and when i was talking to a friend about it all they said it def sounded like a stroke even when i saw another health specialist they were appalled the doctor never saw me to check me over after what i had expirenced and now im wondering did i have a TIA or was the doctor correct in not seeing me because om apparently too young for such a thing?"

"Stroke & Tia","Share you TIA experience with me!  Is mine atypical like doctor says?","I'm female in early 30s. Good health. ¬†A few weeksI was standing in a shop, standing squarely, facing forward. Feet firmly planted. I had not just gotten up or anything. I had been looking at an object for a few minutes.Suddenly (and it all happened in about 15-30 seconds) my left leg started side stepping repeatedly, making my stance wider and wider. In those few seconds my brain literally thought ""why is my left leg stepping out to the side without me telling it to?"". Then I realized what was happening. My leg was not moving of its own accord. It was losing it's ability to hold me up and shuffling out as it was collapsing. ¬†I was sinking down into my left side. I think my leg possibly was trying to support me but it was like it was weak and I slumped over the side and was weak for a moment. Like that side couldn't hold me up. I never fully collapsed as after a few seconds I snapped out of it.¬†¬†I didn't feel like I was going to pass out. It was completely different. There was no darkness closing in around me. I was not fainting.¬†I've had that feeling once as a child. It was not this. It was like I didn't have command over my body for a moment and it was weak.Afterwards I was tired and legs felt heavy for an hour.Later I decided to go into the hospital and get checked. When he gave me normal routine exam, touch his fingers my nose etc I passed perfectly. They ruled out a stroke and the doctor was very adamant that it could be MS and said I would need to get a follow up.¬†¬†A week later I had an MRI of my spine and neck. Nothing.My two questions are:1)¬†My neurologist also said **you cannot have a TIA where your leg doens't fully collapse. He said if I had had a TIA, my leg would not have been able to hold me and I would have collapsed to the floor on that side. ¬†Is it possible to not collapse all the way? If felt like I was collapsing slowly, but then I snapped out of it and was able to stand again. ¬†He also said you can't hold a position like that parallel to the floor for a few seconds. I'm just not sure and wanted to see if anyone has had a TIA or stroke and had leg weakness and NOT collapsed. ¬†2)¬†He also implied you shouldn't be able to 'think' while having a stroke. I was able to think ""why is my leg moving without me telling it to"". ANyone else been able to have higher order thought during a stroke?Thanks so much. Just wanted a second option here. ¬†It was scary what happened and I'm trying to make sense of it.¬†Report this¬†0¬†"

We are at a loss as to where we go next as we havent had much advice from the medical professional on this either. Has anyone experienced this?

"Stroke & Tia","Clear MRI Scans","I had an episode a year last September and got discharged from A & E with suspected Migraine. I suspected that I had a TIA or Stroke. For 2 or 3 months no joy with the GP's and when I got to see a Neurologist 3 months later, listening to my symptoms and resulant damage he said he thought I had a stroke/TIA and ordered MRI Scans (some 4 months after episode). The Brain MRI and the MRI Scans of top 2 sections of my spine came back clear. He basically said that he did not know what it was and said if they cannot diagnose my symptoms they will treat them and prescribed PREGABALIN. My symptons are nerve pain, numbness, pins and needles over my right side from the chest down, exactly half of my body (therefore surely neurological).My main question is surely it is possible to have had a stroke/tia and the MRI scans come back clear, especially as the scans were over 4 months later. My feeling is as the tests came back clear, the Neurologist will not diagnose a stroke, however it doesnt mean I have not had one.The medication did not ease my right sided pain/numbness so my GP is referring me to the ""Area Neurologist"" whoever that may be, she said he is very thorough.If anyone could advise I would be really greatfull.Mike¬†"

He booked a mass of tests to find the cause of the raised eosinophils. It turned out it was a reaction to the antibiotics and once stopped the eosinophils began to decline and my new neurological symptoms stopped.¬†I was booked to have a head MRI as an in patient but the machine broke and I finally had the head scan as an outpatient the end of January.¬†Thank you if you‚Äôve stayed with me to now.¬†Fast forward to today.¬†Saw my own GP for the first time this year and in passing asked if I was correct in thinking the head scan was normal as I hadn‚Äôt heard anything?¬†Imagine my shock when he tells me there are several areas of ischemia.¬†So a referral has gone into the TIA clinic, I‚Äôm having a fasting cholesterol test tomorrow morning and he wants to start me on aspirin as soon as I‚Äôve had my surgery next week (it was cancelled as I was in hospital in Jan)My questions are:Has anyone else had TIAs due to/in combination with eosinophilia?¬†Would I be correct in thinking that each time I had a daily episode of leg weakness etc, that was a new TIA?¬†Is surgery safe if I haven‚Äôt been checked by any clinic or taken any preventative medications?Thank you so much in advance, i am still in the processing phase.¬†"

"Stroke & Tia","THESE MIMICS ARE NOT TIA, BUT WHAT?","My symptoms are always the same and have been going on for months; I feel a flushness in the right side of my face and my right foot feels heavy. Symptoms last less than a few minutes. Earlier this year I went to the hospital and over the next 24 hours was tested for pretty much everything. The diagnosis was that it was definitely not TIA.But what is it? The doctor suggested it might be a lack of electrolytes. I frequently drink a bottle of wine in the evening and always have a Monster beverage in the morning. Since my hospitalization I have daily taken a hydration multiplier yet my symptoms persist.I am a 67 year old Caucasian male in excellent health. With my diagnosis the doctor said ""whatever you are doing, continue doing it"". The only prescription drugs I take are an occasional Lorazepam and I rarely take Zolpidem. Occasionally at night I vape marijuana. All this helps me sleep.Once, and only once before I was hospitalized for the tests I tried to print and found that I could only print in a very small and infantile way. That scared me but that issue has never recurred. My speech has always been fine. When I have an attack I can still walk but my pace is very measured. Until yesterday I have not had any attacks. Yesterday I had 5 {by far a record}. Today I had none.Has anyone else has similar issues? Any thoughts?Has anyone else has any symptoms like this?¬†"

"Stroke & Tia"," 3Years after a mild stroke, i am experiencing TIA type symptoms daily? My consultants say its stress functional symptoms.Help me someone Please!!","3years ago I had a mild stroke, and since that day, ive been having TIA type attacks near daily. WHY? I need answers and help PLEASE.Hi my name is Dave.I am requiring any help feedback, as to whether anyone else seems to have or have had recurring stroke like symptoms, 3years after a small stroke. With the help of my wife and others, I have compiled this.8years ago, at the age of 39 yrs. I was a high flying energetic senior manager within a large uk-ftse. company, I had worked for many large UK corporations in a senior position very successfully, and also Director of my own businesses, when I suffered a large nervous breakdown.This was due to 20years 15hour day 6/7days a week workaholic lifestyle, in senior business management working for private and public companies.I suffered and am still suffering with hypertension, high cholesterol, and abnormal electrical QT wave diagnosed when I was 24years old. Due to constantly having heart pain, I underwent stress tests which I was unable to complete, after having an angiogram, it was then found that under stress, my heart arteries and blood vessels constrict severely causing me pain.All this eventually with my high work ethic, caused me to have a nervous breakdown, I then was unable to work and I fell into severe depression, all this was been treated with medication as belpw.Then 3years ago whilst having a nice stroll near the beach at Cleethorpes, with my wife, I experienced loss of feeling in my left leg for approx. 10minutes and then the same thing in the left arm. My wife and I laughed it off, wondering what was going off, I also felt unwell and dizzy so we decided to drive back home to Doncaster.My left side felt weak, so after having a couple of drinks we went to bed early.The next morning I was unable to wake up and get up properly, so my wife came upstairs and noticed that the left hand side of my mouth and eye had drooped on the left side of my face.I was very dizzy and unsteady and weak on my left leg and left arm, and I had this very severe pain behind my left eye socket, and my wife states that I was slurring and unsteady due to dizziness.Luckily my 24year old daughter who had just popped in mentioned to my wife, that this looked like a stroke, the paramedics who came out were shocked that on inspection I had not gone to the hospital for treatment the day before, they immediately took me into Doncaster Royal Infirmary for hospital treatment.I was treated for a stroke and subsequent CT, MRI scans and the consultant reports within the first 48hrs states as follows;‚Äò‚Äò This gentleman‚Äôs symptoms suggestive of ataxic hemiparesis, would be in keeping with a lacunar syndrome although the white matter changes in the MRI are more predominant in the left hemisphere than the right and I cannot identify any clear brain stem lesion on review on the PACS today.Undoubtedly there is some functional overlay component. This gentleman‚Äôs presentation is in keeping with his significant history of depression. His signs would be in keeping with a lacunar stroke and I note that carotid dopplers show carotid atheromatous disease in the asymptomatic artery, Therefore it is entirely reasonable for him to be on appropriate vascular preventative therapy. He is aware of persistent sensory deficit which is causing him anxiety.‚Äô‚ÄôI have been diagnosed as having cerebral vascular disease, hypertension, angina, diabetes type2, reflux, glaucoma, asthma, depression.I am on medication for my above health issues as follows, Clopidogrel 75mg, Amlodopine 10mg, Montelukast 10mg, Atorvastatin 40mg, Irbesartan 300mg, Bendroflumethaizide 2.5mg, Pregabalin 600mg, Metformin 500mg, Isosorbide Mononitrate 60mg, Lansoprazole 30mg. Salbutamol and Seretide inhalers. Glyceryl Nitrate GTN spray for angina. Cocodamol and Paracetamol for pain management.However from the moment I had this mild stroke I have been getting recurring stroke like symptoms, for now 3years after.Initially my left leg had a small shake uncontrollably, however since being prescribed Pregabalin in the 1stsix months, I have not hardly had a recurrence, just slight shakes now and then.These episodic attacks are now as frequent as three times a day and sometimes 7days a week, where I suffer episodes of stroke type symptoms, during my sleep, and twice during the day.These attacks which can be from light to severe attacks are as follows, a light attack feels like an electrical current going through my head and dizziness, and then a bad attack sometimes precedes with a tingling numb-like feeling in left-hand side of my face, which then ends with me displaying the symptoms as already described on numerous occasions and literally ends with me sleeping heavily, and my leg and arm feels like a lead weight, these have been seen by many medical professionals within Royal Hallamshire Sheffield Hospital, Doncaster Hospital, the nurses at the local GP and local CMHT.A heavy attack has the following symptoms, dizziness, pain in my head, a drooped mouth and left eye and left hand-side face, weakness in left arm and left leg, unable to walk, slurred speech, tingling in the left-hand side of face, blurry vision. These attacks whether light, medium or heavy, always ends up with myself being completely fatigued, confused with dizziness and then my brain forces me to sleep, from 2 to 4 hrs. or so.These attacks happen during my sleep, as my wife is unable to wake me up in the morning and when i do finally wake up, i have the tell-tale left sided face droop etc, they can happen anytime of the day, whilst I am sat watching tv etc. sometimes 2 to 3 times a day for up-to 7days. My memory is terrible, i am unable to concentrate for long periods, i also lose my balance a lot, and I sometimes have a very severe pain, behind my left eye socket, and this does not go away with painkillers.However after an attack, my limbs are weak for a day after.Once i have recovered ie woken up after a sleep from 2 to 4hrs, i feels sometimes like I am drunk and very hung-over for a day or two, I am completely washed out, with varying pains, headaches and i am unable to walk once these attacks happen and i am very weak on my left side leg and arm daily and on-going.I get dizzy spells during an attack and also when im not having an attack.Also I am slurring, or mumbling during an attack, my speech is clear when I am not suffering attacks however my wife and children have stated that sometimes i say the wrong words or whilst speaking sometimes put the wrong words that im trying to say, in the wrong part of a sentence, which they find amusing, and i find frustrating and angry with myself for doing that, but i do not have slurred speech outside an attack unless I am tired..My vision has deteriorated since the stroke, and my left eyesight is terrible, i have just been diagnosed with glaucoma and diabetes and early stages of diabetic retinopathy, however the medics are looking into my eyesight issues but with no joy.I have also been experiencing in addition to the other symptoms, pain in my bones on my left side and back, especially when i retires to bed at night, to the point where we have had to obtain a loan to purchase, a ¬£3000 hospital type adjustable bed, which has not really alleviated the pain.I am under a psychiatrist for depression, but nothing seems to be working for me, I am on medication, I have been tried on different medication over the 8years and im currently on 40mg of fluoxetine a day. My depression seems deeper since the stroke and i am struggling daily.Im under a neurologists at Sheffield Royal, but they have put it down to functional symptoms due to stress, I have been recommended for psychotherapy, but will not be allowed down this road until my depression stabilises, we need help or any information from stroke survivors, have you suffered anything like this...I feel like im a pain to the medical profession, and as a previous troubleshooter in management and business, in working as a consultant in performance and productive environments and with working knowledge of performance measures within the national health service, i feel I am a problem to performance and productivity figures as i am still on the consultants caseload. However these are just my feelings, and does not reflect on anyone‚Äôs professional expertise.My local GP, is understanding and very GOOD at helping me emotionally and with medication to control my symptoms.Ive been tested for bells palsy, ms, but no joy, does anyone have these effects or symptoms after 3 yrs after a stroke?I have never ever regained the strength in my left leg or arm, this was only a small stroke, due to clotting from furred up carotid artery the consultants have informed me.I am constantly in turmoil over this, feeling very depressed and even suicidal on a daily basis, My stroke was not a bleed, it was a mild stroke, possibly caused by a clot from the diagnosed furred up carotid artery in my neck. I just need some answers or other experiences and how they have coped or resolved. My grown up children, aged 30, 24 and 21 and myself and wife are getting exceedingly worried, as I am having more of these episodes especially over the last 8-10months.This is affecting my whole family too, in a depressive way.I need help and answers and im praying for answers, please help someone, all this makes me feel very suicidal.Doing this email is very hard mentally as i am constantly drained, it has taken me 3 weeks on and off to try and compile this email with the help of my wife and others. ThanksKind RegardsDave and Nicola"
"Stroke & Tia","Old Bleed and mini strokes","Hi, just looking for a bit of advice as getting information from the hospital is proving very difficult. They simply don't seem to know.My Dad collapsed and was rushed into hospital weeks ago. Doctors have said he has an old bleed on the brain which has caused the problem. He was always active and showed no signs prior to the collapse but since he has lost the ability to talk. He can make sounds and looks as though he is making conversation but can not string any words together that make that we can understand.¬†He has developed chest infections and has got pneumonia which they have said is delaying scans that they need to do to ascertain what is wrong. He has allegedly subsequently had a series of mini strokes and is much worse now. They have said he is going to be moved to a Neurosurgery ward so they can assess him further. They have mentioned quality of life, whilst other doctors are still saying they don't know whats wrong so can say whats happening yet. Has anyone anything they can add that can help understand the current situation. I'm hoping the quality of life was just to say if he will be able to be independent and assess level of recovery rather than anything terminal. They could make things clearer rather than using such terms.Sorry for war and peace Does anyone have any recommendations on what we should be asking the doctors as this is completely new territory for me.Thanks in advance"

"Stroke & Tia","Just returned to work, almost 2 years after a stroke. Having some difficulties and new symptoms ","I had a left brain stroke in Feb 2016. I have worked very hard to rehab and didn't let my job push me into coming back before I felt I was ready. As a result I was terminated 3 months after the stroke. I continued to work on recovery. When I felt I was ready I began seeking employment elsewhere (partly because I couldn't go back to working 70 to 75 hrs a week, let alone the 52 they expected and also I felt very let down that after all my hard work on their behalf not only did they fire me but they never even came to check on me or call or anything.) I even tried moving to a different state to seek employment but it seemed no one wants to hire a stroke survivor. (BTW you can't even tell at this point that I had the stroke by watching my movements) I do fatigue more easily but this i've been told is to be expected. I just returned to work (unfortunately for the same company) but part time and starting at the bottom again) My 4th day working, I was placed on second shift working 91/2 to 10 hour shifts. The next day I began experiencing tingling and numbness ""flowing"" into my tongue, throat, and the right side of my face. I know that over time nerves coming back alive and ""spurt fireups"" have been part of the recovery but this feels different. Is anyone else experiencing this. I don't have insurance ( I had it when I had the stroke and they paid for nothing anyway) I take 4 baby asprin whenever this happens and it seems to help but I don't know if I should be going to the hospital or if I'm just working myself into a state of worry over normal recovery things. I would love to hear from other stroke survivors to see if anyone else has experienced anything like this. I can't get long term disability because I was a stay at home mom for alot of years and went back to work as a contractor with the post office so I don't have enough time in for ssi disablility and the company is only paying me 8.50 an hour now. I dont know what to do, help please, I don't want to be a burden to my family.A"

"Stroke & Tia","Tia/migraine?","On 6th December my 71 year old husband had a suspected Tia symptoms were head ache shimmering in corner of right eye described by him as like looking through water plus slurred speech which lasted a few mins.  I was talking to him and  afterwards he said he knew what he wanted to say but could nor find the right words.  He went to A and Rand was seen by the doctor.  Blood tests were fine except for high triglycerides.  Examination was normal. It was diagnosed as possible Tia.  2 days later he saw  the consultant  after having a Doppler scan on the neck this was ok and after asking lots of questions the doctor said he thought it was a migraine even though he had  never had one in his life.   At the a and e he was put on 300mcg aspirin.  The consultant t old him to stop.  About a week after that . He had  an mr i brain scan together with an ear scan which had a already been booked for other reasons.  He was told not t o drive for a month and he would see him in clinic 6/8 weeks.  His appointment is 19th Jan. The consultant said he would be very surprised if the mr i showed anything.  He has a copy of the letter to the gp saying it was thought to be a migraine not a Tia.  Does all this sound ok.  He has type 2 diabetes asthma/copd arthritis and is overweight.  He had not had any other  episodes and was completely back to normal before arriving at a and e.  I would add our son aged45 had a possible Tia 2 years ago but this was because he had let his diabetes go out of  control. He has been type 1 diabetic since he was 2.  I assume they took this Into account. The other thing is he is wanting to start driving again as I don't drive.  One month will be 6Jan but 4 weeks to the day will be the 3rd of Jan.  Do you this will matter if drives on the third.  Thanks."
"Stroke & Tia","TIA / Mini Stroke experience","Hello everyone  I am a 22 year old female and believe I may have has a TIA (Mini stroke)¬†On wednesday evening I got home and looked in the mirror the take my makeup off and noticed my vision was slightly strange in my right eye as I couldnt see part of the right hand side of my face, I then looked down at my phone and again I couldn't see the buttons on the right side or my right hand. I was alone and had a bit of a panic attack as my vision is normally perfect /no glasses no contacts or anything.¬†I called the NHS helpline and the lady on the phone was lovely and told me to get to a hospital within the next hour, she rang through to them so they were expecting me. Whilst on the phone my boyfriend arrived home so we got straight in the car and drove to the hospital. i tried putting the hospital postcode in the sat nav but kept getting the number mixed up no matter how many times i had memorised them, In the car i then felt extremely spaced out and had a strange sensation in my head, pain like a headache but different, I then lost feeling in my right hand and it went all pins and needles and numb. I then had a couple blood tests once at the hospital and whilst waiting my boyfriend was talking to me about my day / favourite tv shows etc and I couldn't answer any of his easy questions, it was like I knew the answers but the more I tried to find them in my mind the more blank it went and then i'd get upset.¬†The hospital kept me in and after exams i was finally in the hospital bed at 4:30am , The doctor woke me up at 6:30 to run through the plan of action with me, my CT scan had come up normal, however he is treating me for a stroke, and gave me aspirin to thin my blood. He then said he is arranging a couple of eye exams due to the vision loss and also he wants to get an MRI booked in asap.¬†They didn't let me go home the next night either. My blood pressure was very low almost every check. I had lots of eye exams and then kept asking if i could go home, the doctor said I should stay in as the tests will all get done quicker however if i really don't want to stay I can go home and have everything done as an out patient but if i feel strange still I need to come back asap.¬†So I am now home after three days in hospital. I have to see my GP on monday and am currectly awaiting an OCT eye test, an FFA eye test (friday) and an MRI, I feel generally pretty weak and spaced out and a bit worried about the thought that it is very likely to have been a TIA.¬†Any thoughts?x¬†"

He didn't react that well to the surgery, reporting the usual discomfort and some pain in the first weeks. Then he started getting apathic, low appetite, and had full conscious that he wasn't that well, but still didn't seem to care about it when we asked how he was feeling.About a month ago, we took him to his MD, who prescribed escilatopram, because he seemed ""depressed"".Then the nightmare began. In the first/second day, hallucinations, mental confusion, couldn't recognize anyone or where he was (at his own home), couldn't even speak or formulate a thought. We stopped the antidepressant usage but it was too late. By the third day¬†he had a huge hyperglycemia crisis, where the glucose level reached almost 500 mg/dL. We had to inject rapid acting insulin to bring the glucose to regular levels, because his long-acting insulin couldn't to the job, and it's been like that ever since.¬†Can't eat a single bread, single potato, or the glucose level shoots up.The doctors said he could've had a stroke, kidney disease and even prostate cancer. Though, they can't even do a CT scan or MRI because of the pacemaker implant.He now looks like he's dying and it gets me deeply sad and angered because we can't get any answers on how to try to treat a person so dear to us, who was in full conscious a few weeks ago and now looks like he's about to die.Can I get a few insight from you here? Some similar case/experience?Thanks in advance"

"Stroke & Tia","Is it possible to start feeling depressed two years after a stroke?","My dad had a brain stem stroke two years ago. The first six months were the most difficult since he needed help all the time. After that he started driving and working normally and he was feeling good overall. When the stroke happened we also discovered that he had diabetes and high blood pressure. Because of that he takes a lot of pills. One year after the stroke we started to notice that he wasn't as happy as he used to be. Since he didn't even consider the possibility of going to a therapist his neurologist prescribed him Lexapro. I think it helped but now, two years after the stroke, I think he is depressed. He says that his legs hurt sometimes and often says that he doesn't feel like doing the things he used to love and he prefers staying home that going out. He is only 57 and I don't know what to do. I try to cheer him up but sometimes it's very hard to do so and I get very frustrated. I've noticed that his blood pressure is very low sometimes, like 10/6. Maybe that's the reason why he feels like sitting/lying down all the time? Can anybody help me?Thanks,Concerned daughter"
"Stroke & Tia","TIA - Amaurosis fugax?","Hello. I know you're not medical professionals, I'm just looking for a little reassurance if anyone can oblige? I have spent the last few days rigid with fear and I'm too scared to be left alone through fear of having a stroke and I'm scared of eating the wrong thing..I was diagnosed 5 days ago by both GP and neuro consultant, as having a tia and have been prescribed 75 mg aspirin and 20 mg statins and told not to drive for a month as I'm at risk of a stroke.My day started as usual.. I was sat on my kitchen worktop talking to my hubby, I jumped down off the worktop to follow hubby outside, as I put my head up I was aware that something was wrong with my vision in my left eye, I followed my hubby outside and told him I couldn't see properly, looking straight ahead everything below my sightline was black yet I could see clearly above sightline, my eyesight was literally split in two, but just the left eye. I stood still for a minute and hubby then guided me to sit down, where my sight just went back to normal within 10 seconds. I had no other symptoms and no pain anywhere. The whole episode from start to finish lasted 2/3 minutes.So, I suppose I'm looking for reasons.. I'm 47 years, Im a casual smoker and I know this can be a cause, but would this show up in an MRI? I have not touched one since and never likely to again! I'm 8 stone so no weight problem. I've had some tests at my local stroke assessment unit which all appear fairly normal? BP 123/82. Pulse 62. ECG normal. Angiogram/MRI normal. Bloods showed cholesterol at 5.6, but GP doesn't find that overly worrying? (I don't know anything about cholesterol). All other bloods normal, not diabetic either.¬†I do suffer from anxiety and at mo it really is off the scale so please don't put anymore fear in me üò© At the time neuro tried to reassure me that my age, weight, not diabetic, BP good etc, puts me at even less risk, but for me all I'm hearing is that I'm at enough risk to warrant meds and driving ban for a month like any other person who has experienced a tia. Honestly my head is really spinning, am I being stupid, overly anxious?thanks in advance üòä"
"Stroke & Tia","Aged 22 just had an event speculated to be a stroke ( blindness, vertigo, numb left hand)","Hello, I'm writing here as I am waiting to see a neurologist in the next couple of weeks. I'm sorry if I added this in the wrong column. There's so much to say about what I'm dealing with, that I didn't know what category to fit it into.¬†To start with, I've had a very bad history of mental health issues ( I know, weird thing to start with), and also a very bad history of how it was treated. I had a lot of anxiety in my first year at university, due to some personal and other problems, and I had to take a year leave. In my second year, my situation fluctuated between going ¬†well to going terribly bad. I berely finished what I had due from year one. In year two, I had even worst problems and I barely pulled through. Now in my final year, I am yet still experiencing problems, but in my last year they've been more physical than mental. For anybody unwilling to read most of my struggles with mental health, I've fast forwarded to the speculations on stroke in the last two paragraphs.My mental health degraded as the years passed. Initially, despite knowing me for being a fairly timid and emotional character, I began having bouts of anxiety. They got worse with some financial problems, both my parents getting ill (thereby being unable to work for a year, hence more financial problems), having discovered something from the past within my family that was linked to a very traumatic event in my childhood. To not digress too much, I didn't grow up with my parents for many years, as they left to work abroad, and I was passed on from one family member to another. I always felt unwanted by my parents, ""a burden"" to everybody who had to take responsibility for me, and it didn't help that I also suffered being perpetually abused in my last childhood years. ¬†My parents returned from abroad when I was 15 (they left when I was 7, and in this window we had short visits, about two a year). By this point I was planning to go to medical school; I was studying really hard, got top grades, and my teachers were very hopeful and encouraging that this was the right path for me. My parents, upon returning, were in high disagreement over this. They saw medical school as a time consuming, and -most importantly to them- very costly to take, and also the salaries upon graduation were not promising. They instead forced me to take mathematics and programming for my high school options, thinking this is the future, and i could get a very high paying job when I graduate. In this, I was mediocre, since I was never even passioned of such disciplines, let alone be anything good. I finished high school with Bs in ll my subjects, which affected my confidence a lot. To put it into perspective, in my school years I only had A*s in everything. I thought I was being robbed of my ambition, and not feeling I had any special qualities in myself I didn't know what to take for a degree. I chose a humanities degree, which exhausted me mentally. Here I was yet again mediocre, nothing special. Never had a passion in what I took, other than having it been a favourite past-time but I just wasn't too bad to be kicked out (yet) either. Ironically, I have even worst employment prospects in the degree I have ended up doing. I felt my life was pointless, and seeing people I tutored outside highschool in anatomy progress in medical school really took its toll on me.¬†My first suicide attempt was last year, I was put on sertraline for some months (which absolutely wrecked me, I became so apathetic I almost starved myself to death). Then floxetine gave me hallucinations, and I had to be taken off it after an incident. I completely lost any idea of myself and I passed out in a lab room for 10 hours. I was only found when they were closing the lab, my partner thought I killed myself, since I did not answer my phone all that time. After sertraline increased my suicide tendencies and starved me of any will to live (as an organism, let alone as a human being- I didn't leave a specific corner of my bedroom for two weeks, in which I had very little water and cose to no food at all) and fluoxetine made me into a walking lunatic, I refused to be put on any antidepressant anymore. Counselling and CBT didn't help, I decided it was a battle I had to fight on my own, and I was lucky to have a loving partner to stand by me in the process. It didn't help that in my third year at university (second, in terms of degree) I had pneumonia that left me bed ridden for months. This summer unfortunately, I had another critical point, where my partner had to call an ambulance. I became completely apathetic, and I just wanted to die. I started my last year with the hope that I can finally live a normal life again and work on my future, when I got terribly sick, I couldn't see anyone for a long time, I was constantly in pain, and my energy was fully drained. Both my mental and physical energy was worn off. I decided, I was a walking waste and I wanted to end it that time. The ambulance doctors wanted to refer me to the crisis team, took me to a bigger hospital in a different city, suggesting it is best for me to stay there for at least a night. It was so crowded and so full, my partner and I were left waiting for hours- him, crying... me, too apathetic to care unfortunately. I had a very dull discussion with a nurse ( I don't even think she was from the crisis team), and we agreed that psychotherapy might be the best option to be followed, saying that she will begin the process for me. This happened at the end of July. I never got a call back, or anything even now. Knowing how all of this damaged my partner as well, and our relationship, we agreed to fight it together, yet again. I resigned from my stressful summer job, which probably also made things worse ( I was in a financial impasse), and decided to focus on my mental and physical wellbeing, so that in turn I can be a better person too.A month after, my grandmother (who technically raised me like a mother in my childhood) suddenly began to feel very poorly. In that time I had to submit some outstanding work at university again. The doctor suspected stomach cancer, and said he wouldn't operate after what he saw in the endoscopy. My grandmother also suffered from depression, she was very sad...always crying. She had her life struggles as well, which I won't get into. It broke my heart whenever I called her, she would always cry . She didn't even know she was so sick. My mum didn't tell her she had cancer, she and my uncle hoped there was still a chance. My partner and were frantically trying to find time to fly abroad and see her. Plane tickets were so expensive, we settled for the 12th of September (after my assignment was also due). My last phonecall with her was in on the first of September. She said she was feeling very poorly, her legs were swollen, she could not eat anything. She said she was very weak, but she didn't want to die. Oh, God. I can hear her voice still. She was saying she was afraid to die. She died on the 2nd of September, a horrible, painful death. This time, I had become so bad, my mental health was the least of my concerns. I broke down physically. I cried out of everything, to the point that I would collapse. Anything that reminded me of her, made me fall down and cry, uncontrollably. Knowing she was dead, I began having a very strong smell of rot whenever I approached anything. I was so shattered, had hallucinations, and my heart was going crazy. One day all of a sudden -though I was feeling better-, my legs began to wobble uncontrollably, and my heart rate rose to 190 bpm, then it went horribly down. I began to have tremors, my vision was getting very hazy. At A&E I was dismissed with a panick attack. Back in the summer, out of nowhere, when I was just feeling a bit better,but I had terrible migraines almost every day. I thought it was just due to stress, anxiety, depression, etc. ¬†and at one time when I was washing the dishes I lost my eyesight completely for about 20 seconds. Last Wednesday, I woke up and I was very dizzy. I came from my lectures and I went outside with my boyfriend for a bit. I was feeling more dizzy, and I lost my eyesight again, this time for almost a minute. I stood still, I couldn't feel any part of my body, I thought I had fallen but didn't even know. I couldn't see, and I had no conception of balance. I told my parnter we had to go home. After a couple of minutes, on my way back, it happened again. Lost my eyesight, there was a lot of pressure in my head, and ringing in my ears. All I saw was white. When my eyesight came back again, I don't remember much aside from feeling obnoxiously dizzy and going to sleep. My boyfriend got terribly worried, he said I didn't make any sense in anything that I was saying when he brought me home and put me in bed. Fast-forward to Monday, in the morning we were talking, and without touching my arm in any way, it felt like someone aggressively grabbed my left arm. I began feeling a weird pressure in my wrist, but throught it was nothing. I tried to move my wrist and my arm, thinking I just got a pinched nerve or something. Then it got worse, it went down to my fingers, and ¬†then up to my shoulder. It felt like there was a string in my arm that was very painful, and all I felt was pain and pressure in my hand, with very uncomfortable pins and needles in my fingers. I tried laying down, but it felt like someone was then pulling me by the neck. My partner called 111, and since my simptons only worsened we went to A&E again. My resting heart rate was at this time 190bpm. The doctors at A& E didn't know if it was a stroke or not, they said all that I experienced could be speculated to be a stroke (or a TIA more likely, since my symptoms reverted the next day). They told me to go to my GP and seek to be referred to a specialist. He did refer me to a neurologist, and told me to just play the waiting game now, record any similar incident if it happens, and come back to the GP if I have another incident again.¬†¬†I am so sorry for how much I wrote, I digressed so much, I just don't know what is wrong with me. I haven't had a day since June when I didn't stress out or cry in the night, and I am worried all of this is now having other adverse effects. Not kidding, in my last week when these two events happened, I was actually working again on getting my life together. Pursuing a healthy lifestyle, walking in nature, and I had close to no stress. I was beginning to record things in my diary on a daily basis, trying to fight depression and anxiety. When this happened, I was just recovering from grieving my grandmother. Now I am again stressed, not knowing what just happened to me. Since Monday's incident, I also have pain in my chest, and I cannot breathe fully. I'm having dry coughs and I can feel them echoe down my chest. My resting heart rate was still in the 120s average until today, when it's gotten down to a normal 73.¬†I wrote so much, I even forgot to add another thing. Since this summer, particularly after my first bout when I loss my vision momentarily. I have terrible problems with my memory and cognition, hence why I chose Lethe as a username (the river of forgetfulness). I'm really sorry for writing this here, if I annoyed anyone. I just don't know what to do anymore.¬†¬†"
"Stroke & Tia","I had some sort of a stroke?","On Oct. 31. I was getting to bed around 4am (I work 2nd shift) and I was feeling stressed that night because I couldn't get to sleep. I fell asleep around 4:20am and I remember dreaming when suddenly I had sharp heart pains and my left arm/armpit had a numb tingle feeling. I woke up a freaked out and my chest pains and numbess were still there. Once I calmed down the chest pains went away, but I had a shortness of breath. I ended up getting 3 hours of sleep and throughout the day either my left arm or my neck and chin have a light numbness.

Had urine infection during the 4 weeks which wasnt treated and had a catheter.Anyway managed to get him home and immediately i stopped the amlodipine and citalopram but was pressurised into giving him the citalpram again but for some reason didnt know id taken him off the amlodopine..i monitored his blood pressure next 2 weeks and it was normal.He rapidly improved when they took him off the citalpram and treated his urine infection with an antibiotic called macrodantin although he now has a cough which i'm worried about because it says side effects of macrodantin  cause this and should be stopped  due to damage to lungs although his urine appears clear now.The district nurse says he will probably be put on statins and citalopram again...but i guess over my dead body...no way!"

"Stroke & Tia","TIA (Mini Stroke) or Migraine... can anyone help? ","Hi,¬†I have had migraines since I was a teenager, no aura, just the severe pain in the eye(s).On Sunday (this week), I was resting on the bed for about 20 minutes and when I got up, I was very dizzy (which¬†had been happening days prior) but I suddenly lost the feeling in my right leg and foot. It was difficult to walk, so I went to the hospital, blood pressure was 149/120.

"Stroke & Tia","Urgent Question about TIA","Hello, I'm 19 years old without any particular known health issues aside from GERD. My main risk factor would be inactivity as I work as a computer programmer and don't get a whole lot of exercise. No family history, nothing like that in particular, but...¬†last night, I woke up around 6 AM with a bit of pins and needles sensations on the tip of my right hand fingers and just on my cheekbones. My immediate thought was ischemic stroke(lacunar in nature) and I started reading an excerpt to see if I wasn't able to understand any of it. I could read it fine aside from feeling rather drowsy since I woke up at 6AM. I did a variety of self tests such as raising both arms in bed(at 6 AM, yes) and standing up and walking around. Of course, I was slightly panicking(oh hell, I was panicking hardcore) and I'm seriously wondering if I should take a trip to the ER for this. The pins and needles lasted around 1-2 minutes and shortly disappeared(with no other symptoms aside from the pins and needles), but it was enough to alarm me. Google so kindly informed me that I'll probably have a massive stroke fairly soon, and that got me in the typical terror dooms-day mode.¬†It felt like that pins and needles was specifically localized in my cheek(not whole side of face) and finger tips. I'm not sure if it was a mild stroke or my blood circulation acting up. It wasn't at all severe and I haven't had any changes in vision or whatnot, but I'm wondering if this is a cause for serious concern. I didn't experience any pain and the event has yet to recur.¬†I'm still slightly shaking from fear though... I love my folks to death and it's my worst nightmare to have them worry about their only son. I've had blood tests, urine tests, EKGs, Holters, ultrasounds and everything to rule out anything unusual, but nothing was caught. This would be a stroke without any real known cause aside from inactivity. I don't smoke or drink and eat a healthy balance of foods. I have an appointment in about a week for another full check up, but I'm wondering if this requires IMMEDIATE attention or is something mild enough to wait. I don't think I would have been concerned as much if it was just my hand, but it happened with my cheek, so it may very well have been a very very mild stroke. Or perhaps it was me sleeping uncomfortably in the upright position leaning on a couple pillows.

"Stroke & Tia","Misdiagnosed a TIA","I'm looking for some advice, I am a 35 year old female and in august 2015 I had an episode where I lost my speech and had numbness down my left arm and in my face lasting a couple of minutes. The day after I went to my GP who referred me to the TIA clinic. I had all the relevant tests ( MRI brain, carotid Doppler and bloods) and was told I had a TIA and was put on clopidogrel and blood pressure medication. All was well until march 2017 where I had another episode where I lost my speech and had only half vision in one eye, went to my GP and was again referred to the TIA clinic where I went through all the tests again to be told again I had another TIA and my carotid arteries are slightly narrow but not enough to restrict blood flow,my blood pressure medication was changed as it was still really high and I was put on atorvastatin.On the 9th June I was at the hospital for a cardiac stress test, as I left I didn't feel well, but I couldn't put my finger on it. I went in to work where I had another episode of left handed weakness and speech problems. Went back to my GP who again referred me to TIA clinic, this time I went I saw a different doctor who said I've never had a TIA and to come off the medication and said they were unexplained episodes. So I've been on clopidogrel for nearly 2 years when I never needed them and I'm still on the wiser as to a diagnosis. Does this sound right? I'm still not convinced that I haven't had a TIA but if I haven't what else could it be?Thanks in advance "

An ambulance was called and I was taken to the nearest hospital. I had a blood test and a CT scan. The results shown that there had a been an interruption?to the blood supply in my brain. I later found out that the area was in the right parietal lobe.¬† The blood test shown signs of infection. After some discussions between the Dr who first examined me and a Consultant and the usually tests performed. The raising of the arms and watching me walk up and down the cubicle, they decided to let me go home and arrange an appointment for me to be seen at the The Stroke Out Patients Clinic within the week.¬† I was administered 300 mg of Aspirin and antibiotics. I had to take¬† 16 antibiotics a day for 10 days.?I came home feeling not very well but I put that down to the infection.

I was sent the appointment for the Out Patients Clinic and I had the arteries in my neck scanned. They were clear. I seen the Consultant who prescribed a Clopidogrel, a blood thinning tablet. The Consultant then told me that he would arrange for an Echocardiogram and a 6 day heart monitoring event. I went for the Echocardiogram on 7th June and I go for the heart monitoring 22nd June. I will know the results when all the data has been collected.?Since the TIA for the first 5 weeks I had like a brain fog and the fatigue was terrible.

"Stroke & Tia","Does this sound like mini-stroke or MS?","So I was in the hospital last night for an 'odd' episode. I'm female in early 30s. Good health.I was standing in a shop, standing squarely, facing forward. Feet firmly planted. I had not just gotten up or anything. I had been looking at an object for a few minutes.Suddenly (and it all happened in about 15-30 seconds) my left leg started side stepping repeatedly, making my stance wider and wider. In those few seconds my brain literally thought ""why is my left leg stepping out to the side without me telling it to?"". Then I realized what was happening. I was sinking down into my left side. I think my leg possibly was trying to support me but it was like it was weak and I slumped over the side and was weak for a moment. Like that side couldn't hold me up. I never fully collapsed but was able to catch myself but it was hard. I didn't feel like I was going to pass out. It was completely different. There was no darkness closing in around me. I've had that feeling once as a child. It was not this. It was like I didn't have command over my body for a moment and it was weak.Afterwards I was very tired and light headed. I walked back to my car. Drove home (3 minutes away) and when I was about to get out, I reached for the handle of my car and missed it. I went inside. Sat down. When I got up my legs felt heavier a little for the next 20 minutes or so.Later I decided to go into the hospital and get checked. When he gave me normal routine exam, touch his fingers my nose etc I passed perfectly. They ruled out a stroke and the doctor was very adamant that it could be MS and said I would need to get a follow up.¬†¬†My question: does this sound like something people get with MS? Can it come on so suddenly and go away so suddenly?¬†They ruled out stroke, but only with EKG and blood test (i.e with no scans at all..so did they not rule it out then??)Thanks so muchNevi"

"Stroke & Tia","I'm worried I may have experienced a brief watershed stroke","I feel like this post should begin with an admission that I am prone to Hypochondria, anxiety, and inconfidence, and that I've had anxiety attacks in the past two weeks as a result of this fear. Even so, I really hope you guys don't dismiss my experiences as somehow less genuine due to my anxiety.¬†I'm a 15 year old boy, and again I hope that you recognise the legitimacy of my symptoms - even if you disagree on the cause, and I've been back at school after Christmas for two and a half weeks. Those two and a half weeks have been marked by alarm, pain, frustration, and some level of despair.¬†The incident which haunts me happened on the night before I went back to school. My mind was abuzz, swirling with thoughts and theories and fears and hopes and aspirations. This would be the night of the Second of ¬†January.¬†After I'd been laying in bed for around an hour, striding from thought to thought like I was navigating a curious maze, then I began to feel chest pains (I get these very occasionally) - but they seemed and seem benign: I roll over or move very slightly and they pass - and I began to feel my inner monologue slur. I tripped on words. I fell over in the maze.¬†I sort of attributed this to tiredness and resolved to get to sleep, but the slurring grew worse. I grew worried I might be having some kind of heart failure, that my brain was starving of Oxygenated blood, that I was having some kind of stroke due to circulatory problems. I've never really got to the bottom of the chest pains because they've always been sort of a mild annoyance, but in the past I've worried of some kind of heart failure. I've always been wrong.Anyway, this is how I went to sleep that night - uncomfortable, anxious, my optimism pained by an unrelenting fear. I managed to drift off to sleep, aided by circadian rhythm, no doubt, and I did sleep. I slept.That is, until I woke up. My eyes snapped open quite suddenly at some indeterminately early hour of the morning, I felt like something was wrong:It's hard to describe, but I sort of felt this sense of alarm and I could feel a tingling sensation in the front of my head: there wasn't any pain, just a frightening and entirely novel feeling which is sort of indescribable as anything other than a tingling or perhaps fizzing.I very quickly realised that my hands and feet were shaking, not like a shiver so much as a tremor,¬†I rolled over, they stopped. It all stopped, the horrifying tingling, the shaking, the panicked ecstasy of fumbling. It felt more like a nightmare, I sat up in bed, took a sip of water, and went back to sleep.¬†This was alll fine, I thought, but I woke up the next morning and quickly realised that something subtle felt different. It was very subtle - imperceptible¬†to others except in an exceptional silence, a dish of word salad - but I felt different, Cognition which was once effortless was suddenly much harder. I felt it when I was analysing a poem that morning. No big deal - William Blake's London - but it was astonishingly hard. My mind felt empty and the trees of curiosity did not grow.¬†I began to feel nauseous, I stumbled to the toilet bowl and held back sick. I then went to school, because I like school.¬†"
"Stroke & Tia","Stroke symptoms in a relatively healthy person,  6 months after a major surgery","My dad, 54 years old, had a major lower back surgery in April 2016. He had slip disk surgery done on same location in 1997.  In 2016 he allegedly lost much blood during surgery. End August 2016 he retired from his high pressure office job. September 2016, whilst still doing daily physiotherapy post surgery, he passed out in the bathroom for a few seconds or minutes in the morning. He went to hospital a few hours later and his bp was normal. Ensuing blood test says his Cholesterol was borderline and his haemoglobin is low. He did CT scan and they could not derive any problem from that. Middle December 2016 he had blurry vision upon waking up in the morning along with numbness of the left side of his body.  Lasted just a few minutes as well. Again bp was normal and haemoglobin low and cholesterol borderline. He is scheduled for an MRI on monday. Note prior to the 2016 episode he has no previous history of such conditions. He is very active, plays tennis once to twice weekly, and even competes regularly, he walks in mini marathons now-and-then. He is not overweight, does not smoke nor drink alcohol regularly. (Note we are in a small place with limited health facilites and health staff. A friend  had a stroke recently and they were not competent in interpreting the MRI results. Healthcare is mostly reactive here. There are no neurological specialist per say here and for any further treatment, he will have to fly out of country to closest destination with such facilites 5 hrs away).  I am trying to inform myself so as to decide on the next move we make so as not to waste the limited funds in hit and misses. My questions:1. What medical problem am i possibly looking at here? Is it a TIA? A GP dropped the term TIA on the table yesterday. 2. Could the surgery have anything to do with the symptoms he is having? As in could it be releasing blood clots in his blood stream? 3. Could the low heamoglobin and loss of blood suring surgery be the cause of be a contributory factor here.4. What are the risks i am looking at for a possible flight out of coutry for further testing, diagnosis and treatment?5. Any further critical questions i should really be asking? Thank you kindly"

"Stroke & Tia","Stroke/TIA ","Hello everyone !I am 23, student at electrical engineering (final year) and here is my story:I wanna ask someone who knows better and get a good answer about what i am going to ask and here i go with my story:To me it all happened in the beginning of July 2016 (7th july) ...after i was very tired and got drunk...went home at 4 AM and went to work at 7 AM , it was just another hangover day for me. After work, i got home at 4 PM and suddenly everything got strange and unreal, i got my biggest panic attack (never had before one) and i kept watching the mirror and i thought i was dying and having a stroke, i felt 100% detached from reality, i was totally scared and it was very very horrible.As days passed i thought about 2 things :¬†1) i was having a stroke and soon i was gonna die2) i was going crazyAfter all my fear about my health I went to the doctor, and i have done the following:many blood tests - all ok, urine tests - all okI asked the doctor if there was something wrong with my head if everything is ok, so i asked for a CT scan ...she said NO, it is not necesary ..(i have done equilibrium tests with hands and feet and were ok)...ok...then why do i sometimes feel clumsy and dizzy?..(I have to say that if i had enough money i could have done my CT scan alone at a private doctor but it is too expensive and i don't afford it.)In september i had 3 exams in one week, i passed all of them (i could learn if i concentrated more than i was doing it before, it was hard for me, can someone with a stroke learn so much in a short time?)Weeks passed, i had many panic attacks, and started reading books about how to treat my anxiety...Today , i eat very healthy, quit drinking, i go jogging but still feel wrong...i have a bit of slurred speech and it scares me..sometimes i get the dizziness and i seem to forget things and i have to concentrate to remember them. Sometimes my left arm feels clumsy but i lift and i am strong on both sides (i can lift equally with the same strength on both sides)I still fear of a stroke.My biggest question : do i have a stroke? (i need some professional answers)I had enough about researching for it ....i read about stories and i don't want to anymore.It's been 4 months since i am experiecing this stroke/panic/anxiety or whatever it is ...can someone with a stroke survive 4 months without medicine? I need to know.Thanks to everyone who took time for reading this!I wish everyone a healthy and happy life !!¬†"

"Stroke & Tia","My mother had stroke, where we can get better treatment?","My mother had stroke recently, initially she had problem with speech some times she speeks this and that only so we rushed into hospital and they started the treatment.They did all the required scans and tests (MRI,2d-Echo,BP, Sugar test).Actually she is suffering with diabetic from 4 years.As per MRI they told us she had few clots in brain, and MRI report advised for angiogram test. So tried for that too but during that test contrast came out and leg got swell.So they postponed the test and discharged after 6 days and gave 7 days medicines after that we visited again and they told she is better no, we can continue medicine for 30 days and ask us to visit after 30days.It's been 22 days completed from the day one.Now she is doing good and doing things by herself.But she is getting headache and bit weight in the head some times, they already suggested to use Dolo 650 whenever she feels headache.My doubts are,1. Can we go for any further better treatment?¬†If yes - any place/doctor/hospital for better treatment?2.Is there any dangerous if we continue with current medication without further better treatment?3.why she is getting headache? Is it normal problem for these patients?If not - what should we do?4.My mother is 49 years old and diabetic patient, so is the diabetic cause for this stroke?5.How can we prevent this problem for next time ?6.I heard NIMHANS - Banglore (India) ¬†is the place to cure more relavent diseases,does anybody know about it?7.Is it really required for angiogram test?8.Is there any permanent solution for this stroke/Diabetic?Me and my family is getting more tense and we are not able to concentrate on our jobs/works and we hide it from her, so please let us know your suggesions to make us relief.Please post your valuable suggesions.Your help is very appreciable.Thank you one and all in advance."
"Stroke & Tia","I think I may have had a mini-stroke about 8 years ago. ","I was shopping with my son for school supplies about 8 years ago and we got to the locker shelf stuff and suddenly out of nowhere I was totally confused. I didn't even know what the item was that we were looking for! Somehow or another I was able to check out and pay for the things that we got I was terribly confused. I remember I was afraid that I may not even be able to drive because I didn't even know if I could drive. But then we went through McDonald's drive-thru and I was very confused ordering, couldn't think of what a hamburger was,  but I made it through! It didn't last long and it ended. I talked to my doctor and he seemed to think it was just like a pre menopausal brain fart or something. I'm wondering... should I do anything now? I've been perfectly healthy, never had any other instance of this. My blood pressure is great it's always low. I have low thyroid so I tale Levoxyl. Just wondering if there's something I should do now or if it's too late and doesn't matter since its been 8+ years. Thanks in advance! I don't know what made me start thinking about this now, but maybe it's a God-Thing."

"Stroke & Tia","Pain after stroke","I had a stroke 10 years ago. Shortly after I started having tingling in foot preceded by excruciating pain in leg. The doctors have solution to the problem, except to treat with medication. The stroke was located in or near the thalamus which means my brain is sending erroneous messages to my leg. Nothing is wrong with leg. I take gabapentin 2400 mg a day, Xanax, baclofen, cymbalta, methadone but my leg still hurts. I wish I could figure out a medication combination that would help.

"Stroke & Tia","Need some advice.","In December 2015, I was stood at a bus stop when I had a sharp pain in my head. I went to put my hand to my head because I was in pain and next thing I remember is waking up on the floor covered in blood and screaming crying. A man who was stood at the bus stop near me had called an ambulance and stayed with me until they arrived. I was taken to hospital and given stitches because as I had fell to the ground I hit the floor so hard I broke my nose and fractured my eyebrow bone.  After having some scans and tests they came back to me with the news that I had experienced something called a subarachnoid haemorrhage. I had heard of it before but didn't know what it was. But I don't think it's normal to still have pain when I touch my head where my scar is over where I fractured my head. Is this normal 7 months later or do I need to go get it looked at?"
"Stroke & Tia","I think I may have had a TIA a of weeks ago but not sure.","I had what I thought at the time was a painless migraine with aura a couple if weeks ago and didn't really think much of it. I've had them before but honestly not for a couple if years now so I thought they had stopped. The thing is, while it was similar to previous migraines I've had the visual effects were slightly different than I remember and this gas caused me to worry.My symptoms happened over a few minutes and didn't all appear immediately intensely at first if that matters. I had a tingling in my left arm and it felt kind of numb but I could still move my hand and raise my arm above my head. I felt lightheaded like I wanted to lie down, no vertigo though. I also had a vision disturbance I find hard to describe, like it was difficult to focus on the words I was reading at the time and it was more like a bright light on one side rather than the kaleidescope pattern I'm used to. As I said it's been 2 weeks and I'm only really thinking about it now because I have only really just learned about TIAs properly. I could still speak fine and my face was unaffected so I didn't think it was a stroke but in hindsight I've started to worry it might be more serious than it originally seemed.I visited my doctor for a strange feeling I've been having in my arm for the past week and I mentioned the suspected migraine, how I was worried about it and if it might be related and she didn't really ask me to go in to any details and just treated me for anxiety but I'm not completely assured. I didn't really go in to as much detail with her because she seemed more interest in my arm discomfort. "
"Stroke & Tia","Did I have a stroke?","Alright I'll start with some background:I'm 29. I've been smoking since I was 16, marijuana and cigarettes. I drank heavily for the past 5 years.A week or so before this event, I was very stressed out. My dad had an aneurism, I had lost my job for missing work while he was in the hospital, had cars break down, etc.I had stopped the marijuana about a week before this happened, and I stopped drinking about 3 months prior.But, I was very stressed so I relapsed. I was on my third beer when I took a hit of marijuana for the first time in about a week. My heart started beating really fast and hard which is usually what happens, but I became very anxious.About 15 minutes later, I decided to hop in the shower to calm myself and wear off the high because it was too much.When I stood up from the chair:- I got really dizzy- My entire head got cold and tingly, like pins and needles when your arm or something ""goes to sleep""- My entire body got hot and I started sweating all over- My ears started ringing very, very loud- My vision started going blackI tried to drink water but I was not coordinated enough to do so. I could barely stand up. I dropped the cup in the sink and stripped down and got in the shower with cold water, but the cold water put my body into shock and I couldn't breathe so I switched it to hot water and then I started feeling better.Ever since then, my ears are constantly ringing. Not loud, but faintly. I was also fighting some mild erectile dysfunction before this, which has since become worse.Also, I'm not sure what to even call this, because I don't think it's a flutter, but my heart will randomly beat very hard. It's not irregular or anything, but like; thump-thump-thump-THUMP-thump-thump at completely random times. This has been happening for maybe a year or so.Any input is appreciated.¬†"

I live in constant fear of having another stroke...the next one being bigger...debilitating  or deadly. I've always been a worrier, but am a hundred times worse, now that I have something to worry about. Is there anyone out there who had a stroke a long time ago and never had another?

Well about 30-40 minutes later my entire left side went numb and my head started pounding and there was this ringing in my ears that kept getting louder and louder! Then my face went numb and my body felt paralyzed, I had literally no control over even part of my body, well then like my eye sight started going completely blurred.. I could still hear everything around me but everything sounded like a loud concert when you're standing close to the speaker box thing.. I didn't go to the ER or anything for it and it lasted about 15 minutes. I did research and it sounds like a ministroke but I wanted a second opinion...

"Stroke & Tia","My First Post - Anyone in a similar situation?","Hi Everyone, I am new to these forums but thought it would be good to communicate with like minded people.My partner had a large stroke in December 2015 while we were on a cruise, luckily the ship was docked in Naples at the time so we were able to get him to a hospital quickly.They suggested it was a large bleed on the brain and further examination revealed that there was evidence of earlier smaller bleeds also, although we were not aware of anything ever happening in the past.He was kept in the hospital in Naples for 14 days until he was well enough to be bought home and then for a further 10 weeks in our local hospital here in the UK.Glyn's condition was quite bad, he had almost no communication skills, was unable to control his toilet needs and was not able to eat without a great deal of help.At the end of March I was allowed to bring him home and since then he has been making small improvements, however we have had to move to a much smaller apartment and make a lot of lifestyle changes not only to help him but also for financial reasons.He is still unable to walk very far and although his speech is improved he still has a lot of difficulty, his writing and typing skills are pretty much non existant also at the moment.As his partner I have found the massive change in our life to be hugely difficult and I have to shoulder all of the stress and difficulties involved pretty much on my own.However I know that Glyn would have done exactly the same for me so I have done it willingly and with the knowledge that I love him now even more than I did before.I don't know what the future holds for him but I will be there and will do my best to make sure he gets better .It would be nice to hear from anyone who has been in a similar situation and anyone who has any tips about how to help him and how to help me stay as chilled as possible LOL."

"Stroke & Tia","Don't know what really could of happened","I had a really scary episode yesterday and I'm scared. I honestly don't think it was a panic attack. I haven't had a full blown panic attack for a long time now. I was driving my 15yo daughter to school, we were at the light and I had a weird pain in my thumb so I started pushing on it and decided to take ibuprofen which never happened, but I started feeling strange and went into a full fledged freak out. I felt like I was going to die, everything started fading which made me start to freak out more.I started thinking that I was going to die and my daughter wouldn't have me and a million other thoughts all within those few seconds which felt like forever. My body felt cold and I was shaking like a leaf. I pulled off the road and into a parking lot freaking out. I was screaming call 911!! Something is wrong with me! Once out of the car, I told my daughter not to call 911 just yet. So yeah, I got out of the car and there was a man coming out of the building so I told him what was going on. My  My tongue and roof of my mouth went completely numb. I was in a total freak out. I ended up going to urgent care with my aunt who is a nurse for over 35 years now. They ran an ekg and it came out normal, but the dr who was extremely young by the way suggested I go to ER to rule out a stroke or heart attack, but my aunt said she didn't think I needed to and that since he was young and was very by the textbook he said what he felt he needed to in order to cover his butt. He didn't seem to know anything about anxiety. He told me I didn't have any of the classic anxiety symptoms. I have been an anxiety sufferer for 10 plus years. I take citalopram 10mg daily.  Either way, now I'm freaking out thinking I might have had a TIA stroke and it's just a matter of time before I have another or a full on stroke or something serious and since I didn't go to the hospital ER I'm just a ticking time bomb. I've been googling symptoms and reading a million stories on this and completely obsessing over it. I'm so scared."

"Stroke & Tia","Possible Minor Postural Circulatory Stroke ","One week ago on Friday I took my partner to hospital as he was suffering from right arm heaviness. No other symptoms but something told me to take him to our local A&E. Following thorough neurological examinations and tests by an Advanced Nurse Practioner, an A&E Dr and two Stroke Consultants, a CT scan was done, a chest x-ray and bloods. CT scan clear. Chest x-ray clear. Full blood count fine, U/E's fine and liver function tests all normal. Cholesterol 5.6, Having an MRI done on 13th February. No other outward symtoms. Dr treating as if it is a minor postural circulatory stroke. My partner does not smoke, does not dring alcohol, is not overweight and eats a healthy diet. This has come as a bit of a shock. I am trying to be strong to support him and WE WILL get through this with help and maybe physiotherapy. He is not feeling himself and this episode has really knocked his confidence. He is a fit, healthy and extremely confident man with a strong constitution. I am doing as much research as I can but suppose I need to wait for a formal diagnosis first. The wind has been knocked out of my sails. I cannot rest and concentrate on anything until I know what we are dealing with. Any advice anyone can give would be much appreciated. Thank you."

Anyway we chose our meal from the buffet and when I started eating I felt a bit light headed, then I could not lift my left arm up properly to move my fork to my mouth. my speech was unaffected but, I felt. Well. Strange. When we finished our meal and I got up, I could not walk properly, my left knee would not bend. To be honest I was walking like a zombie!! My wife was extremely worried. However after rehydrating myself the symptoms passed. We enjoyed the rest of our holiday with no more problems. Now to me it is weird because at the time my TIA was occuring, my wife looked at me and asked if I was ok. I said no, if I did not know better I would say I was having a stroke!! Now seeing as I have never been really ill or know anything on strokes where the heck did that come from??? Anyway after getting home and ringing my sister who is a nurse. I got my stubborn male torso to the doctors who diagnosed a probable TIA. I now await a hospital appointment.

"Stroke & Tia","Stroke History","I had a left side stroke 3 years ago (Nov 2011) Age 77. I completely lost my memory, not knowing my son, or my husband. My husband noticed my speech was disrupted "" speaking gobblygook"" he said. I was taken to A&E and admitted to the Stroke Unit following a CT scan. I was asked many questions that I was unable to answer.¬†My memory returned gradually over the next few days. It was very frightening, but the staff were brilliant. The Consultant tried to reassure me I hadn't got a tumour, which I originally thought I had. My reasons for thinking this were constant severe headaches and loss of balance with several falls.He arranged an MRI which showed the stroke area clearly. I was discharged once my BP and other symptoms had returned to an acceptable level. This was 3 weeks later.Since then I have continued to suffer memory lapses and massive loss of confidence, with panic attacks for which I had counselling.Since that time I have had several TIA's, not sure of the numbers, have suffered with unexplained sudden blackouts, initially requiring another stay in hospital until my BP returned to normal.¬†I am terrified of having another stroke, because I still have lapses in memory.¬†I am on Warfarin and blood pressure tablets. My INR stays fairly constant in the 2.2-2.5 range.¬†I would be interested in hearing from anyone who can share their experience and any suggestions/tips for how to improve my memory and confidence levels.¬†"

"Stroke & Tia","TIA or migraine or?","Hi, I am new here. I'd like to share my story (sorry if it's too long)In 2009, I was writing my thesis, I was so stressful, didn't have enough sleep, and my diet was terrible. One afternoon I had a headache on left side and the next morning I couldn't really move my right foot but gradually it got better. The next morning all muscles in my body were painful and stiff though I was still able to walk and move. The next day the pain and stiffness improved but I got dizzy, light headed and panic attack a number of times. Years went by, most of the symptoms disappeared though I ocassionally have mild heart arrhythmia and dizziness. My muscle strength recovered but endurance is reduced. But I live a normal life without anxiety.In May 2015, I had heart arrhythmia (SVT) for 8 hrs was taken to emergency. Blood test showed my potassium was low. I was discharged the next day. Since then I sometimes have mild, brief arrhythmia. In August, I started to feel pain in my left chest, then disappeared, then I had headache (again left side) followed by dizziness and light headed. I took magnesium which improved the arrhythmia. All my blood test came out normal. I also feel that my breath is having a hard time keeping up when I'm doing normal activity. All of these symptoms resemble one in 2009. I'm going to have a holter monitor to monitor my heart.Is it possible that I have TIA or mild stroke? Most of GP said I was just having anxiety or psychosomatic syndrome. I'm 36 yo male by the way. My blood pressure is usually normal. Many thanks."

"Stroke & Tia","""Just a migraine""","That is how the neurologist at the local A&E diagnosed me with and prescribed Imagrin and 3 days in a darkened room! This was despite the fact that both myself and my GP (who had phoned the neurologist department and spoken to a neurologist who said they would see me straight away if I went up to A&E) that this was nothing like any migraine I had ever suffered and I have suffered since 3 years of age (I'm now 50), anyway to cut a long story short I followed his advice and on the 5th day of suffering (I sat up A&E for nearly 6 Hours) I went back to my GP and was re-refered back to the neurologist who originally said they would see me and had sent their colleague, she organised an eye test as I still had what they described as an Aura, I past the eye test although it was obvious that some of my sight was restricted and I responded slower to the light! Anyway the neurologist said that she was also convinced it was just a lingering migraine, but if my vision had not come back by the Friday (8 day mark) she would arrange an MRI scan, she phoned me to check first and then made the arrangements for my scan which took place on the 2 week mark, then I had to wait a further 2 weeks for the results....well the results came in last Friday and it turns out I had a stroke of the left visual cortex which has taken a patch the size of a 10p piece! So the neurologist who gave me the bad news on Friday was the first one I saw at A&E, he prescribed me a life long drug to reduce my platelets and informed me that I will be having loads more tests including tests on my heart. Anyway when I got home my husband read the patient information leaflet and to his horror found out that the drugs the neurologist had prescribed could NOT be taken by some one with peanut allergy (I'm allergic to all nuts and this is stated all over my notes and something I always mention when a Dr is prescribing any medication) so I phoned the hospital on Saturday morning and was told not to take them and they would get back to me on Monday (which is today) to let me know about my new drugs and sorting out my perscription (I live 14 miles away from the hospital, but they think it is just next door!) well it is now nearly 5 in the afternoon and all I'm getting when I phone them is engaged, to say I'm getting stressed out is just a little bit of an understatement as I'm now 32 days since my stroke and only received treatment a stroke victim is not supposed to have!!!!

Two weeks ago I was visiting my brother and I was out in his garden and collapsed. I was aware of going down but couldn't stop it from happening g. I thought I was just going down on my knees but next thing I was aware of my whole body slumping to the ground. Once down I tried to lift my head and couldn't. I had no strength in my arms legs or head and realised I would just have to lie there for a while. I think it was about 15 minutes later I got some movement back in my arms and was able (with more determination than I'd ever used in my life before) to slowly get myself up off the ground. I went, very slowly, to the bathroom and my face was covered in blood. I had bitten my lip quite badly and also had scrapes and scratches in my face from the collapse. Ever since I have not felt well but unable to pinpoint where the unwellness comes from. I've had a few mild shooting pains in my neck and now I think I have a slight weakness in my right hand grip. Yesterday I had a terrible fuzziness in my head. I've had vertigo in the past and this fuzziness wasn't like vertigo.

"Stroke & Tia","Repeat symptoms","Hi, I experienced my TIA 5 weeks ago. I lost my speech for a few minutes which was a bit scary. I immediately went to A&E where I was dealt with very well. I'm on Clopidogrel & Atorvastatin. Sometimes a whole week goes by without any repeat symptoms but I do get odd feelings e.g. on two or three occasions my nose has numb sensations & today my arm & shin are tingly. Having had the regular tests & scans over the past weeks, I have an appointment with the TIA consultant in two weeks, I presume to give me the results, I'll tell him about the repeat incidents but should I be concerned in the meantime? Thanks."

"Stroke & Tia","Wondering about dizzy spells","About a year ago I had a few mornings when I woke up groggy and slightly dizzy (bit like a hangover) which took ¬†a few hours to pass. On one or two occasions when walking to get the morning paper I had definite dizzy spell lasting less than a minute on one occasion needing supported I thought I might be close to feinting. That occurred in a 3 month period then no symptoms. Year. Later I have had one or two groggy mornings and slightly dizzy. I am 67 and male. I am just wondering as this is obviously head related if this is stroke symptoms. I have had blood test recently and been told my red and white cell counts are about 15% below range (due to have a second blood test soon to presumably check if it has changed). As one symptom of a stroke is dizziness I wonder if I might be given warnings here. Feedback appreciated."
"Stroke & Tia","Are these stroke symptoms? :S ","I have been getting pins and needles in my left arm and the left side of my face acompanied by an intense headache, which is then followed by vomiting. I went to the doctor and they sent me to have a blood test, where they took a lot of samples, and it came back that nothing is wrong with my blood, so I have been refered to the neurologist.It is going to be a 3 month wait, but i don't want to and won't wait 3 months if this are symptons of a stroke, or anything else that is relatively serious! I get these symptons every-so-often and they started to occur around January time, and it is now about 7 months later...I have been considering ringing 999 whenever i get these symptons because i just don't know if the doctors missed something?

"Stroke & Tia","TIA at 28years old but my doctors are in denial","HiI am 28 years old healthy male that has had an TIA but doctors are in denial and discriminating my health on the basis I am fit and healthy male, far too young to have TIA but I KNOW they are wrong and have not correctly diagnosed me.Over the last few months I have had allot of stress to deal with on my own. However, I do go   gym regularly and my diet is healthy too. I am south Asian male, both my parents are           Diabetics, high blood pressure suffers. My mother side of the family tend to suffer from heart condition but I dont know if the heart condition is not genetic or not. This puts me in higher risk of developing a stroke.Over the last few weeks I have been suffering from cluster headaches and I know this was partly because I was and still am under alot of physical and emotional stress. After suffering my very strong migraine attackes, on tuesday I had experienced unexpected sudden attack like I had never experienced before.While having cluster headaches, one side of mind was thumping like never before but my left face was going really numb within minutes from the left side of face, going down to left side of my neck and left side of chest, everything on that side began tightening so much so, I was going through the strong motion of everything being felt as though it was being pulled down and tightening even more into spasms. When I looked in the mirror, I could not see the physical symptom of my face dropping but was feeling it, and the strong feeling of numbness. the attack last for 20 minutes. After the incident, I was finding it very difficult to eat because my left side of face, neck, throat and chest area was strongly feeling strained as though it had been dislocated. I reported it to nhs direct, who sent me to emergency doctor.The doctor played it down, and said it was just migraine attacks but I knew it wasn't, I had a TIA and stupid doctor just measured me by her past experience patients which is wrong and unfair. However, I went to my local doctors the next day to report the incident, I was still suffering from the after affects, they also played it down. I was told to give blood sample and had ECG done few days later. I am waiting for my blood results, but ecg test has came back as normal, my blood pressure is normal and so is my sugar levels. Doctors are not finding any evidence to show I had suffered a stroke, But i know as well as having cluster headache I was suffering from TIA yet at the same time. I think my TIA attack could have been alot worse if i didnt lead a healthy lifestyle like going gym and good diet but it is not my fault if the results are coming back as normal because I never imagined the whole thing.However my doctors have not done a brain scan, or mri, I was suffering from the after affects still, I went to A & E who did not treat me, after I told them my doctor is aware of health problem and am waiting for results. I was told more or less my doctor has got everything in control in the meantime live with the chest pains I was having,  ""it is anxiety making me believe everything is 10 times worse then it actually is"". The nurse was making whole lot of assumptions when I challenged her assumptions, she still got the doctor to see me just so the hospital had the backs covered in doing their routine but were not doing their job properlyand did not do any tests or taken any notice of my chest pains with numbness to the face.I am completly upset with the medical profession and do not know what type I test can have done to confirm I had TIA attack?, All I know is as god is my witness that i had a mini stroke and my local doctors are pathetic for not picking this up sooner. I am gone go back on Monday for my blood test results in the meantime, I have been given sumatriptan at 50mg to stop the migraine attack which seems to be doing the trick but yet my face is still numb my left side is still sore and strained. which makes me believe it is not just a migraine attack i had.I am documenting everything in my diary the time and dates I have been seeing doctors and each time I KEEP telling I have had a tia attack because I know this will happen again in the future and in the meantime I knocked on all the medical profession doors for help but they are not doing their jobs properly. If my health gets affected where I cannot do my normal routine in the future then I will be suing my local surgery and the NHSa for not giving the correct, advice, support or medication.Sometime I can't help but be cynical in thinking doctors don't like being told by patients when they are wrong and as a result the doctors let their pride get in the way when it comes to making the correct diagnosis. Doctors are nothing but humans being, they are not GOD that they think they know it all. as human beings they make mistakes and making mistakes from careless which is gone cost patient their health is wrong!

"Stroke & Tia","TIA in younger people?","I just wondered if you had or know of any young people who have had a TIA? How likely is it? I'm probably worrying about nothing, but i have been to the doctors and it is being investigated. 4 days ago at work my vision went distorted, the left side of my vision went 'cracked' and flashing and this lasted for about twenty minutes. I didn't have a headache or no other symptoms. I closed my left eye thinking it was my left eye but i could still see it in my right eye, so i ruled out it being my eyes. I told the doctor 2 days later at an appointment and he said although unlikely at my age (22 yo female) he referred me to a TIA clinic, took some blood, tested my BP, eyes, reflexes, reflexes a little off apparently but nothing major. Also changed my contraception as the one i was on can increase your chance of blood clots....I was just wondering could this seriously have been a TIA? He suspects it's a silent migraine but not taking any chances so having a scan next week. It's just got me quite worried now! "
"Stroke & Tia","Could I Have had a stroke or if not what is wrong with me ??","Really need some advice, not getting anywhere with the NHS. Up to 12 months ago I had never felt better. Lost 2 stone, down to 15 stone, completed a 10K Run, life was great. Not long after, around June 2013 I started to get breathless episodes. Went to GP, he was torn between Cardio or Chest Specialist and referred me to Cardio. Before I got to see anyone I ended up getting admitted to Hospital with Chest Pains. All heart tests were fine and had a CT Scan of my lungs and they said that was clear also and discharged me, telling me that I should continue with the Cardio Investigations.I did do,¬†over the following months I had a Angiogram and Heart Scan all tests showed that my heart was fine.In September, whilst working at my desk, I suddenly suffered a headache that got worse over a matter of minutes. It was a burning sensation around my left eye. At the same time I was horrified to find I could not swallow saliva, when I tried to stand up I was severely dizzy. I couldnt lift my head up to look at anyone, I could hardly get my words out. I managed to raise the alarm and the paramedics arrived. As my heart was ok I was taken to hospital at normal speed and examined. Whilst at the hospital, the pain subsided but my eye felt like it was hanging out of the socket. My wife noticed that the left side of my face had dropped¬†and the pupil of that eye was fixed small and was so for a couple of weeks. I got discharged with an explanation that it may be a migraine. I couldnt even walk without assistance, that last a couple of days. It took me a couple of days for my speaking to come back, I had difficulty swallowing for weeks. I started to get tingling sensations on my right leg and lower back and over the next 2 days this spread so if you cut my body in half from the lower chest all the right side suffered nerve pain, tingling, numbness, pins and needles, cramp in chest, side, back, genital area, leg and foot. I still suffer this now, 24 hours a day, it doesnt stop me walking or even running a little but makes me unflexible, nausious and is worse after being stationery or on my feet too long.I have had a brain MRI Scan and this showed no evidence of a stroke, I have had an MRI scan of the top 2 segments iof my spine and again no evidence of a neurological disorder. The Radiographer did not understand why the lumber spine was not scanned with the pain being primarily in my leg. I MUST AGREE AND AM SEEING MY GP TO RAISE THIS POINT NEXT WEEK. I have found out that at the point I had this ""stroke like episode"" I had a lung infection, missed on the original CT Scan. Yet another question is that as an MRI Scan was not done as soon as I had this episode is it possible I had a stroke even though there is no evidence in the current MRI Brain Scan.

"Stroke & Tia","Could you have a stroke but not know?","A while ago my grandfather had a stroke. He was absolutely healthy and so this came really out of the blue. The doctors put it down to the formation of his veins and arteries in his brain. It was a congenital thing. Meaning go it runs in the family. This got me thinking for as long and as I can remember I have been experiencing little strange things. I will try to name a few. Memory loss is one of those, it happens all the time. I will be in the middle of doing something but for some reason I will forget what I was doing or I could be in the middle of a conversation and forget and find it hard to remember a certain words like iPad or phone or glasses, really common words. I also have weakness in my right side. I always seem to loose the grip of something I am holding. My eye sight in my left eye is not as good either, it is really noticeable when I do eye liner or eye shadow. I also seem to talk more from my left side of my face and when I smile my mouth it only happen with one side. My left eye can't open as much as the right. I am only 19 and it is starting to worry me. So could I have had one as a child and never knew?"

"Stroke & Tia","What could these strange feelings be following my TIA 2 weeks ago","Two weeks ago, out of nowhere, I suffered a TIA. My mouth drooped to the right, my tongue went to the right as well and my speech slurred. My wife recognised the symptoms and immediately called 999 The ambulance arrived in 8 minutes, by which time I was almost back to normal. Then it came back again. Long story short, a night in hospital, (the scan showed to previous episodes, but not the one I was in there for, but was told it may be too early to show) sent home the next day with follow up appointments etc etc. Since then, between approximately midday-ish and 3 or 4 pm I feel really  strange. Hard to put my finger on it but I feel a bit lightheaded and become aware of my mouth and throat.  It's not pain, numbness or tingling, just a feeling. Not the same as when I had the TIA. There is also a slight achy, pain in my left upper arm. It first became really noticeable 5 days after the original TIA and my wife called 111 and we ended up with a paramedic and an ambulance again. I didn't go  to hospital but saw an out of hours doctor. The hospital had detected an irregular  heartbeat, which I knew about, and thought it could be atrial fibrillation. However, two doctors have now seen the ECG taken by the ambulance crew on the second occasion and both are adamant it's not that. So, could these feelings be the remains of the TIA? I understood that after a TIA you should go back to normal within about 24 hours. Is this going to go away? It has got a little better than it was, but not much and the last few days have been pretty much the same as each other with little or no further improvement.Would be grateful for any comments anyone may have. Thank youDavid"
"Stroke & Tia","HAS ANYONE BEEN PRECRIBED STATINS FOLLOWING STROKE","HelloMy son has been prescribed blood thinning medication (Clopidogrel) and statins following an apparent stroke (silent one in his sleep), just awoke one morning to find a problem with his eyesight.

His cholesterol very quickly reduced to a total of 2.9 (HDL 1.2; LDL 1.2) and I feel concerned at how low this is, knowing that we all need cholesterol in our bodies.

No issues with his blood, blood vessels, Heart, Colestral or any finding from scans. He has had a heart monitor fitted which has shown no heart issues.He has never smoked, rarely drank alcolhol, stopped drinking coffee, drinks plenty of water, and is active in the garden and walks to the shops. He has just turned 80 and is still very fit and mentally active.He has even had his Gas boiler changed just in case.This is not simply old age and I am desperate to understand what is happening as the specfialists have admitted that they have no idea.

"Stroke & Tia","Warfarin Versus Clopidogrel for Dissection - HELP!","Hi Folks,I had a stroke last year caused by a triple vessel dissection (I don't like to do things by halves!) which they've yet to find a cause for. At 36 this was a total shock as I've always been proud to say I've never really been ill. But I got this cough and I coughed and coughed. Then I thought 'I've pulled a muscle in my neck with coughing' but now I know this was one of my arteries splitting and a stroke followed. I've was put on warfarin and I've been followed up with MRI/MRA's every 6 months. The most recent one in April 2013 showed that one of my vessels has recovered completely, one at the back is blocked completely and they don't expect it to open up, and my other vessel (the basilar artery) has quite a significant narrowing.At my last consultation my neurologist has advised me that in his opinion he thinks we should stop the warfarin due to the long term effects of the drug and switch me over to clopidogrel (kind of like aspirin).I've said I want to have a think about it as so far (touch wood) I've been OK on Warfarin (ie.no other strokes) although I hate the restrictions it has on my lifestyle (diet, alcohol and I really want kids). So I'm scared to rock the boat, but then again I'm worried that if I don't all always wonder why I didn't.So my questions to anyone who's out there reading this is: Anyone been in a similar situation? Would did you decide? Does anyone know of any evidence recommending one of the above over the other? I know of one study but the outcome was that they couldn't find any evidence to support using one over the other.Does anyone know where else I can look for some evidence to support my decision?I really hope you can help.Sally"
