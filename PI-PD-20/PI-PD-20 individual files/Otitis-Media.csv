"Otitis Media","A month and a half ago i developed otitis media. after treatment of 10 days antibiotics i still couldn't hear well from my right ear. The doctor then told me it takes time to clear and i should wait. My ear isnt in the condition it was but i still cant hear like my left ear. I went to another doctor he checked otoscopic and did a tympanogram. Everything looks good he said. My audiogram has a decline in 4000hz spectrum. After he told me that the be some damage to the nerve i panicked and tinnitus appeared the same day. But.. the weber test lateralized on the problematic ear. Which means conductive loss.Other than that i also feel my ear to be full or stiff I can't explain it. Also when i eat it pops and actually feels like pumping air. I dont know what is going on the only think i didn't check is my nose and throat.Anyone that can make any sense out of this?"
"Otitis Media","I will try to make this as short as I can and to the point.so I'm 30/M, and I have had ETD (self diagnosed) for 10 years now. we all know what comes with that; clicking, popping, pressure, tinnitus etc. For myself, that was and has been bearable .... up until now. My recent symptom that I have got is a constant low humming sound in one ear (right). it's the feeling you get when a rush of blood goes to your head when you stand up fast, after being sat down for a large period of time, but only with this, it is with my ear and it is constant. This is followed with some pressure in that same ear. Can anyone relate to this? Does anyone know what this could be? I do create a lot of earwax so I was thinking it could be 'impacted earwax""?"
"Otitis Media","Hi all, quick question I desperately need to see an ENT consultant as my GP can no longer help me. I am speaking to them today just to see if they can do this however usual wait for an appointment is months also we are currently in the middle of a pandemic. I'm from the UK, I can't wait weeks. Just wondering if there is anything that will speed up the process??"
"Otitis Media","hi all,I've just had my appointment with an ENT doctor who also specializes in vertigo and general dizziness.he also suffers with vertigo himself so has an understands what its like.he diagnosed me with BPPV and persistent postural perceptual dizziness.it was a consultation over the phone due to the pandemic which lasted 45mins but suggested we had a face to face appointment for an examination etc.. he didn't charge me for the initial phone consultation which was good of him.glad to be finally diagnosed. if anyone suffers with brain fog, fuzzy head and non vertigo dizziness read about pppd.if anyone needs his details please let me know.he was very helpful and said he has a 90% success rate with treating dizziness. he also said a little bit of alcohol could help"
"Otitis Media","I (17M) woke up with severe tinnitus 2 months ago and I haven't been able to see a doctor due to the pandemic. I was tired of waiting so I bought an endoscope to see inside my ears myself and my ear drums do not look normal at all (See photos below).A few notes:I feel pressure in both earsWhen I move my jaw or turn my head the tinnitus gets louder.It crackles when I open my mouth and when swallowing.I was prescribed antibiotics over the phone but they never worked.My ears ache now and again.There have been times where all of a sudden the tinnitus would spike incredibly loud and then slowly go down again over 30 seconds.I have tried nasal sprays for congestion.Pictures:"
"Otitis Media","hi i developed this rash yesterday luckily it went away today but still wondering what it could have been. looks weird"
"Otitis Media","Hello can anyone tell me what is wrong here? Very itchy and now sore. ringing in ear. is it an infection or healing from a poked eardrum?thank you."
"Otitis Media","Hi all, since the beginning of this year, I've been dealing with cold/flu-type symptoms. heavily blocked ears, increased difficulty breathing through my nose due to resistance, an occasionally sore throat, and persistently scratchy/raw-feeling chest. Generally, I feel rough, and lethargic.Despite being asthmatic, my breathing was becoming so difficult, that doctors increased my daily asthma inhaler dosage, which appears to have helped. They also prescribed antibiotics and steroids. Sadly, the ear pain persists. A large amount of wax has now thankfully come out of my right ear, using sodium bicarbonate drops on a regular basis. I've been seen by a doctor who said my right ear was completely clear with no sign of infection, perforation, scarring, or blockage, but later that night, I awoke almost deaf on one side, with even more wax oozing out, which has been consistently thick, sticky, and very dark. This was about the fourth/fifth large amount (each about the size of a large pea) that has come out over the course of a month, and I have had a great number of these blockages over the years, which have usually been irrigated. I don't insert anything down my ear canal, as I know this can make things worse.Right ear feels clearer now, to an extent, but tinnitus remains very loud on both sides. Strong and persistent feeling of pressure in my inner ears, temples and TMJs. A very small amount of clear fluid comes from my right ear, every now and then, even having stopped using the bicarb drops. Sensations of cracking and popping on both sides. I suspect, I probably have a nasal drip, too.Resistance in my nose is a real annoyance when breathing, and has been for years. I have had a camera up my nose relatively recently, which suggested that one nostril deviates to the right quite noticeably, but nothing was done to correct it. I also suffer from allergies, but don't think I've been exposed to anything which would trigger a reaction.To me, this all seems to be linked somehow, but I'm still none the wiser. Very grateful for any advice, as it really does affect my day-to-day. Would be good to try and understand how and why this keeps happening."
"Otitis Media","Hello,I have recently been diagnosed with a 25mm acoustic neuroma. I am a 33 year old female in pretty good overall health. The tumour is pressing on my brainstem. I live in Ontario, Canada. I saw the neurosurgeon today and was told it is at least a 10 month wait for surgery. i was told some people wait over 2 years. Any Canadians who had an acoustic neuroma receive surgery? How long did you wait? 10 months seems long!"
"Otitis Media","Hi everyone, not sure if I am posting this in the correct place, I am having some problems with a whistling noise in my ears and my balance, let me tell you how it all started, please bear with me, so about 8 months ago, I was changing the oil in my car, as I dropped the sump bolt out, quite a lot of oil went into my right ear canal, I got as much out as I could, I will come back to this later, I have since tried warm olive oil and otex in my ear and there is still bits of oil on a ear bud I when I use them, on Feb 26 if this year, I was driving on the motorway and started to feel off balance and had a panic attack due to this, now as I said earlier, I have a constant whistling sound in my ears, mainly feels like the right side and feeling off balance sometimes, my forehead sometimes feels quite heavy, and my right ear feels full/blocked, my question is, could this be down to the motor oil that got into my ear canal, my doctor says this is not possible, also about November I had a lump of sorts on the right side of my gum, dentist was sending me for hospital checks on it, but with this virus all my hospital appointments have been postponed, the lump has since gone, any help would be much appreciated thanksP.S, I was prescribed beconase spray to see if my eustachian tube was blocked, I used the spray twice daily for 2 weeks with no improvement"
"Otitis Media","I've posted before about a leaking ear. The GP said it was a fungal ear problem after the surgery took a swab and sent it for testing. The GP prescribed Caneston (which is very difficult to get in the ear when living alone). I must have put in too much which resulted in terrific discomfort and pain. I am now more careful but after 5 days the ear is even worse. Anybody successfully treated fungal ears. Sounds horrible!"
"Otitis Media","for the past several months ive had this going on.on and off i get a clogged blcoked feeling in my ears. i can hear myself breath particularly through my left ear and its quitete annoying. it causes me to deel the need to clear my throat and nose often. no pain. i went to a doctor two months aho and they told me it was ear wax cleaned it and nothing happened. along with thos i get the occaeional swollen glands in my neck and the need to swollow constantly to try clesr the swollen feeling.i dont have a fevermy nose isnt runny at alli dont have any ear painon occasion my neck will feel a little sore on my right side up under my jaw.i also grt a bitter taste in my mouth.my right tosil also seems a little swollen but ive only noticed this in the past day.Last year my mum passed,so could this all be stressed induced ?do i have an infection of some kind, tooth, ear, sinus thats not cleared for MONTHS?pls help"
"Otitis Media","My partner (36 y/o male) says his hearing is a bit weird today and that he feels like he's lost his hearing slightly in one ear. I suggested that it was earwax, but when I had a look I didn't see any obvious wax. He hasn't tried cleaning it out with a bud yet, though.I was just worried because I googled it and a website said that sudden ear loss in one ear was a medical emergency. I mean I think they were referring to complete loss in one ear but I am a hypochondriac so I am scared. He's being really blase about it though, and doesn't have any other issues. I believe his mum has ear problems -I think she has tinnitus and is going a little deaf and uses a hearing aid from time to time, but she's in her 60s. His Dad I believe has earwax build-up problems and has to have it removed occasionally. My partner has had wax build-up before but I can't see anything with my eyes anyway and he also claims he hasn't lost some hearing like this before (but he is pretty forgetful if I am honest so I wouldn't be surprised if he had).Anyone had a little hearing loss come on? What was it and is it safe to wait and see if it goes?"
"Otitis Media","Hello! Since maybe late February I've been experiencing a ear problem. It seems like my ear feels like it vibrates when its either a yell or a bark for about 3 seconds and goes away. I meant to go to the clinic but the with COVID around I rather not. I've been trying to think about what could have caused it. I searched up these pills I were taking called water pills because of my high blood pressure (148/95) and they are linked with tetanus. I've been doing little things to try to help turn it around (as I have for a while like drinking more water, fruits, exercise ect.) I try to wear headphones only when necessary. Something else I noticed is today, when I using a application I kept clicking a button and spammed it for like 5-7 times my ear would make a small vibration noise, maybe a second. Anyways, I'm afraid of working my summer job, construction, because of this. I do not know what to do. Will lowering my blood pressure help?"
"Otitis Media","I had an ear infection some weeks ago which cleared up, I thought, with Otomize spray from the gp. The infection returned but this time with yellow watery liquid seeping out and initially stabs of pain. Doctor took swab to send to hospital but have just learned after ringing myself that the result is ""normal"". The pain has gone but the ear is still merrily leaking yellow liquid. Anybody experienced leaking ears?"
"Otitis Media","So the other day I blew my nose and soon after I had pressure and pain in right ear like fluid or something else was clogged in there. I've been congested the past few days but I don't think this is connected anymore. It's now not painful but just pressurized feeling and uncomfortable with ringing. I can still hear out of it but not well. The other side of my head altogether is fine. It's been almost a couple days now and I don't know what do as nothing has helped. Breathing exercises and chewing has done nothing and when I strongly breath out I can hear the air going in with more muddy amplification than the other. If I make a vocal sound while doing this I hear it very loud from the inside. If I blow it and get something it's always a crackly, squelchy sound. No discharge or anything on the outside. I'm not having any nausea or vertigo/dizzy spells. Just full, uncomfortable, and ringing."
"Otitis Media","hi everyone ,Im 28 and Iv been suffering with an on going problem with my right ear with about 5 months.my symptoms are :hearing losspressure in ear esp when i bend over/stand up or go the toileta heartbeat sound that comes and goes throughout the day , can be worse at timesfeels like theres wind in my ear tooIv been to my doctor a couple of times , was prescribed antibiotics to treat a middle ear infection , didnt work.my doctor has me transferred to see an ENT and have been waiting a couple of months and have heard nothing. I believe with the Covid 19 I will be waiting sometime. I do not want to hasstle my doctor again with everything going on either.Has any one suffered something similar that may be able to shed some light to whats the cause or even any remedies ?Much appreciated"
"Otitis Media","Hi,I've had a blocked ear without pain for 10 days. I left it for a week to see if it went away, but no luck so was advised by doctor over phone to try Otex ear drops to soften the presumed build-up of wax for 10-14 days and then the wax can be removed by syringe. After 2 days of the drops, my ear now feels painful with constant 'pressure' inside. I also can't hear anything out of that ear. Is this what normally happens with ear drops? It also seemed odd to me to have to apply drops for so long before anything can be done - it's so uncomfortable I don't know if I'll be able to manage for nearly 2 weeks! By the way, I have only spoken to my doctor by phone because I'm in a vulnerable group for COVID-19 and didn't want to go to see him in person because (at that time) my ear was just slightly blocked.Any advice or similar stories with resolution would be much appreciated. Thank you."
"Otitis Media","Hi,I have advanced periodontal disease (periodonitis) and am wondering if anyone has experienced or knows of a correlation between the periodontal and tinnitus?Also have what feels like ears being blocked, ear pain, and loss of sense of taste.Also mouth and neck pain.These symptoms have been present for about 4 days now."

"Otitis Media","Hi all,After having ear micro suction done for ear wax back in Feb , I developed bad ear pain with discharge and the GP diagnosed a perforation ( right ear )I was advised to wait for natural healing but in March had to call GP as had ear and facial pain and a constant wet ear. By now my hearing was very muffled but only on right side.Due to coronovirus I couldn't go to surgery so was prescribed Amoxicillin and advised to give it longer to heal.Things didnt improve so the surgery agreed to see me last week and the nurse confirmed I still have a 2mm perforation.I was prescribed sofradex ear drops, but couldnt get them at any pharmacy as they are dis- continued !Phoned back GP who advised give it another 2 weeks.Its driving me mad ! Cant hear properly, ear ache comes and goes and still feels sticky ( especially on waking )Had anyone had this ? How long did it take to resolve ?My GP did refer me to ENT (who didnt see me in person) they contacted to advise eardrops and time .I had to pay to have my ear de waxed as its not available on the NHS now.Wish Id never bothered now.Thanks in advance"
"Otitis Media","Hi everyone,I've just had a stapedectomy in my right ear and thought I would share my experience with others who may be considering this operation. I'll try and update this every couple of days, but feel free to ask any questions you might have in the meantime. I've really benefitted from reading people's first hand accounts in the lead up to this op so this is my opportunity to try and give something back to this niche stapedectomy community ;-).Background to Stapedectomy: Since Dec 2016 I started to notice that I was losing hearing in my right ear. At first it was only minor (20% loss) but by early 2018 I was classified as severly deaf in that ear at around 85-90% loss. The severe hearing loss had a big impact on my social life, my ability to carry out simple tasks (i.e. riding my bike) as well as my work (meetings became a struggle). All of this coincided with a 10 year relationship break up in 2017, which when combined with my hearing problems, made me the social equiavalent of Gollum from Lord of the Rings. Something had to be done...Getting Diagnosed: Getting the diagnosis for Otosclerosis in my right ear took a bit of time. Initially I thought it was wax build up and went to see a Dr in Romania while visiting my then girlfriends parents. They couldn't find any wax and recommended an MRI to check it wasn't anything sinister. Returning to the UK I got an appointment with the ENT department who undertook a series of checks and concluded I had Eustachian Tube Dysfunction. Cue several months of steam baths, decongestants, anti-hystamines none of which were effective in improving my hearing. I also had a CT scan which confirmed that there were no tumours present (these tumours are often harmless even if found). Returning to ENT after 6 months ready to demand grommets for my ears I was put through a hearing test again. This confirmed I was now severly deaf in my right ear, but also that my Eustachian Tubes were functioning normally. Hmmm? What had happened?It turns out that the machine that they would have used to check the pressure in my middle ear canal wasn't working during my original appointment and therefore they were unable to discount ETD. Annoying.My crude understanding of how they diagnosed my Otosclerosis is as follows. Ear drum was working fine, my auditory nerve was picking up sound fine (checked through bone conductivity tests if I remember correct) and my middle ear pressure was also good. By process of elimination they were pretty sure it was my a mechanical problem with my 3 ear bones, in particular the stapes.Why did I opt for the Op? At the time I was given the option of hearing aids (hmm); a Bone anchored hearing aid (i.e. a hearing aid implanted into your skull) or a Stapedectomy. My personal reasons for going for the op were 1. my hearing was so bad in the affected ear that I felt the risk of losing my hearing totally through the op would not have resulted in a much worse situation to the one I was already in. 2. The success rate was for the op appeared to be good and could be undertaken as a day case 3. The op offered the potential to hear completely normally again. The other two options would have provided more artificial hearing benefits. 4. Probably an element of vanity about not wanting to wear hearing aids of have an implantDay of the op: So I was quite nervous about the prospect of a general anaesthetic (GA). I woke up on the day of my surgery Tues 8th and had to skip my coffee and breakfast as per the rules. The order of play went a bit like this....1. Seen by nurse who checked vitals2. Seen by anaesthesist3. Seen by surgeon4. Dress in funny clothes and excellent socks5. Go into the operating theatre, have a small freak out about how many people are there just for you, get a mask over your face and then passing out.In all seriousness I am a fairly anxious person, but the NHS staff were amazing and knowing what was coming each step of the way really helped quash any mystery about the process. Essentially GA is extremely safe unless you are a 120 year old man being rushed into A&E with half an arm and a penchant for long mid-morning snoozes.Waking up and Day 1: The surgery took 2 hours for me, although 45-60mins is more common (i have a small ear canal apparently!). and you'll generally be put under for about 4 hours in total.Waking up you will have a nurse checking your vitals and handing you some water to sip. Everyone has a different post GA experience (inc. hysterical laughing, crying and memory loss) but for me I was just moderately dizzy and very lethargic. I got wheeled into a recovery room for about an hour an ate everything they had on offer. The first trip to the toilet was difficult as was putting on my clothes due to being so off balance.I was given some paracetemol and Ibuprofen for the pain (at this point there was none) as well as some cotton balls to replace periodically over the next few days. I was told my follow-up appointment would be in 2 weeks where the packing in my ear would be removed.At this point many people talk about being able to hear straight away. I can't say this was my experience, but I largely think this is due to the packing which is fairly tight in your ear. However, I did notice that scratching my ear lobe lightly produced a much louder sound than prior to the surgery which helped to give me some piece of mind that something has worked.Day 1 returning from surgery: Dizzy and tired. Dizzyness comes more from leaning head forward, leaning head backwards or going up and down stairs. This is a very common side effect of the surgery so I'm not worried at this point. I have to move in a more considered way but I don't think I'm at risk of falling over from this feeling of being off balance. There is some pain in the affected ear but it's not too bad. Had a big meal, watched some TV and then feel asleep on my back.Day 2: Just as dizzy as yesterday, cotton swab has a small amount of blood on it, ear pain definitely worse and can hear my heart beat/blood rushing sensation in my ear. None of this is unbearable and I still manage to talk to my sister on Facebook and listen to Adam Buxton's podcast. It's fairly embarrassing but one piece of advice I would give is get some 'stool softners' and or laxatives. A side effect of GA and pain medicine is constipation. Combine straining with a traumatised ear op and you have a fairly tricky pain balancing act while hovering over the toilet. Heed my words!Day 3: Bad night of sleeping waking up in pain. Think I'm trying to do to much to soon. No change in hearing, but I'm really not expecting anything until the packing is out. Felling generally a bit deflated after the GA and not being able to do anything active...I am not an indoors person. Had a dizzy walked to the shops looking like a drunkard.Day 4: slightly better sleep. Still some pain but I've only taken one ibuprofen today so it could definitely be worse. Still some minor bleeding on cotton swab. Ear continuing to make weird farting and squelching noises. I'm pretty relaxed that my ear is in recovery mode so I'm not expecting any miracles at this point. You'll read on other forums that some other people are already back to work at this point. This still feels some way off for me, but from what I've read about this procedure I can say for sure that everyone has very different recovery experience and associated timescales. Life can't be too bad as I've managed to write this post. Will update more over the coming days"
"Otitis Media","Hi guys, I'm new here.*So it all started in late December/early January. My roommates and I got flu-like symptoms. Fever, cough, mucus etc. Eventually we got over it. Or so I thought.*Fast forward to the tail end of January (27-28th). Started developing slight vertigo. It would come and go throughout the day (I mostly noticed it in closed corridors or whenever I showered).The vertigo eventually went away however after a few days. Weird.Fast forward a week later, maybe the 8th of February. I started developing ear fullness, and crackling. It was dull but constant . Eventually I got slight facial tension on my cheeks as well. No paralysis but almost like a sunburn or my face being pulled back.I spoke to my mother in law who's a nurse. She checked my ears and noticed they were swollen but no fluid. She suggested Motrin and Sudafed. Maybe it was sinus issue?I used it for one week straight. Didnt work.Eventually the vertigo came back. And now it came back even stronger. This was like the 14th of February.I started freaking out. I would get lightheaded out of nowhere and feel like passing out. My head felt so swollen. Almost as if someone wrapped a belt around my head. So I go to urgent care thinking Im dying. They checked my blood sugar. It was fine. Hemoglobin. Okay. Blood pressure? A little high due to panic attack.The urgent care doctor runs a basic neuro test on me...my finger following her finger, eyes following her finger etc. She checked my eyes and ears and her conclusion was... Migraine. Migraine...I've had migraines before. This did not feel like it.She prescribed me Sumatriptan for headaches and Zofran for nausea. It did not help so a few days later I went to the physician (17th of February).Physician ran the same test as urgent care doctor however he concluded I had middle/inner ear infection due to a virus that stuck around since January.He prescribed me ear drops, Meclizine for vertigo and Ibropufen.Now its been a few weeks since my appointment.My head still feels swollen but not as much during the day as before. Also, my facial tension has slightly diminished. Not as much vertigo. My eyes arent spinning anymore however I still have ear fullness and crackling.That being said, the odd thing is even though some symptoms are diminishing, I feel like I'm developing new symptoms.It almost feels like I am drowsy, drunk. I get tired very easily. Like I need to put my head down during the day.Also my heart rate would spike randomly. I could be resting at 60bpm then all of a sudden it can go to 90bpm as soon I start thinking about it.The best way to describe the feeling is like I have low blood sugar with high blood pressure.Secondly, I would get a throbbing sensation in hands and feet accompanied by cold sensations and pins and needles.Lastly, I feel like I can hear my heartbeat and it feels like its pumping harder.I'd like to note that all these symptoms come and go throughout the day. Some hrs are better than others but still constant every day.Doctor likes to say that its my anxiety due to panic attacks. He says it put a lot of pressure on my nerves. But I'm not sure.Its just so odd. I was perfectly fine leading up to the new year (working out 4 out of 7 days a week) then all of a sudden I'm having all these odd symptoms.Is the doctor right in saying this is an inner ear infection mixed with anxiety?Vestibular neuritis? Labyrinthitis?Its on my mind everyday. Maybe thats why I feel so fatigued?5'7 male29 years old175 lbsFilipino MexicanAny advice would be amazing. Thank you so much."
"Otitis Media","Hi All,I had an ear infection over 3 weeks ago which causes severe dizziness and hearing loss. The dizziness went away after a few days but I still feel unbalanced however I feel that is improving. During the first week my ear was completely blocked and had no feeling and couldnt hear anything.I got a hearing test and the audiologist said my hearing was profound loss. However since then I think my hearing has got better but not fully recovered. I saw an ENT they recommended I have a MRI which is soon. The last couple of weeks I have tinnitus which is really annoying me and I am worried. This is coming on to 4 weeks now. This started due to infection where my ear drum was inflamed after having a shower and during the night my ear got worse and worse.I saw my GP said last week my eardrum is no longer red but is dull, what does this mean?I am looking for advice and help with this. All comments will be appreciated highly as I am going through a very tough time as I am only 25."
"Otitis Media","I am a 33 year old female who has been struggling with PET for about five years now. I have tried gum chewing, saline, estrogen, patulend, and tubes with no success. I am now on my third ENT, who wants to do a nasal endoscopy and refer me to a neurotologist as well. A few questions. What will the neurotologist do? What happens if my ears aren't doing it when I have the nasal endoscopy? Any other temporary relief ideas (besides head between legs or laying down, because I can't do that at work)?"
"Otitis Media","hello.i have : Unilateral Tinnitus in left ear, Severe vertigo, a vague, dull, constant ache behind eyes, inside ear area, fullness, severe fatigue, sometimes I get sudden chills.once or twice lately ive woken up with numb fingers and i dont know whycan anyone help?"
"Otitis Media","Looking for an opinion on my last 2 years of being ill. I'm 46 years old, male, and in a good state of fitness. I'm not over-weight, have never smoked, and rarely drink.I've seen numerous doctors and don't seem to be any closer to a diagnosis. I started visiting my GP with what felt like a lingering flu. Early symptoms included being over tired, pressure in ears, and generally not feeling well. I'd been dealing with a very stressful business situation in the 12-18 months before the symptoms started and was advised that I was probably run-down. Each time I went to the doctor they would take a blood test. Over at least 6 tests they would always tell me something different, but it always seemed to be that I had some unknown virus. At times my blood cell count was too many white cells, or too many red cells. The frustration was they could never tell me what was wrong. I had stress tests for my heart, CT scan and MRI. All came back normal. During this period I would sometimes have 2-3 weeks where I felt normal and was able to work and exercise. These periods of good health never lasted. Fast forward to about 6 months ago. My [now new] doctor referred me to an endocrinologist as it was thought there may be a thyroid problem. My first test did indicate that I may be hypothyroid but they didn't want to give me any medication as they thought it wasn't required. I didn't get any better over the next few months with the same symptoms continuing - pressure in my head and ears, fatigued, unable to concentrate etc. At my next visit to the endocrinologist my thyroid function had worsened slightly and I was put on 50mg of euthyroxine. My blood pressure was also fluctuating a lot with periods where it was around 150/104. I was prescribed medication to try and bring this under control. Around 4 weeks ago I was on a trip away from home and started to feel really awful. I felt my head pressure was increasing and when I shut my eyes the only thing I could hear was my heart beating with a pulsing feeling my head. I had frequent hot flushes, dizzy spells, and never ending ear pressure. I was sleeping frequently for hours during the day, but struggling to get a good nights sleep, perhaps due to building anxiety about what was wrong with me.Now back home, I went back to the doctor and explained how bad I was feeling. The main symptoms now being extreme fatigue, constant pressure in my ears, and a very strange feeling at the top of my head. I felt on a few occasions that I was going to faint, especially in the morning. I had tried exercising [cycling] one morning, and had to abandon after only a short time. I had also started to feel aches and pains in my legs and back. I explained to the doctor that the main symptoms that were worrying me were the inability to work [tired and no concentration span], the pressure in my head and ears, and the strange pounding sensation from my heart. I was thinking at this time that these may all be connected to being hypothyroid. The doctor ordered a new thyroid function test which came back right in the middle of the normal range. That has scared me as I feel dreadful, and have been pretty much consigned to bed for the last week. When I do get up I feel dizzy. My eyesight has changed. Hard to explain but it's just not feeling normal. I also feel that driving has a different sensation and I don't feel entirely safe. I still have episodes of feeling like I will faint, but never do. My doctor had asked me to take Zoloft [as she felt I was over anxious]. I didn't want to take them but did, thinking it would do no harm. The morning after taking it I felt even worse, with the dizzy feelings increased. Even 2 days later I still feel the effects.I'm trying to find out what could cause my symptoms and came up with various reports onlabyrinthitis. As this seems to be a viral problem that can cause the feeling of ear fullness it seems to be a possibility. It's all I've come up now that it doesn't look thyroid is the source of the problem. Right now, I'm in the worst health I've been in years. I can't work, exercise and need to sleep 4-5 hours during the day. I have constant ear pressure, pressure in my head, dizziness, lack of energy, and muscle pain. Can anyone suggest what this could be. It's been 2 years now and I just seem to get worse. Writing this from bed as I don't seem to have the energy to stand up."
"Otitis Media","Two weeks ago I had a bad cold with chills and a fever that turned into a sinus and ear infection. The day I decided to go to the doctor I was experiencing severe sinus pressure. I moved my head in an awkward downward facing position and I felt liquid go into my ear. I tried shaking my head but it only made it worse and over the course of 2 hours the pain became unbearable. I tried using over the counter drops which only made it much worse to the point where I could not drive myself to the doctor.The doctor saw the fluid in my ear and said the ear was infected and gave me a 5 day course of antibiotics. I finished the antibiotics 3 days ago and my ear is still clogged (no pain) and ringing non stop.?I'm not sure if the clogged feeling is from fluid or inflammation/swelling. I no longer hear the fluid moving around when I move my head. I tried taking a nasal decongestant and ibuprofien for several days,I have used flonase and saline nasal spray every day. I tried a neti pot but the water kept just going down my throat.Any advice would be appreciated as I cannot go back to the doctor for another 5 days."
"Otitis Media","So I've been having headaches for 3 years now and It is driving me crazy. So to make a long story short I got tubes put in about 5 years ago and they seemed to be doing good so about a year and a half later they took both of them out because they needed to come out. No problems were there at all I was perfectly healthy and them after I got them taken out the ENT ordered a CAT Scan and they found there was a small cyst on the left side of my head something called a cholesteatoma which is probably from the scar tissue of the tubes when they did the surgery to put them in. Then I had to keep going to the ENT doctor about every 6 months and no problems were found anywhere I was living life normally and healthy. Then before I lost my medicaid I went back to the ENT and he said there was no need to do surgery, But he said if there are any problems later on go back and see him. So I couldn't go back to see him because I lost my medicaid and after a month and a half I started to get headaches, which I thought was a normal headache so I went through daily life, Then about 2 months after that I started to feel a little bit unsteady, I didn't think anything of it and I thought that would go away as well, then that persisted for about a year until I started to develop full body shaking and a burning to the left of my head I still get the burning sometimes. Then I developed confusion, concentration problems, brain fog, and dizziness (feels like I am on a boat). Then last year 2019 I went to get a neck MRI and they found a herniated disc on my c5-c6 cervical disc but I don't think that a cervical disk would cause all of these symptoms. I'm at my widths end with all of this so if anybody has any answers please tell me. At this point in time I'm losing trust in doctors for the sheer fact that they keep on sending me to random places and won't listen to me. But, Hopefully I can go back to my Primary Care Doctor to see what he can do for me."

"Otitis Media","Hi,I am a 33 years old female. I started to have this static sound in my ears from December 2019 and I have been referred to the ENT doctor, he checked me and I have done an audiology test and both ears where in normal hearing area but he said that the left ear how I get the sound it has a different shape (the line which shows on the audiology test) and he said that I need an MRI scan for the acoustic neuroma. I don't have any other symptoms apart from the tinnitus which drives me crazy in the night. Is it MRI safe? Are they gonna scan the whole head to check for tumor? If any of you experienced something similar please let me know. What are the chances to have a tumor? is it very common to be send for an MRI scan to exclude the tumor?If you found any remedies for the tinnitus please let me know too. I am very anxious as I have another problem apart from this, I am high myopic with astigmatism and it was enough with the eyes, now I have this problem, it's never ending ((Many thanks,Suzana"
"Otitis Media","I just turned 28, healthy female, I had a concussion last month and had times where i felt like i had vertigo. It has all passed and I'm feel alot better. Last night, I fell asleep on my couch, and woke up with my ear feeling like it needed to be popped. i couldn't get it to, I then start to feel pressure in my ear, not painful, just uncomfortable. there are times where it will pop a little, then feel like it needs to be popped again, it constantly feels like this.. It feels the same this morning. i went into the e.r who wrote of congestion, but i dont feel congested, i do have bad allergies. im just a little worried now. any opinions? i have a app with mt primary doc. anything i should ask for test to have her check for?"

"Otitis Media","hi everyone, it seems one thing after the other and this time it's absolutely terrifying. in late December i woke up to a sudden spinning sensation which was the same day i got bk from a funfair. i ended up going hospital in complete panic with anxiety. i had it for the next 6 weeks but more of a floating sensation followed by headaches which was occasionally, nausea and extreme tiredness. apart from the constant floating sensation i got the vertigo twice wen laying on my right side. this all disappeared for about 2 weeks until yesterday when i woke up to everything spinning again. i couldn't stand without falling. it lasted about 30mins but still have the dizziness on and off but better when I'm out. i also have a mild ringing noise in ears with what feels like fluid in my left ear but no deafness. i went to see my doctor who gave me nasal spray with steroids and appt to see a ENT doctor. when i have these episodes which I've only had about 3 in total i go into complete panic and jump up as it seems better when upright. can anyone give me advice on how to control these episodes without going into panic mode. I'm terrified these episodes won't pass unless i get up. I've also read these episodes of vertigo could last hours. I'm 42 advice and support much appreciated. i just hope its not the worst type if vertigo. could i have this permanently. not coping at all!"
"Otitis Media","IntroSo Ive been dealing with an issue for over a year now where my ears constantly pop (as if youre in an airplane). There is pain in my ears associated with the popping, and both occur constantly, all day, every day, nonstop. The popping started back in October 2016 and has been going on every single day since (I suspect it was from a flight I took a few months prior, but to be honest, its just a hunch. This whole thing really came out of nowhere). From what Ie gathered and due to symptoms, it seems to be Eustachian Tubular Dysfunction, but after meetings with ENT specialists and unsuccessful cure attempts, my doubts continue to linger. Its also been brought up that it could be TMJ, but due to the ear popping and pain, I would not think that would be the case. The popping is something I can deal with; the pain, however, is very bothersome and makes life quite miserable no matter what I do (its quite painful at times).Symptoms路 Ear popping: multiple times a minute (15, give or take. Fluctuates. Regardless, the point is that its A LOT). Typically, what happens is the right ear pops immediately followed by the left ear popping.路 Constant ear pain: the best way to describe it is a stinging pressure. Its as if something is inside my ears is trying to escape out of my eardrums. If I had to guess, the pain is mostly associated in my left ear (and if I had to guess even further, I want to say that my left Eustachian tube is blocked/pinched somehow, causing all of this). But either way, both ears experience pain and are equally discomforting.路 Throat pain: this is a bit odd, but I also feel pain/pressure in the very back of the throat. Its hard to describe, but it somehow feels related to it all and is in sync with this.路 No liquid/puss: There is no liquid buildup of any sort behind my eardrums, as observed by the ENT specialists. This has made tracking down the true cause quite difficult.路 Depression: Im typically a very happy dude. I know my mindset is all there, but this is finding ways to impede my emotions and lifestyle, and has succeeded in doing so.Attempted Remedies路 Flonase/nasal sprayo Also have used a corticosteroid & antihistamine spray multiple times路 Neti pot: of all the remedies, this seems to be on the best track of working. But still leads to a dead end路 Valsalva Maneuver (hold nose, then blow through nose): Ive done this hundreds of times, but its also recommended not to do. Ive not done it hard enough to rupture an eardrum/cause more damage, so no worries there路 Toynbee Maneuver (hold nose, close mouth, swallow): I have done this with water (also salt water)路 Earpopper: This is an FDA approved item that is basically a mechanized Valsalva Maneuver.路 ENT: Ive seen over 6 specialists, each with different approaches and guesses (one told me it would resolve itself within 1-2 months. You can imagine the frustration). After meeting with each person multiple times, they are baffled as what to do nexto One recommended an allergy test, I have yet to follow through with this路 CT Scan: I think this is what was done. It was performed at the ENT building.路 Myringotomy (small incision made into eardrum): performed on my left ear. No change in symptomso Also considered getting tubes put in, but didnt think it would be effectiveIm just desperate to figure out a cure. I truly think its something simple and we just have yet to discover the cause and relieve it. This constant pain makes the simplest of tasks very difficult for I have to really concentrate and motivate myself to push through the pain and keep moving on. If anybody at all can relate to this, or they think they have an idea of what may be happening here, I beg you to reach out with your suggestions. I all ears! Pun intended"
"Otitis Media","My ears leak at night time. As soon as I sleep they leak. They are very itchy.Been told that they are sweating! Didn't start until my late 30's.As soon as I am upright the leaking stops.Does anyone else have this issue?"
"Otitis Media","Hi all. Im looking for an answer or reason for what im experiencing with my hearing. I am currently under referral with an ENT how ever he is unaware of what im suffering with at the moment as he has cancelled appointments, ive tried to get all avenues to get to see him him but no joy. I just have to wait for the next appt which is in march. To cut a long story short, when i hear people talk or myself on the end of the sentance , it sounds TWANGY . When this started, id get a stuffy nose, pulsating in my right ear not my left and pain on and off, which i still do, the pulsating wore off when i went to the doctors as she gave me antibiotics but it flared up again, went away and over the last couple of days has come back the strange thing is ,what ever it is, it swaps ears and its never at the same time. backround noise, is the same but not TWANGY as it is when people speak. I have noticed to that i get a slight burring, i suppose more like a vibrating and this makes my ears more twangy. I take pain killers and it seems to work i think, but it doesnt get rid of the TWANG. Ive always had tinnitus so i know its not that . sorry if im babbling but im so depressed with it all now, its affecting everyone around me. Ive also had cholesteatoma which is why im under referral after care. If there is anyone else out there thats having or had the same thing as me, please let me know. my husband is taking me to A&E sat because i cant cope any more. Doctors dont take any notice and im at my lowest ebb. x"
"Otitis Media","Hi all,I'll try and break up my story:Myself:My name is Liam, 15. I am curious about something i have been able to do at will for many years, which is tense/flex a muscle inside my ear (which is what i assume it is).Backstory:I think it must have started when my grandad taught me to wiggle my ears, which i know is a fairly common ability. However it was through trying to do this that i think i found out my ""ability"".Explanation:While i tense this muscle, everything from breathing, chewing, humming is made much louder than normal. This includes my heartbeat, which i am usually able to hear at will by tensing this muscle in my ear. Strange, right! Quick Note: would like to point out that humming makes a far louder noise than anything else, (used this to my advantage to block out chewing sounds, very sure i have misophonia).Anyways, I was wondering if this is actually anything strange, or i am just exaggerating the situation. Looking forward to all replies!Thanks again!"
"Otitis Media","I had left ear stapedectomy on 21 December, I can feel improvement in my hearing however, I still feel dizzy while walking. Any such experiences."
"Otitis Media","For the past 3 or 4 months, EVERY SINGLE NIGHT (no exaggeration), when I lay down and go to sleep, I wake up to a horrific and loud and bothersome clicking in my right ear. Seems to be my right ear only although I believe on an occasion or two it might have switched to my left ear. I have included an audio file below, as I recorded the event to prove it was real. I went to 3 ENT doctors who did not believe me and told me I was imagining things and that this was normal. It is not normal to be jarred awake on a nightly basis and be sleep deprived for months. I am unable to be productive in life for the simple fact that I cannot sleep. How can I be imagining?something when Im asleep and having dreams. The only thing I should be imagining is riding a unicorn through rainbow clouds. The sounds occur with even the slightest movement of my head. I dont even have to swallow or jut my jaw to produce these effects.Ear Clicking Sounds - https://voca.ro/1kkNC3CPbTBLet me preface this with some further information, in case it may be relevant. I had my tonsils and adenoids taken out about 10 years ago. About 2 years ago I had a really bad sinus infection followed by a flu. Then I started a job at a call center. These 3 things happen all in a row. Since that time (I began the job) I noticed a sort of lump in my throat, almost like there was something stuck back there. I also found myself clearing my throat a lot, especially after eating and spitting out phlegm building in the back of my throat. This led me to think it was acid and so I tried months of long term and short term acid reducers like prilosec and pepcidAC?More annoying than my throat issues, I also began having ear pressure, pain, dizziness and congestion. The pain gives me a headache daily. On a normal basis, every time I swallow (even when I am not sick) I can hear the Eustacian Tubes popping very loudly, and I have constant feeling of congestions (even though my audio and pressure tests appear normal and there is no sign of fluid buildup according to docs). Now this is slightly different to the sounds that occur at night, as those usually occur after Im laying down or sleeping for a bit, and isnt AS bothersome. I have the exact symptoms of when I do have a sinus infection. I've tried diet, exercise, no dairy (I do drink pop) sinus/allergy meds, flonase, acid reducers, notepad, ear wax removal kits, plugging nose and blowing out ears. Nothing helps. Plz help!"
"Otitis Media","Hi AllA couple of days ago my right ear started to get a sensation of feeling full, then a bit later that same day my hearing went all muffled in that the same ear. Since then the feeling of fullness has got worse, and my lack of being able to hear has got worse. Every now and again I hear and feel crackling / popping sensations in that ear, and if I press on the skin where my ear canal is I get a horrid squelching sound. It doesn't hurt at all under normal circumstances, but after a while of eating I can get a mild sharp pain with each jaw movement. I feel fine otherwise, not experiencing any other unusual symptoms, and my left ear is totally fine.Does anyone have any ideas what this is and what could be causing it, and if you know of any methods that might help clear it. I'm reluctant to use over the counter ear cleaning remedies as they aren't supposed to be used if the ear drum is damaged and I'd rather not take the risk. I also had that ear syringed not that long ago so it surely can't be wax build up in such a short space of time, however I could be wrong.Any thoughts and advice would be greatly appreciated."
"Otitis Media","Hello back in April I was in the ER due to extreme abdominal pain, been through labor and this was worse. Also unstoppable vomiting... my wbc was at 15,300 but went home and was fine. After that I noticed a couple petechiae pots on my face but nothing crazy. Recently I have had spots on my inner a (pic included) no trauma to area. Also a few days ago i deceloped a textured hot rash on my face that i have had maybe 2 times in my childhood. Also my legs have bruises on them constantly but i dont take it to serious because ive always bruised like this...but i also have a couple of small bruises bigger than petechiae but purpulish and one more thing ive noticed i cant remember things that i just heard or got asked to do and my husband has noticed it to and jokes that i have short term memory loss. But im worried i may have a blood disorder but i dont want to go back to the dr because i feel like they wont do anything and i dont want to pay for nothing.. but i am kind of nervous.

"Otitis Media","Hi,Has anyone experienced a loud roaring low frequency noise in ear with hearing distortion. I woke up one morning in December of 2015 and felt like there was a gong in my head all sound was vibrating. I felt like I was in the front seat of a car driving down the highway with the back windows open halfway. I went to doctor and found I had lost some low frequency hearing in right ear. I was Put on steroids for two weeks. Got hearing back but left with this loud tuning fork/motor engine sound in my right ear and random hearing distortion in both ears. I am very sensitive to low-frequency sounds and any kind of motors, airplanes and low voices just don't sound clear. The motor engine stops when I speak and returns after my last word. When someone speaks to me loud enough the motor engine will stop also and than return upon their last word. Sometime sound drives the motor engine into the other ear and I feel a fluttering/vibration/rumbling sound in the left ear. If I shake my head back and forth quicky the noise will stop for a second wihile doing it.Had so many tests and scans that don't show anything wrong. My hearing test are normal now. It is driving me insane. Can't eat or concentrate. Severe anxiety. Went to audiologist and see if I could have it masked but it is to loud. I can't believe I can still hear over this noise and distortion that is going on in my head. Some days are better than others and I think I may be getting better but it gets worse again. I have no dizziness at all. Some doctors told me menieres disease or virus. I can't stand it anymore. Does anyone have any suggestions?"

"Otitis Media","hello everyone,I did my surgery 8 days ago in my left ear. I felt dizzy for the first 4 days or so yet it was not too bad. there was pai especially at night. I had to continue taking pain killers for the first 5 days but after that the pain almost went away.my worry is that i was so hopeful to experience the loud sounds after surgery. it did not happen. I removed the pack yesterday and still the hearing did not improve nor got worse.My ear feels blocked and the heartbeat sound never stopped since I woke up from surgery till now. I removed the pack yesterday and also.did not notice an improvement. the dr. said it is because of all the fluids that needs to be absorbed/dry out....... quite frankly I am getting more anxious and rather depressed that my OP did not go well.my doctor told me right after surgery that there were no complications and that the surgery went well.your feedback is so highly appreciated"
"Otitis Media","From December 2018 to September 2019, i went from mild to moderate/severe hearing loss in my left ear. I went to an ent who told me it was a sudden loss and probably due to a viral infection. He booked me an mri and it is not until Jan 7.This week I have lost more hearing. I went to the ER and was given steriods. The ENTs there would not set me up for a scan and said it is more of a gradual loss and they can't help me. I was told to call my ENT on Monday. I tried calling him for days but couldnt get a hold of him. My family doctor told me to go to the er.i also have a white patch on my left eardrum. Nobody call tell me what it is. I am p****d off that I am not being taken seriously. I have sensory hearing loss and my face twitches on my left side. I also have pain in my ear.Has anyone had this happen to them? What was the outcome? I have gradual unilateral sensory hearing loss. No one can tell me what is going on."
"Otitis Media","It started a few months ago.Went to the doc recently and they gave me antibiotics thinking it was sinus infection.When I went to the doc I didn't have any congestion other than ears popping and feeling full but never felt the need to blow my nose...etc.I've just finished the antibiotic cycle and although my ears aren't getting bright red anymore they still feeling like they are on fire and the areas around my ears feel very warm. Nose is stuffy now that I've stopped the antibiotics, ears are popping still and feel full.If I apply an ice pack to my ears, cheeks and back of my neck the heat goes away but will return shortly after I stop using the ice pack.The above symptoms will go away randomly and I'll feel fine for 6-10 hours and then it all comes back. A slight headache / uncomfortableness in my forehead and top of my head on occasion.Sometimes nausea but no vomiting. And on occasion dizzy spells.When I blow my nose mucus is clear as day. Started using a humidifier which seemed to help a little but not much.I've not had a temperature at all during any of these bouts and I don't feel fatigued or worn out.It's seriously driving me crazy. Anyone help?!?!?"
"Otitis Media","has anyone had ear deafness but dr says theres no wax that he can see. its worrying me and also really getting me down as I can barely hear anything. my ears feel full and they have also been itching with a bit of buzzing."
"Otitis Media","I have been having this constant tingling for 3 months now just outside my ear. It started just happening very slightly in one place every now and then. It has now moved more towards the hole in my ear and the tingling has grown and now never stops. I have been to an ENT doctor who prescribed me ear drops saying my ear canal was dry and could be the reason for the sensation. Even though the feeling isn't coming from inside my ear. The drops did nothing as i expected them to. I have tried to search anything on my symptoms across the internet and have found more than enough people with the exact symptoms of ants running around the outer part of the ear but no real conclusion. Please anyone help! The only time i get any relief is when i open my jaw wide and it only last for just a few seconds. Could this be a connection? I'm going to have an MRI scan on my brain next week because i am desperate. I used to wear ear plugs every night because i live in close encounters with my family and sleeping is important to me. I stopped thinking that could be the cause but it has gotten worse and even with the ear plug i can still feel the ""ants"" in my ear which is a very disturbing sensation. If anyone can help shed any light to this strange situation, you will forever be in my utmost appreciation."
"Otitis Media","I saw my gp about it last year, it's been on and off for about 3 years now since I had some pins and needles dizziness and fainting sensation last 2016.Had nasal sprays for it, didn't work. my gp looked inside my ear again, but couldn't see anything, and told me it could be because my eustachian tube not opening and closing properly which is common with cleft palate and lop sided nose and there's little that can be done about it.This year it has been constant, just a mild sensation in my ear, sometimes it mildly aches. it crackles a lot, even when jumping or running.Chewing does nothing.it causes pressure and tension in my head and eyes, when I touch something or carry something I sometimes feel the weird sensation in my ear, like my brain is focusing on my ear (really hard to explain, even to the doctor)..sometimes I get a sudden humming or ringing in the ear for a few seconds.I don't know what to do anymore, I feel fed up of feeling like this.could whatever caused those sensations back in 2016 be linked to these feelings?I can only hear in one ear and never had trouble with it in the past.I have anxiety and depression and managing that.Some things non related make me just cry, and I feel crying gets rid of the feeling for a while."
"Otitis Media","Just wanted to know if anyone has had this problem?? Been to about 5 or 6 doctors, hearing is OK but this person is still saying there's a problem. I think it's an anxiety issue but I'm not a doctor. I'm at my wits end and don't know what to do.. ; ("
"Otitis Media","I've been playing and singing in a band for over ten years (with earplugs) but recently i've started having a strong buzzing inside my left ear whenever I sing particularly high/loud notes.

Does anyone know what it could be?I've also had brain fog/spaced out/blurry vision for about 2.5 months.Thanks for any advice."
"Otitis Media","Does anyone have experience with grommets?I had a blocked left ear for 5 weeks that would not clear despite multiple medications ( sudafed, prednisone, nasonex, nasal decongestants etc). My left ear had blocked up after a sore throat/ sinus congestion. My right ear stayed clear.Both my general practioner and ENT said no infection however the ENT suggested a left ear grommet due to the lack of clearing and the fact that it had happened earlier in the year under similar circumstances, although for only 3 weeks on and off.Well i had the grommet inserted under anaesthetic last week. Immediately upon waking from the procedure my ear still felt blocked as well as my right!!The ENT is not sure why and had no explanation but sent me for a hearing test. I told him that I can hear but just feel blocked with a muffled sensation in both ears. My hearing test came back normal as I knew it would however it has been 7 days and the blocked feeling persists in both ears. I feel worse now then before the procedure.Can anyone tell me if this blocked sensation will go away and how long I should expect it to last. I feel as if I am going crazy and my ENT just tells me not to worry because my hearing is normal."
"Otitis Media","Hi there,I had my stapedectomy operation done in December 2006 and thought I'd share my experience with anyone who might be considering this operation and sprawling patient forums as I did.I was 60% deaf in my right ear and had early signs of otosclerosis in my left ear. I decided to go ahead with the opeartion largely because insurance doesn't cover hearing aids. My specialist was Mr. J A Lavy who I can't recommend enough. He explained that there was a 1% chance of total hearing loss and 10% chance that my hearing wouldn't improve and as others have mentioned they may not be able to do the operation should my facial nerve be in the way.I had the operation done under local anaesthetic and was also given a sedative. I have to say the most painful part of the whole experience was the injections in my ear but they are over in a matter of minutes. Unfortunately my ear canal was too narrow so they had to make an incision in the top of my ear but that really wasn't a big deal and has left the tiniest of scares. I watched the operation as it was being done through their camera which was quite reassuring as there were a lot of loud noises as they chipped away at bone etc. I fell asleep as they were doing the laser bit and came round after they had sewn up my ear drum. The advantage of them doing it under local was that they could do a mini test on my hearing there and then.I felt extremely dizzy after the op - don't underestimate how dizzy u'll feel. I think that it is a little under played on a lot of these sites about how rotten you'll feel for the next day or so. I ended up staying in the hospital overnight. My recovery took a week and it was a week of very squelchy noises, having to have someone wash my hair (you musn't get it wet) and restless nights as obviously it's too painful to lye on the operated ear.Once the padding came out (2 weeks) everything was defeaningly loud and had a tinny quality about it but that settled down over the following two weeks. But I would be prepared to negotiate your social life for this period as I found that going out a bit of an overwhelming experience as I found my sense of sound direction was completely off. Yesterday I had my hearing tested, you have to wait 6 weeks in total before it's testable, the results were fantastic I now have a normal right ear and can use the phone on that ear and hear what people are actually saying rather than just pretending to understand. There is a small chance that I may have to have the piston replaced years from now as I am only 25 and so it may wear out also I may need to have the left ear operated on in time but I don't see this as a major issue considering how well my first op went.The things that I have been told I wont be able to do post op is scuba diving and sky diving (shucks!)Well that's it - hope that's helpful![i:0f5ba42d8b]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:0f5ba42d8b]"
"Otitis Media","My son has an odd looking swelling on the inside of his ear. Does anyone know what it is and what might have caused it?"
"Otitis Media","long story short-After a bout of nasty colds that wouldn't shift, I ended up with ear pressure and a little pain (although the pain wasn't that bad and was on and off). I saw a doctor who said I had a double ear infection (redness in both ears as well as a swollen/bulging eardrum). a week of antibiotics later and the redness is gone but the ear drum is now 'sucked in' and the blocked ear feeling was still there. the doctor said my eustachian tube is still blocked but I need to give it more time. a couple of weeks later and here I am. over the last couple of days I have started to notice less of a blocked feeling-it came and went before so it was hard to say to start with whether it's a definite improvement but after a few days I think it is improved the only thing I have noticed is that since the blocked feeling eases off, the slight achey feeling in my ear has increased. I didn't know if maybe this is just because things are starting to open up. I would assume the ears wouldn't be getting less blocked if overall the ear problem is getting worse. is this maybe just a natural progression or does this happen with blocked eustachian tubes-in that it comes and goes and maybe it's not improving any input appreciated!"

"Otitis Media","Hi,I'm considered to have very good and rather sensitive hearing and don't want to damage my ears. But I do volunteer work for the melodic caring project and we broadcast live gigs to children's hospital, the last gig was in a local pub and I felt the urge to get away from the sound of the gig every 10 to 15minutes and after it I suffered tinitus for the next 24hours or so, which was not pleasant. I really like the charity and what we do, but do not want to damage my ears again, the next concert is in a big rock venue, which I imagine will be even louder. What's your best advise for protecting my ears from the loud noise exposure?"
"Otitis Media","Hello! I have a rather specific question about an ear problem that I have had for the past couple weeks, and had also experienced several years ago. There is a swollen area on the cartilage area. Here is a picture where the left side is the unaffected ear and the right side is the affected ear.In case the link doesn't work, I have provided the photo here as well:Six years ago I had this same problem on both ears (thankfully this time it is just one of them). Both times were caused by rubbing and itching my ear, and I am unable to anticipate under what circumstances it will start to swell. Last time I got it checked out by an ear doctor and turns out the swollen parts were filled with blood, so the doctor drained my ears. Then he completely bandaged my head (to keep pressure) and it was really embarrassing so I would rather not have to do that again.Asking for your opinions and expertise - does this seem like something serious that I have to get checked out?"
"Otitis Media","i just has a stapedectomy on my right ear today. I wasn't paying attention and blew my nose about 5 hours after my surgery. I have no extra drainage other than what was already occurring, and the static noises i was hearing before I blew my nose didn't change. I'm freaking out hoping i didn't cause the implant to shift or something that will cause my surgery to not be effective or worse. Anyone else accidentally pop their ear soon after their surgery and end up okay?"
"Otitis Media","hello. i have had a cold for the past week, and last night i started feeling relief from the head/ear pressure. at the same time I developed a squeaky, whistling noise in my left ear, it's just like a bird chirping. I've never experienced this with a cold before and it is worrying and annoying. is this normal?"
"Otitis Media","Hi. Please can someone help me with my request? My daughter is 16 years old and had glue ear when she was 3. Aged 7 she had grommets and for 4 years she had pain and infections in her right ear. Eventually the surgeon at the time took the grommets out when she was about to start secondary school - the left being fine and came out easily but the right had embedded itself and left a significant hole in her ear drum. 3 months after the operation she went back for a check up and the healing process had not begun so the surgeon cauterised the tissue with silver nitrate. She was very brave and in floods of tears because of the pain. We felt this particular surgeon was not particularly communicative and felt his bedside manner was abrupt so we then decided to get a second opinion as to what to do and saw a senior consultant at the same hospital . This surgeon was very communicative and pleasant to deal with so we were all in agreement she should go for the above surgery under this consultant/surgeon. This operation is called ""right cartilage tympanoplasty"" and the operation took place in April 2017. At the time, he was honest and upfront about the op and wasn't sure whether the graft would take or not. Sadly, it didn't because he was trying to graft skin onto the cauterised tissue which was very hard and bone like. So now we are back to square one with the same operation to be performed under the same surgeon. I have made appointment to express my concerns to this surgeon but I would also like to get another opinion but now running out of ideas where to go or who is a top surgeon. Can anyone help me with my request for a good surgeon who will reassure me?"
"Otitis Media","Hello for over a year now I've had this hearing loss and the ENT has not helped or prescribed me anything. I'm wondering if anyone has experience with this and what I can do to improve my hearing? I also have TMJ, a deviated septum, Eustacian Tube Dysfunction, Tinnitus and a canted jaw. I'll give myself a year to adjust to this but as a music lover this has taken the meaning from my life and no one seems to think it's a big deal. I'd much rather lose an arm or leg."

"Otitis Media","Hi all.i had double jaw surgery 6 weeks ago and ever since i have had issues with my ears.Every time i swallow they pop and make a crackling sound, i sound loud and echoy when i talk and sometimes they ""pop"" and i can hear myself in my own head - my breathing, heart beat and my own voice sounds like im in a vacuum - like if you were to put your fingers in your ears or hands on your ears and speak.My ears crackle and click every time i swallow, i constantly sound nasally and echoy and only occasionally (like 3-4 times a week for a few minutes) do my ears ""pop"" and i get the sensation of being trapped in your own head hearing your breathing and voice. I stop this by bending down and putting my head between my legs.does anyone else have these symptoms??"
"Otitis Media","Hi ,This is the 4 th day after surgery and i still feel weak and numb in my body.CONCERN : As per my ENT my ear canel was very small and it took 3 hrs for the surgery to get done.In the process doctor when trying to implant the stap (which is made of tatinium and plastic ) fell down and they could not take it out and left it inside. He used another prosthatic and completed the surgery. he mentioned the object is harmless and is behind my eardrum. IS THIS REALLY OK? if i need that to be removed ear has to be cut from back is what was said.I Dont feel myself yet . very low energy and feels likes liquid is filled inside which feels totally heavy and muted .thank you"
"Otitis Media","just started this morning. I will get very brief nerve-like pain along the outer edge of my left outer ear at irregular intervals. the pain lasts just a second but is extremely intense. THE FUNNY THING IS THAT IF I SQUEEZE MY EARLOBE HARD THE PAIN WILL STOP. AS LONG AS MAINTAIN THE PRESSURE THE PAIN STAYS AT BAY.Any ideas?THANKS?"
"Otitis Media","Every now and then I get a sharp ear pain in my outer ear (pinna) area. It is a quick sharp stabbing pain that happens every minute or so. It can last a day, a few hours or even 2 days and will come back randomly, like weeks or even a month or so. No piercings except on my lobes, I'm starting to wonder if its stress related? Not sure though, wondering if anything else has had the same thing as I can't find much on a simple google search."
"Otitis Media","Recently i caused damage to my ear drum by poking an cotton bud too far down my ear. I had real bad pain for about 4 days but the pain has cleared up now. However a large amount of wax is still in my ear and is causing my right ears hearing to be a little off. This is really annoying considering I make music and need both ears in good condition. I was wondering whether it would be safe to use hydrogen peroxide to clear up the wax as apparently with ear damage it can cause pain but the pain from before has faded"
"Otitis Media","Hi AllJust wondering if anyone knows what this tickling sensation I have in my left ear could be.It started as soon as I woke up this morning, it is not a constant tickling, happening only now and again, and with that I sometimes get this crackling, squelching noise in my ear canal when I move my jaw in a certain way. There is no pain at all, hearing is fine, I'm not having any other symptoms, just a tickling sensation, and the tickling and crackling noises seem to be coming from nearer the entrance to the ear canal, not deep inside the ear.I'd be very grateful to hear any thoughts and comments on what this might be."
"Otitis Media","I just started noticing that when i smile big or laugh my i can hear that good untill i stop smiling it sounds like when you get water in your ears and your hearing is worse until you get the water out is you get what im saying it feels like that anyone else feel the same ? Should i be worried?"
"Otitis Media","Hello,This is my first time one the forum, so I want to thank everyone in advance for their advice.It is pretty hard to explain, but last November while I was in a pretty stressful time at college, I noticed that my right ear would vibrate sometime to the external sounds around me. This almost felt as if the sound waves were being amplified in my right ear. I concluded that it was not something like tinnitus because it seemed to only react to external sounds. If I wore earplugs or covered my ears, the vibration would go away. Further I could hear my tinnitus along side these vibrations in my right ear.Anyway fast forward until now, I am feeling pretty helpless and anxious as I do not know the problem. I am hoping that this is not forever as that would suck. I have been to a ENT who has conducted a hearing and a vestibular test, which all came normal. He mentioned that he could not help me further and that I should consult a neurologist.Let me know your thoughts on this and I will be actively clarifying any questions!Thanks again! "
"Otitis Media","Hi,I've been having ear problems from September 2016 that started with some progressive tinnitus in my left ear that lead to severe hearing loss over 2 years and I'm now practically deaf in my left ear. No doctor was able to diagnose what was wrong with me and any medication prescribed didn't work. It was a hassle to go through but I eventually adapted to it. But what was weird was that I experienced pretty much no pain at all in my ear and doctors looked into my ear and said there was no problem with it.About 4 weeks ago, I suffered an uncomfortable popping noise in my right ear while I was on a jetski. I immediately had hearing loss along with a high amount of pressure in both ears and went to a doctor for treatment. It turns out that I have severe inflammation in my sinuses and my left ear may have been preforated at some point and I have scaring in both my ears. I was given prednisone and an antibiotic which helped me to get a bit better after a week. But a week after that, it started again with a high amount of pressure and immediate hearing loss. I felt liquid going down my ear and couldn't unblock my Eustachian tube but I didn't experience any pain apart from the discomfort of the pressure in the middle ear. It's been just over a week since then and I've suffered progressive hearing loss each day. Doctors believe I have chronic Rhinitis and Eustachian tube dysfunction and have given me nasal sprays but they aren't working at all and I can't get an appointment with a consultant until October as they're fully booked. Does anyone have any advice on how I can at least reduce my symptoms?"
"Otitis Media","My wife, age 24, has been having issues with hearing in her left ear for about a week and a half. She describes it as a kind of echo which is more pronounced at certain pitches. For instance, if I say ""good morning"", she will hear it normally in her right ear, but her left ear will hear it normally and then hear it once again pitched up. She describes it as the sound a child's toy microphone makes when you speak into it and the spring inside reverberates. We initially thought it was from sinus buildup she was having due to allergies but that has been ruled out. She went to an urgent care last week and they said her ears looked normal. They administered a steroid shot but so far there is no change in her condition. She also got adjusted by a chiropractor and it did not affect her condition. The next step is to go to our primary care physician (Tricare) and get her a referral to an ENT. This may take up to 4 weeks from the time of the appointment. At this point it is causing her added stress and anxiety. She works in a children's museum but shouldn't have been exposed to any noises loud enough to cause any sort of hearing damage. If any medical professionals can offer their opinion as to what may be causing this and how it may be treated we would greatly appreciate it. Thank you."
"Otitis Media","3 weeks ago I had a cold and one night I woke up in extreme pain in my left ear, ever since it's been blocked. I know all the medical reasons as to why it's blocked but I can't seem to unblock it. I went to the hospital to see professional help and they just gave me antibiotics and said I have sinusitis. I feel like the antibiotics have made it worse. My right ear became blocked too but thankfully it got unblocked as that ear seems to be popping fine but it's gotten to a stage where a simple swallow makes my right ear pop and whenever I only begin to breathe out my nose whilst pinching it shut, my right ear constantly pops like crazy for 10 seconds and when I stop it pops again constantly for a short time. It's gotten to a stage where the pops are actually painful and I'm afraid it's going to affect my hearing. My left ear is in a constant state of being just blocked and feeling intense pressure and pain as well but bearable pain very odd to describe. The left ear pops maybe once or twice a day but it doesn't feel like the ear opens up at all. I'm very concerned about my situation and I would like to see if anyone has any ideas."
"Otitis Media","IVE had this for a while,i have a squelching noise in both ears and they block up now and again,its like when u get water in your ears. .Ive seen a ENT specialist and he said everythings fine,any ideas people?"
"Otitis Media","I've been trying to get to the bottom of this and I've asked on other forums but got no replies. I am hoping to get some replies here.I am 25. For 11 years straight, I have had problems with my right ear since I got an ear infection after a bout of flu. In recent years however my symptoms have worsened exponentially and it is getting me very concerned.The ringing in my right (bad) ear is constant. I get episodes of ear pain which rivals that of wisdom tooth pain - enough to make me physically cringe. Something I feel like is a big clue to all this is my symptoms reduce to around 10% after I have slept - as in, lied down on my left side (the side I normally sleep on) motionless for 8 hours. I will go into a quiet room and the tinnitus is barely even there, but shortly after, it will come back again, and so will the balance problems, pain, and the inability (or extreme difficulty) to pop my right ear.My hearing is normal and an MRI revealed no lesions. I have been seeing doctors about my ear since 2017 now, and pretty much every time they look into my right ear, there is something abnormal about it. It is either ''retracted'', ''very dull'', or there's loads of fluid behind my eardrum.My balance problems and tinnitus are worst at night, or whenever I have been up for a long time. I cannot balance on one leg at all now, or I fall over. I've tried. When I was younger I could balance on one leg with no problems at all. Nasal sprays don't seem to do anything.One doctor mentioned grommets, but nothing was done. I've been referred to one of the top ENT's in the country but I've been left in the dark about that and I have no idea when I will see him. My doctor recently prescribed me sedatives for my ear a week ago, but they do not help much with the ringing. She said if they aren't working, then I should call the clinic to talk to her over the phone.Another thing that is concerning me are personality changes and feeling unwell all the time. I always feel lethargic, and my white blood cell count was low last time I had a neutrophil blood test. I also find myself feeling very restless and irritable so I'm wondering if this could be related to my ear.I would very much appreciate answers as this has caused me so much depression and misery throughout my teenage years and now my adult years. I cannot get a job or work because I cannot sleep."
"Otitis Media","Hi,For the last month I have been experiencing what started as a feeling of ""pulses"" in my ear. Sort of like when you hear your heart punding only its not the heart (its a very quick and disordered feeling which is unrelated to the pulse).After seeing a physician he said its an ear infection and gave me antibiotic drops. after finishing the treatment and going back to another physician, I was sent to an ENT doctor that gave me steroids. after these also didnt help, I went to an ENT specialist (who is a throat expert but agreed to see me anyway).By that point, the feeling of fullness in my ear was worse, and now any time I do any activity that involves pressure on the throat (swallowing, burping, yawning etc) I can really feel pressure in my ear along with hearing a ""popping"" sound, something like bubbles in my ear.So, the ENT said something very weird after looking in my ear - he said there's nothing wrong with it and that it's a form of Tinnitus.This sounds off to me - I know about Tinnitus, and the symptoms I have can be triggered by flexing my jaw or swallowing. its sounds nothing like the Tinnitus I know about.Does anyone here have any insights? should I be satisfied by his analysis or should I search for another doctor?Thank you "

"Otitis Media","My right ear has been driving me absolutely bonkers with this ""clack"" ""crack"" ""pop"" sound whenever I twitch the side of my face or swallow. The ear itself doesn't hurt, but I do get pain on the side of my face. The pain is manageable with a painkiller and isn't severe. What bugs me is this popping, because I already have sensory issues, so the noise is very aggravating and painful to hear. (I am autistic.) I just want to hear silence again. My ear itself works fine, it's just this popping that bugs me."
"Otitis Media","3 months ago my right ear started to feel full, clogged and ring when is quiet. I visited an ent specialist right away. She cleaned my ear and prescribed me ear drops. My ear started to get worse and now both ears ring and feel clogged. I went to another doctor recently and she said if you had a flu before it might of affected the ears and there is nothing I can do. I'm starting to get worried because everyday it gets worse and I don't know what to do and it's been 3 months"

"Otitis Media","HiLike the title says I had a L side modified mastoidsectomy and tympanoplasty surgery to basically get a functioning ear back.Background: I went to Kenya on safari. 16 flights, last 4 flights I had blood from nose and ear. At the hotel I went in the swimming pool for 10 seconds and got a very resistant pseudomonas A ear infection.Flew back and my eardrum ruptured 2 times in the same ear.6 months of treatment for chronic infection didnt work... the infection was literally pouring out of my ear, even the surgeons were shocked.Just after new year 2019 I became severely unwell throughout the night, by 11am I was unable to walk 5 yards without panting for breath. My ear was also bleeding.Saw my Dr urgently and my temp was 39.7, HR 159 , severe back pain and I hadnt urinated for 26 hours and he said it was Sepsis. Got to the hospital and waited for 20mins, nurses redone my observations and my temp had risen to 40.2 my HR was 170+ and my blood was a thick gungy black ... I was admitted as Sepsis given IV Tazocin, pain relief, fluids...Dr said I was in circulatory failure, my kidneys were shutting down and basically if I had waited until the next day before coming into hospital (original plan) I probably would have died.Saw the surgeons at another hospital and they expedited surgery as an outpatient. Had the surgery done in March 2019. 4hr surgery, was discharged with no pain relief so after 2 days I was in so much pain I had to present at urgent care centre where the medical team were shocked as I had blood dripping everywhere and I was in too much pain to care about it. They gave me an overdose really, morphine liquid form and 2x 60mg codeine with anti sickness too.NOW:My ear is still sore, still feels like its bulging.The nerves are all shot around the L side of my entire head, face and neck. When I touch my skin I know it is smooth but I have an internal noise of really hard horrible sandpaper.Also, Ive been using decongestants since the surgery. I recently had 4 flights (surgeon was happy all was good to fly). My ear did not equalise the pressure... it did nothing apart from bulge a lot and feel sore.Im worried about the pressure not equalising because I have a lot of flights and it happens on trains and even on bridges too... I worry it will perforate the eardrum again.Should I give this more time to heal or is 4-5 months enough time?"
"Otitis Media","Hello,I am due to have a revision mastoidectomy and obliteration in 6 weeks time.I know all about the operation however I was wondering if anybody else has had this done and how long recovery was.Trying to work out roughly how long I will need off work.Many thanksSam"
"Otitis Media","I'm new here, I feel this is a last resort since I cannot get any answers anywhere. I'm 32, male.On August 11th, 2018 I had a sudden sharp drop in my hearing in my right ear. It felt like something, such as wax (which I have a long history of) got clogged in there. Over time, I started using the usual wax removal drops to no avail. Since it didn't work, I went into an immediate care facility to hopefully have that removed.Ruptured eardrum they said. I had medication given. The ruptured eardrum went away but the hearing never came back. It feels full, lot of pressure still. Every now and then I get an itching, oozing feeling from the ear.I went to an ENT (Ear, Nose, Throat) specialist in November. He could find nothing wrong. Nothing. Zip. They took a hearing test. Nothing wrong with my hearing (At least per the test) but it sure seems like it. I do not hear from my right ear as well as my left since this happened. He left me with a nasal spray. It did not help at all.I then went to my PCP (Primary Care Provider) she finally gave me a lead ""There is fluid in your ear. Take claritin"" I took what she told me, it didn't stop completely. There was minor improvement but only for a short time and that was only for the pressure. I went back to her for a follow up and she said ""Ah there's no fluid in your ear anymore"" and I told her that I'm still having hearing problems and she suggested I was having anxiety.Earlier this month, not feeling like giving up, I went into another immediate care facility. The lady told me that my sinuses were extremely inflammed. Fluid in both of my ears. Follow up with an ENT. She suggested the same nasal spray that the ENT gave me.I went back to the ENT last week. He looked in my ears and my nose ""There is no fluid, nothing. No inflammation"" Referred me to get a CT scan which I have to wait for my insurance to approve.In addition, in recent weeks my right eye has been sort of blurred, feeling a lot of pressure behind the eye and the ear.Is there something some doctors can see and others cannot? It makes no sense why I could go to several doctors, some not seeing a thing, including specialists in the field and others seeing something wrong. It all seems to be concentrated to the top right of my forehead. That's where I feel the most pressure. I'm extremely worried now that the vision is starting to bother me. I feel hopeless."
"Otitis Media","it started 3 weeks ago with blocked ears and now it's an almost constant vibrating like noise down my ear. I have an ear infection and was prescribed antibiotics spray Tuesday now Friday and still hasn't cleared it. I do have antibiotics which I'm very nervous about taking (amoxicillin). I seen a different doctor today who said continue with the ear spray although the last doctor said it would be better to take antibiotics. feeling confused as to what to do. I literally cant take this anymore its causing me severe anxiety and worry."
"Otitis Media","I have got pretty bad one sided deafness - have been to ENT who have found out it's not an acoustic neuroma - and aside from telling me they will give me a hearing aid - they are sending me to see neurology. I do have the occasional dizzy spell- and I am pretty clumsy and unsteady on my feet - but I also have issues with my tongue (it gets randomly sore) and things taste funny - to the point I have gone off a few things I used to love!

"Otitis Media","For as long as I can remember, several times a month I will wake with intense, stabbing ear pain. It is so bad that i cannot even move my head. I have to use my hands to very slowly turn my head. This happens in both ears. I'm a side sleeper. the pain starts in the ear on the side that i am sleeping on. When I am able to turn my head with my hands and switch sides I will go back to sleep, but the pain will move to that ear and i will wake up again. After a night of this, the pain remains throughout the day and slowly subsides. I can go a few nights or a few weeks without it happening. It's been at least 3 times a month for as long as I can remember fir 36 years. I have never been able to find a diagnosis. There is no remedy that works. The pain is so intense. Has anyone else experienced this or know what is going on? I'd love some direction!"
"Otitis Media","I had progressively blocked ears after getting a few viral colds back to back a few months ago. I saw a doctor who said it was a double ear infection and gave me antibiotics which after a week had reduced the redness and swelling in my ears but they stayed blocked. the blockage was on and off rather than constant and i just had a bit of pain every now and then. it seems to be improving recently with less blockage and pain but every now and then i still get what sounds like water in my ear. it tends to be when I tilt my head and open and shut my mouth. does anyone else get this? I am going back to see the doctor next week but it would be good to know if other people get this and if theres anything I can do to help it. TIA"
"Otitis Media","Hi- I'll be quick with this. I have lost hearing on one side, have tinnitus, unsteady sometimes too, woolly head often. Had ears tested etc at ENT - they have referred me for a non-urgent MRI brain scan - and told me If it is a acoustic neuroma it grows really slowly and not to panic. I should get an appointment by 6 weeks from initial hearing test. How can I not worry???? How long has anyone else had to wait?"

"Otitis Media","hi all, I have had a double ear infection recently after a really persistent cold (now gone). I had a week of antibiotics which seemed to clear up the redness and swelling in my ear canal and ear drum but over a week after I finished my antibiotics I still have really blocked feeling ears. I think it's starting to get slightly better but has anyone also had a tight feeling neck with ear problems as well. it started when the ear problems did, just down the right side but it doesn't seem to be going. I don't know if it's directly related to the ear infection/blockage or if its tension related (I've been pretty stressed since this all started). any help/input is appreciated!"
"Otitis Media","I was a competitive swimmer and when water got in my ear it would result in constant ear infections. I have been to a number of doctors and they have always told me I am just prone to them. I try to use plugs but they don't always stay in. Does anyone know if there is any alternative path I could take to protect my ears?"
"Otitis Media","I always go to the doctor once a year and get my ears irrigated with a water syringe due to ear wax. My ears will feel water logged, I go to the doctor they syringe out a big piece of wax, I get a little pop and my ear are cleared. This has been going on for years. About 6 months ago they had trouble getting some of the wax and told me next time to use Debroxm Sleep in it with a cotton ball overnight to soften the wax and then come in for the irrigation next time. This week I did that, the wax came out in one flush, they said everything is removed, however, my ears are still water logged. The doctor said it will go away in an hour, that was two days ago. I have tried alcohol/vinegar solution to dry it out. Do I need to contact a specialist?"
"Otitis Media","OK, Sorry I am late with up date. MRI showed nothing wrong in side my head. No tumor, no problems with any part of my ear parts or any thing that could effect them. RESULT; Hearing loss for no F*^king reason at all. Sorry.So I am going with the Cochlear Baha implant as a solution to my hearing loss. Please look it up and check it out. Can't explain it here.Note: Sudden Loss Of Hearing. It happens to 2-3% of the population of the USA! My wife has been a Registered nurse for 40 plus years. She has done it all. delivery, Bed side, Surgery, Case manager, to Director of nurses. She has never hear of such a thing as Sudden Hearing Loss!Good luck out there."
"Otitis Media","Hi there,I was wondering if anyone else is experiencing this issue - about 5 months ago I woke up one morning with severe hearing loss in my right ear - specifically, the hearing loss was really around lower frequency noise (all low frequency noises have a real noticeable vibration and distortion in my right ear).I did all the tests - Doctors did hearing tests and confirmed there was a HUGE jump down in decibels in my right ear - specifically around the low frequency side of things (which makes sense due to my low frequency distortion and way of hearing)...After then proceeding with all the tests to rule anything else out (I had a brain scan MRI, more hearing tests, ears were assessed etc etc... The doctors have no idea whats causing it, and have ruled it down to ""sudden sensonuerial hearing loss""..However, heres the catch 22 ... After seeing a specialist for Ear's she explained to me that SSNHL... should NOT be giving me fluctuations in my ear... It is a sudden loss in hearing of which, either gets better with time or doesent at all...This is why I want to explain what im feeling below right now and if anyone else has experienced this..Essentially, since it started, It has gotten much better but ive noticed a pattern which is incredibly strange.My right Ear has never been the same since I woke up with that almost deafness - but what it does do is fluctuate.. I have good days and bad days.. Sometimes I have a good couple of weeks!...What happens is this - I will wake up, and notice that my hearing in the right ear has dropped.. and everything sounds a but funny, if i run my finger across my Ear it sounds more blocked.. and then when a car drives by I notice the lower noise frequency vibrates and sounds odd in my ear.. ive also notice that all noise in the right ear soudns incredibly weird.. and distorted.. People voices sound almost robotic over the phone.. and its a real distorted uncomfotable feeling with this sensation of a low frequency tinnitus humming constantly (part of me thinks.. it is tinnitus, of which, the frequency it is humming is overshadowing my normal hearing and causing sound to be distorted and weird)...THEN! ... after 24-48 hours of this.. sometimes 3 days. I get a piercing loud high pitch in the ear (different tone of tinnitus?) BUT all of my hearing is back!! which is fantastic.. and I hear normally.. with exception of the tinnitus constantly there (this doesent bother me so much.. I am starting to live with it...)What I dont understand is its like my ear is constantly fluctuating from normal hearing... to low distorted frequency and odd vibrations with a drop in hearing.. to almost ""fixing"" itself back to normal but with a high pitch of tinnitus coming in...Its back and forth back and forth.. which kind of sucks, as every morning I wake up its like a gamble whether or not I hear that low vibration frequency echoing in my ear.. then I know straight away.. Yup... Ear is going to be crap the next couple of days...Does anyone else have this constant fluctuation in hearing and tones? - If so, what is it!? what have you done to alleviate it.The only thing that gives me happiness is the fact its not constant.. but it would be nice to find something to alleviate the fluctuation frequency.Additionally, the ONLY pattern (of which I am not 100% sure on this... ) Ive notived is it may be down to stress.. Ive noticed when I have something big on whether its a work function etc... without fail, my Ear will go blocked, low frequency vibrations and annoying.. then after the function within a day or two it clears up again... It could be just coincidence based on my ""ear cycle"" of it changing.. but it may be a pattern I need to assess more moving forward.Maybe its time to start mediating...Cheers!"
"Otitis Media","so this is going to sound a little weird and might be a little confusing so please try to bare with me lol. So basically whenever i hear sounds ( but not all the time) weather it is a car in the background, a bathroom fan, someone talking or someone talking on tv etc. i hear this strange faint whistling noise along side it. its mostly on my right ear but on the left as well. Im not sure if its tinnitis because i dont hear this whistling when its quiet. i do hear ringing when its quiet and i know THATS tinnitus but this whistling is a different type of noise."
"Otitis Media","So ive been having some pain when i swallow on the right side of my neck right under my jaw all the way up to the year. Ive had it for a few weeks. It has got a little better but at night the pain gets worse. I went to the ER a few weeks ago bc it was hurting so bad, they said i had no infection and sent me on my way, they tested for strep and other stuff which was negative. I woke up very early this morning with a weird twitch inside my ear. A thumping sound that i can feel and hear. Ive been having bodywide twitches since december especially in my right foot. Doctor doesnt know what it is. i suspected ALS could be possible cause but doctor wont refer me to a neurologist. Anyway, the ear twitch is completely new symptom. Somethings gotta be going on for me to have pain in my ear and my throat. has anybody ever had this issue???"
"Otitis Media","35 years old, had tympanostomy tubes placed 2 years or so ago after a lifetime of EUSTACHIAN TUBE DYSFUNCTION - didnt follow up as recommended and wound up with ""permanent"" holes in both ear drums which were patched using paper patch, right one has ultimately failed and now im petrified because i didnt know the failure had occurred until i recent purchased an oto-endoscopy camera (cheap one) to take a peek... now im petrified that i may have developed a cholesteatoma ... anyone with experience that can take a look and let me know what they think?"
"Otitis Media","Quick History:I went to a trip, I jumped on the sea, week later I had fluid in my ears and wouldnt fade away. Soon later I was experiencing scab and very dry ear and very stitchy. I removed a scab and a little blood came out. Now 2 months later I went to the ENT and he gave me Ciprofloxacin drops and Mupirocin Topical cream. Its the 5th day and its looking like this:is it working? I feel incredibly stichy and it doesnt smell or fluid comes out its just there like paste. No fever."
"Otitis Media","Some of you may have read my earlier posts detailing my stapedectomy op and recovery from October this year. Well yesterday I went back for a hearing test and to see the consultant who told me that the test shows a zero result, no hearing improvement and in fact the hearing has now deteriorated! I am disappointed to say the least, and when I asked the consultant if this had happened before he replied that I was the first to show this result.As always you come away from these appointments wishing that you had asked a dozen more questions and now I have been discharged and really dont know what to do next. Has this happened to anyone else? Also what is more disconcerting is that I am still left with a slight inbalance which is unsettling, the consultant assures me this will continue to improve over time."
"Otitis Media","Took 50mg 5htp and smoked marajuana then listened to music with headphones.Had multiple episodes of peircing tinnitus with uncomfortable intense head pressure for 3-4 days which is worse at night. I now have horrible sound intolerance that creates a very uncomfortable sensation in my head but doesnt necessarily cause pain in my ears aswell as a constant fluctuating sensation of head pressure 24/7 , and that something just feels 'wrong' in my head. This is made worse when i eat a large meal or even sip some coffee or alcohol, it has been 2 weeks since. Any advice?"
"Otitis Media","Hello has anyone ever had a Perforated eardrum surgically repaired. My surgeon has almost scaremongered me into not wanting to have it due to what he says are risks,in particular further hearing loss although Ive read that further ear infection causes hearing loss. I experience intermittent earache and giddiness he says it has nothing to do with it?which I find hard to believe Ive never had it before. Its causing me anxiety and hes not helped to me make a decision. Thanks anyone:)"
"Otitis Media","Odd one. Had necrotic otitis externa, full monty, into hospital, pumped full of super-strength antibiotics for five days, cured, all fine.Couple of years down the line, pains seeming to be in the ear, but only when I eat, particularly strong foods! Thus, the conclusion to which I'm jumping (probably wrongly) is that the original OE caused some internal damage at the junction of my jaw-bone.Opinions welcomed!Allen"
"Otitis Media","Went to ENT doctor today. Got hearing tested and examined. Possible answers!A. Sudden Hearing Loss. There is such a thing. 30% chance of recovery. Steroids injections behind ear and by pills. Up to three injections with a 7 day period between shots.B. A Tumor. Will need a MRI which has been ordered.I want to thank everyone for their responses and being so kind and thoughtful. I still want more info on this SHL . You just suddenly loose it? Wow! I will also update info on if there is a tumor, what's up.There was a response that told me about this exact situation of having this tumor. Check responses!Thanks againMacnSac"
"Otitis Media","Hi all,So long story short, I returned from a short trip on December 15th and the day prior I went snorkeling.Since my return, I got what I thought was a common cold. I went to the walk in clinic due to dizziness and was prescribed CIRC and amoxicillin, with no relief.I began physio thinking it was a case of vertigo, wrong again.I went to my family doctor and the walk in clinic who stated, ""dizziness happens.""Since this time, my ears began to ache and have experienced bad HEADACHES and an occasional sore throat. I went to emerge who advised I had fluid on my ears and to take an antihistamine for a week and see if it makes a difference. It has been over a week and I am still suffering.I have seen four doctors - three who advised there was nothing, one who advised there was fluid in my ear - eardrum.I am waiting to see a ENM Specialist but the wait is 6 months, and this is effecting my daily life a great amount. I feel like I am constantly exhausted.Has anyone experienced such a thing, what could it be? What can I do? Please help.Thank you!PS. It is now February 11th - almost two months!!!"
"Otitis Media","I have been suffering with earache and pain for 8 months now. It started at night in my right ear and I would wake up in the morning with earache. I put this down to me sleeping on my right side and blocking my ear for hours with my pillow. I went to my doctor who advised it was probably the start of a cold and to see how it goes. I never got a cold so went back and saw a nurse. The nurse said I had fluid in my ear and gave me a nasal spray. This spray did nothing and ended up going back to the doctors. I saw a different nurse this time, who told me there was no fluid in my ear, my ears looked healthy and to see how it goes.This was about 5 months with earache and it was getting worse and turning into a pain. It effected my sleep and started to ache during the day not just at night time. My ear also became blocked and effected the hearing in my right ear. I started sleeping on my left side to allow air to get to my right ear at night-time which did seem to help. When my earache got worse, I started to get the signs of tinnitus which drove me crazy when trying to get to sleep. I went back to the doctors who referred me to ENT clinic at the hospital. The doctor at the hospital checked my ears and put a camera up my nose and came to the same conclusion as the other doctor. My ears were perfect and there was nothing in my sinuses effecting my ears. He put me forward for an MRI scan.8 months down the line with my MRI scheduled for next month, my left ear has started to lightly ache and fear that this may get worse too. I fear that the MRI scan will not show anything and have no idea what steps to take. I thought about going back to my doctors but not sure what else they can do. The doctors I have seen tell me to change my job to something that doesnt require wearing a headset but I dont think this is a solution although it will probably help. Also thought about going to see a specialist but this could be costly.A few things that might help to know:Recently been on holiday and my ear pain got worse when landing.I work in a call centre and have done for 22 months and wear a headset for the best part of the day. Before this, I worked in a different call centre wearing a headset for 2 years.From the age of 10 I have had their weird thing where when I swallow it like makes my ears crackle/pop. I must hold my nose and sniff up to like counteract it which makes my ears feel full. The fullness then wears off within seconds until I swallow again and the same thing happens repeatedly.I have never had any previous problems with my ears.I have never had excessive earwax or had to have earwax removed.My earache does not seem to be affected by noise in general.Earache worsens when obstructed by headset, pillow etc and noticed more ache when wind blows into my ear.I have had blood tests for vitamin D deficiency, diabetes and thyroid which all came back negative.No liquids, discharge or blood coming from my earsFrom the age of 14 to 24, I have suffered with tonsillitis once, twice and sometimes three times a year. On two occasions, it turned out to be a severe form of tonsillitis called Quincy."

"Otitis Media","Hi, so long story short I went swimming (about a year and half ago) and I got water stuck in my ear for about 5 days. It eventually just disappeared.Not too long after that I started to feel this weird head feeling that I could not explain, and it's been constant ever since. The best I can describe it would be slightly unbalanced/dizzy. Not spinning. Some days worse than others.Doctors have no idea and just keep checking my blood which is normal every time then send me on my way. Also doctor won't refer me to ENT because I have no other ear symptoms.Any ideas at all of what this could be and what I should do?"
"Otitis Media","I just had some very crunchy snacks and my ears kept popping every time I chewed. I have bruxism and my jaw occasionally pops and clicks. Could this be the reason? Or does it sound more like an ear infection? I have been feeling a bit under the weather the last week, I have been quite dizzy and nauseas and have had a mild fever."
"Otitis Media","Hi there! Any advice or even just opinions would be hugely appreciated! Thank you!Issue DescriptionI have had an ear infection for about three days now, and ended up booking a private doctor video-call appointment as I really wanted antibiotics (my immune system is terrible and exams are incoming). I have experienced some fever an hour after the ear pain begun suddenly and with force three days ago at night. Somewhat warm since but not a full fledged fever. Experienced jaw joint pain for a couple weeks before (unusual for me).The doctor could not see into my ear as it was too swollen. I was prescribed this spray as well as some oral antibiotics. The instructions of the spray say it may cause hearing loss and should not be used with a burst eardrum.Just as I used the spray I've gone deaf in my left ear. I used to be able to pull my ear lobe down to hear perfectly before; not anymore. I've tried to clean it out with an ear bud. No successI have no idea if I have a burst eardrum. I have tried to use ear cotton buds to poke about and try to clean it out a few times before the doc appointment. When reaching in deep I would feel serious pain but not where the eardrum should be; more around it (possibly because of the inflammation).I don't think I'm experiencing any vertigo, and I don't think I've had any discharge. I also don't think I've felt any liquid trickle past my eardrum further into my ear. I do have serious tinnitus in the now deaf ear but I probably had that from before; the silence might just be overemphasising the tinnitus.**ACTUAL QUESTIONWhat is the possibility that a small ear perforation might cause permanent hearing loss from using 'Otomize' once?andIs it really that easy to perforate an ear drum with a cotton bud while being quite cautious? Can a cotton bud cause only a small perforation without causing extreme pain?Thank you so much!"
"Otitis Media","3 days ago i went to the doctor in Lombok (i'm out traveling) To look up my earproblem. i have been diving for a couple of days. I had pain when pressing on my ear, some itching. The doctor looked in my ear and then pulled out something that looked like white earwax. He told me my ears was full of this white stuff. He then cleard my ear using a syringe looking thing that filled my ear with some water if some kind. After that he filled my ear with eardrops and i laid there for some time. Then he gave me painkillers and said that i was to take them if i felt pain. Now my question is it has been 3 days and i feels a little better but not much. Why didnt he give me eardrops? He told me my eardrum looked fine. Should i go buy some eardrops or just let it heal by itself?Thank you"
"Otitis Media","I think I have an ear infection, my ear is hurting feels like its in the inner ear. My mood is plummiting, my balance is off and i'm waking up in a cold sweat. My sleep is really bad and I think i've started sleepwalking.Anyone else had this?"

"Otitis Media","I feel a decent amount of pressure in my right eardrum when I yawn. I took a picture and would like to know if what I see is fluid and air Bubbles at the the bottom of the eardrum.

"Otitis Media","My friend brought in an ear endoscope you use with your phone so I was checking out my ears. In my left ear I saw this small bump (along with some wax...). After some Internet research I came across articles on Cholesteatomas. Is this what this is? Should I see a physician? I've had some mild ear/jaw pain for a few months now but associated it with TMJ issues."
"Otitis Media","I've been having hearing issues for a while now (at least 6 months or more) - and the last couple of weeks the tinnitus was getting worse - I got myself some otex (I thought it was due to earwax) - which did absolutely nothing. Visited the doctors - no wax in my ears at all - and have been referred to ENT. In the mean time I wanted to see what I was up against - and got a very thorough check at Specsavers - to find out I have normal hearing for my age in my left ear - and really bad hearing in my right ear - to the point where the audiologist said she would have told me to see GP for referral to ENT! I find it really difficult when in social settings to actually understand conversations - as it turns out my left ear is having to compensate for my right - as well as having trouble pinpointing sound in general. Just wondering if anyone can give me any tips - I do have an appointment for ENT - but not for 6 weeks - and I have 2 quite important social occasions coming up before then - and don't want to appear rude when I can't hold a conversation in a noisy room!??Thanks!"
"Otitis Media","Hello,I've been having this constant issue (probably for the past 2 years) where every time I stand up after sitting for a long period, my ears start to ring and I start to feel very lightheaded and feel like I'm about to fall over. This usually lasts for 3-5 seconds. Today though, it was much worse. I had all the same symptoms, but then when I was holding onto something to not fall over, my arms began to wobble uncontrollably. Why am I having these problems, and why does it seem like it's getting worse? I try to drink plenty of water, and stand up when I can, but I do a lot of driving so I can't stand up often.Thanks,Jack"

I put on my headphones again I know I only listen some noises as if you press all the piano keys at the same time.I just spoke with my doctor is says that I shouldn't be worried because it may pass around 4-5 weeks to know if the hearing improve.Has anyone had this kind of hearing change over the first week?"

"Otitis Media","please help!! my dad has hearing loss in both ears, he has hearing aids but wont wear them, he says they don't work. he's had this for a long time and i know this is not the first hearing aid either. does anyone know why someone would refuse to wear their hearing aids? r they uncomfortable? because nobody can stand to be in the same room he's in. my mom and nephew both stay in their rooms ALL THE TIME. i hate to say this, but my dad is extremely lazy, selfish and apparently doesn't care that he's making everybody miserable. my parents' dog is now deaf because he has the tv on 24/7 blasting so loud that i have to wear earplugs. im going thru a financially difficult time right now so im staying with my parents temporarily. im so worried about my 2 cats too, i can wear earplugs but they can't. why would somebody choose to alienate everybody around him? r hearing aids that bad? please help me understand before i snap"
"Otitis Media","Hey everybody,I've had on and off issues with my ears for years but not to the extent that's been happening lately. lately I've been having constant dulling of noise in my right ear. The best way I can describe it is that my right ear lost the ability to notice high pitched noises and doesn't react in a normal fashion. I can't make out any words in any area that has background noise unless I'm looking at somebody's lips, and even then its tough. If I wear headphones and take one of the buds out of my right ear the sound doesn't seem like it changes at all, I don't have insurance right now but I'm starting to talk myself into a diagnoisis of sensineural hearing loss which I know is untreatable. Does anybody have any words of wisdom or a similar issue? thanks."
"Otitis Media","For about a week now I have been experiencing a vibrating sensation in my left ear. It started off quite slowly when I was trying to fall asleep, and it was only mildly annoying then, but now it is constantly present and the vibrations happen several times per second. They are really making me lose sleep and driving me mad. I called my doctor but I couldn't get an appointment until Friday due to Christmas. I could get one of his assistants to clear my ear of earwax yesterday, but that didn't help.Can someone please help me? It doesn't hurt, but it is extremely annoying and I want it to stop before Christmas. I don't have any other clear problems. Except maybe that I seem to be thirstier than usual. It is just the constant vibrations in my ear. It is not just a sound, I can actually feel the vibrations.I have been using a nose spray since Thursday, since that was recommended by the doctor's assistant. Other than that I don't use any medications.Age: 21Sex: MaleHeight: 1,7 metersWeight: 58 Kilograms"
"Otitis Media","Please has anyone experienced this before - I have a whooshing sound in my right ear when I bend down, turn my head in certain positions, it last for a about 30 seconds. It also happens if I wake up in the night. I went to see my doctor and she carried out different tests all clear, she listened to my neck on both sides and said that was clear, I have been referred to a ENT but there is a long waiting list.

"Otitis Media","I've been having a recurring issue for the past month or two with my right ear ringing strangely around loud voices. I work at a kindergarten so I'm exposed to children shouting every day and it's not really possible to avoid. I've had some level of tinnitus for most of my life, but this is different than the normal ringing. It sounds more like an echo chamber than a ringing. It never bothers me outside of the school, but most people aren't as loud as a classroom full of children. I may go to a doctor when I can, but I'm not in an English speaking country and it's often difficult to communicate issues unless I tell them the name of some specific problems it could be. Thank you."
"Otitis Media","Hello i perforated my eardrum in late August. potentially from scuba diving. I was referred to the ent department. where I was given antibiotics . 6 weeks later the infection was still there. I been back and ive done 2 weeks of antibiotics and now on steroid drops. I am concerned about my ear as it's been ringing, so i bought a ear camera (safe to use) and i was shocked to find this image.What can I do to make this better? i dont see the ent doctor for another 8 weeks"
"Otitis Media","I've had an ear infection for 4.5 months, unresponsive to 9 courses of antibiotics and topical treatments.I had a CT scan which showed the middle ear to be full of fluid which is likely infectious fluid, considering what is still coming out (literally dripping out of my ear). Surgeon cleaned my ear for the 6th time, using suction and tried to examine for presence of Cholesteatoma but he was unable to see well enough. He has ordered a specialist Mastiod MRI scan to look for Cholesteatoma and also determine how far the infection has gone into the bone and tissue.He highly suspects the scan will confirm Cholesteatoma. He said he's 90% sure I will need a modified radical Mastiodsectomy. I have my scan in 2 weeks and see the surgeon again around Christmas time.Has anyone here ever had that procedure?"
"Otitis Media","Hello all!This is my first time posting on here, let me know if I am missing anything! I am a 21yo female in California, and I have been having this very strange and quite annoying fluttering in my right ear. I should probably preface this with some recent health history: a few weeks ago I had a small bit of a sore throat and post nasal drip. It may be the aftermath of my strep throat, which I took a 5-day antibiotic run for it- that happened about a month ago (right before the sore throat). It went away successfully, but like I said: I had lingering uncomfortability and some mucus stuff going kn. Also, in August, I had mono which also put my throat and lymph nodes through the ringer in general!The fluttering/throbbing does not hurt. My hearing is beyond fine, I do not feel any pressure. It is just a very weird and quite annoying fluttery feeling. It has gotten a lot more frequent in the last week (it's been going on for 2 weeks now), almost every few seconds now!! When I called the Kaiser advice nurse line when it had been going on for just a few days, she recommended a hot compress and a decongestant. I tried a hot water bottle and my ear did not flutter when it was applied, but not even a minute after the heat was gone would it start again  what's up with that?Then, about 6 days ago, I noticed my right lymph node was swollen and hard  not painful, and no sore throat. The swelling hasn't gone down yet and continues to stay firm if I push down on it.One last strange thing about this all is I have light neck pain- but only on the back right?I may just be imagining this as well, but I may have very slight pain in my lymph nodes under the armpits as well...?"
"Otitis Media","around 3 months ago, i spent a few weeks with what appears to be labrynthitis, and after days of it being severe, it eased off.For just over a week i have been having spells of giddiness and head/neck tension like before, sometimes but not always caused by movement.i have read (on here) that you can get flare ups of symptoms months after it has passed, but i wondered if anyone else has experience with it?"
"Otitis Media","I have been using using Otex and Otex Express. First application of Otex immediately blocked my ear. I continue to use it because I read that this is part of the Otex treatment - it expands the wax, and blocks the ear. However, the video for Otex Express shows the product entering the ear and breaking the wax into small pieces and leaving through the ear canal. This has not been my experience. My ears are still blocked and when food repeats the ear will pop.I have switched to olive oil.Has anybody else on the site had this or a similar experience?"
"Otitis Media","Hello,I have bad itching in right ear for almost one year. It especially bad after shower. At some point I was scratching it probably too intensive and got a fullness feeling right after.One week ago I had something very strange. I had tinnitus the night before and woke up in the morning with my right ear blocked. I very rarely have tinnitus, I probably had it only few times for the whole life. So with my right ear I was able to hear very poorly, maybe 20-50%. So far I had two ENT doctors appointments. The first one said it may be Meniere's. The ear blockage was resolved afternoon. I also had a pressure feeling that day.I also had bad reflux before that Im currently trying to manage but have dry cough sometimes all day.Now, one week after the episode I sometimes have light right ear pressure feeling and minor right ear pain that is worse after coughing.I also have minor tinnitus all the time but its only noticeable in the silence. It doesn't bother me much.I started taking Claritin and so far I dont have itching anymore but Im worry about Meniere's and pain.Would you please tell me what can it be?Thanks."
"Otitis Media","I have a history of swimmers ear, but this was over 20 years ago. Recently, I noticed that sleeping on my left side, where the swimmers ear was, I awoke with similar pain. I used Otex ear drops and since then, the ear has been blocked with only muffled hearing in that ear. Also my nasal passages block and I use a nasal spray. I have been told that Otex will expand the ear wax as it softens, which may account for the blockage. I have used over the counter olive oil, and then discovered Otex Express which I have been using since. I have ordered an irrigation kit, but have been advised that the ear wax has to be treated for at least seven days.I am wondering if anyone on the site has had experience of Otex. NHS will not treat, so the problem with the ear has not been professionally diagnosed. My surgery don't want to know, and encouraged me to continue to self diagnose and self treat.Any feedback would be very helpful."
"Otitis Media","About a year ago I was at a basketball arena and out of nowhere the room started spinning on me. I had a vertigo episode that caused me to throw up, drenched head to toe in sweat, and I was pale as a ghost. The next day I woke up with ear crackling that has not gone away since. I have gone through almost every ENT test to determine what they believe it is. I keep getting told that they are stumped. All hearing tests came back normal.Now I havent been having dizzy spells but have crackling in my ears when I swallow, neck/jaw pain, pressure in my sinuses/eyes, post nasal drip, bags under my eyes.Things I have tried with no help: mouthguard for TMJ, Upper cervical chiro, regular chiropractor, sinus rinses for 3 months. I have also been getting allergy shots and am almost to the maintenance stage and havent noticed a difference.I have been put on an anti-anxiety med (currently at one week) and am awaiting a test result for Lyme. Does anyone have any idea what I could be dealing with?Working on scheduling a visit to the Mayo Clinic in Dec/Jan"
"Otitis Media","I fell onto a toy 3 weeks ago and perforated my eardrum. It started to bleed so I went to the ER and was given neomycin/Polymyxin B otic suspension drops. I used them one time (3 drops) and then read they shouldn't be used with a perforation so I stopped. A day later my ears started ringing, this also coincided with the day the blood dried. Is it normal to have high-pitched ringing from a perforation or from a scab/dried blood on the eardrum? Or should I be worried that the eardrops have caused damage to my inner ear? I saw an ENT who said not to worry about the drops but it is so hard not to after the terrifying things I've read. He confirmed dried blood on my eardrum. Hearing test was good. If ringing is from the perforation or the scab, how long should it take to improve? Ringing is no matter after 3 weeks. Also, since my ear was bleeding when I used the drops, is there risk of toxicity from the neomycin entering my bloodstream? Thanks!"
"Otitis Media","Hi all, I feel slightly ridiculous mentioning this but it's beginning to bother me. Just to set the scene, I am a 41yo man who is in reasonable health. I don't smoke and I only drink socially. I do stammer although I'm not sure that's relevant haha.So, I wanted to see what people thought I'd able something that's always been the case but I seem to be more aware of it lately. From a hearing perspective I have no actual hearing issues, per se, although I've not had a hearing test in a while I have no issues with regards to being able to hear noises, I can hear a pin drop in fact so I have no reason to suspect my hearing is a problem as such.What I am becoming increasingly frustrated with is my ability to focus on noises. For instance, I could be stood in Sainsburys with my wife, she could be stood 3 feet away from me and talking to me and I can barely make out whats she's saying. I can hear people's conversations who are 10 feet away and further, I can hear the tills beeping, things crashing around etc but yet I can't focus on what's shes saying.Recently we went out for a meal with some friends and I could hear a couple arguing on a table several tables away and noone else picked up on it except me and they all joked I must have bionic hearing to have noticed. But in reality I was struggling to keep focused on the conversation at our table and instead could hear everything else.We then went to a gin bar locally and it turned out they had a karaoke night on and I spent most of the 2 hours we were in there sitting there just staring around because I couldn't focus on the group conversation. It got to the point that the music and all the other noises going on made me want to put my hands over my ears and just walk out.I've encountered this a few times when out shopping in a busy shop if it's loud I get all hot and sweaty and have the urge to leave really badly.I've been called socially awkward all my life but these things have always been there, even when I was in my late teens going clubbing I would generally just sit there and zone out of what my friends were doing.My GP is ridiculously difficult to get to see, like it can be 3 weeks before you can get an appointment so I thought I'd see what people think"
"Otitis Media","This is really a follow on from my earlier posts, as I just wanted to give an update on my recovery since having a stapedectomy in my right ear at the LGI on 12th October.As said, it was my second operation as I had previously had a stapedectomy in my right ear but that was over twenty years ago.Day of Operation:All went according to plan, no cancellations fortunately, all staff supportive and very pleasant . Operation performed under general anesthetic ( I was offered the option of local but decided against it), from start to recovery lasted about 1 hour 30 mins. Came round feeling quite pleased with myself, having no after effects from the anesthetic and seemingly my balance was ok too. I was back home by 7pm having had the op at 2pm.Day 1 Post Op:With hind site I think I attempted too much, including a short drive, plus a small shop at the supermarket! But I still continued to feel ok.Day 2:Still not too bad, although lots of noises in my ear, and what I self diagnosed as pulsatile tinnitus, very annoying and a bit worrying. I had been told to leave all packing in my ear including that in the ear canal so really could not asses if my hearing had improved. Sleeping through the day and not too well at night as I didnt want to lay on mybad` ear.Day 3:Did nothing much all day, beginning to get quite dizzy and still had the tinnitus. Not eating a great deal either, bought lucozade to sip on.Day 4:Sorry to say but this was my worst day ever, with extreme motion sickness. I had to drag myself to the doctor to be examined and he prescribed Prochlorperazine tablets which helped. Still eating very littleDay 5:Continued taking the tablets and feeling terrible. Packing in my ear is annoying me so I really hope I get an appointment soon to remove it.Day 6 (today):I can now, at last begin to feel some improvement. I am trying with out the sickness tablets so I can asses my progress but I am still taking it steady, Dizziness is still there and some nausea but nothing like as bad as it was on Day 4! The tinnitus has gone too.Hope this isnt too much information but it really helped me to read what others are going through so hope you feel the same. I still feel it will be well worth the operation once I have made a full recovery"
"Otitis Media","i have had a small cyst behind my war for a year or so sometimes it hurts, but two days ago the cyst turned black and it hurts. i dont know if i bumped it or what happened"
"Otitis Media","I have had this problem with my ears for about 8-9 years now (I'm 16) - I never thought much of it and it never bothered me that much when I was younger but it's starting to become more of a problem now.Basically, I feel like I constantly have pressure in my ears. If I take a very deep breath abruptly through my nose, I can do what feels like 'sucking' the 'pressure' (?) deeper into my inner ear, and if I yawn or hold my nose and blow, I can do the opposite. I have become pretty good at controlling this, however when I yawn without meaning to it can be quite annoying - as it is not only uncomfortable, but it also changes the volume of everything I hear. 'sucked in' = quiet, muffled noise... 'pushed out' = unusually loud noise. I find it more comfortable to keep this pressure 'sucked in' so this is what I do the majority of the time.The trouble is, unlike other people who can pop their ears after flights etc. to equalise the pressure, I don't seem to be able to do this. I hold my nose and blow as hard as I can, but this 'pressure' reaches a point where it is pushed out (away from the inside of my head) and will physically not go any further. I'm not sure if it is literally not possible for me to push any harder or whether it is the fear of damaging my ear drum or something inside my ear that is stopping me from pushing it. When I push out the pressure, I hear clicks and strange sounds that sound like they are underwater. As I mentioned, this didn't bother me much when I was younger, but now I have realised that it is making me quite an introverted person - it amplifies the sound of my voice and makes it sound really low (when I listen to recordings it's not as low) and muffles the sound of other people talking so I often don't hear what other people are saying to me and have to ask them to repeat multiple times. The combination of not liking the amplified sound of my own voice and the fact that I have muffled hearing of external sounds makes me not want to talk to people very much and so I have become really shy and I will avoid saying a lot when people ask me questions.I have visited a specialist about this, however he simply suggested that it was due to the structure of my skull and eustachian tubes not being completely right and this causing an imbalance of pressure which I cannot correct, but he told me that I would probably grow out of it, and prescribed some nasal drops to relieve the discomfort. I have had this problem for nearing 10 years now, so I don't feel like I am going to grow out of it, and the nasal drops didn't help. One thing he did tell me from a test he ran was that my ear drums are apparently quite tight and more 'sucked in' than they should be. So is this the eardrum that I can feel moving every time I try to adjust the pressure?I don't know what to do, my parents spent 拢300 on a specialist appointment, just to be prescribed some nose drops and the problem is really starting to affect me, both in my social life and studies, since the muffled sound makes it so hard to concentrate on what teachers are saying.If anyone knows anything (i.e. what this problem could be, is it common, are there any treatments) then please help; I am willing to do anything.Thanks in advance"
"Otitis Media","Hey everyone, so I posted here before about the vertigo I experienced, but I'm still left with some symptoms. Last year I had vertigo around spring time after I woke up for a few seconds. I vomited and had diarrhea afterwards, but felt fine the next day. This time, I had vertigo in the beginning of May for around 5 seconds after waking up, but my ear felt plugged afterwards. I felt unbalanced after my vertigo attack and still feel unbalanced today. Although my unbalanced feelings have gotten better, my right eustachian tube is still hard to open/pop. I feel like I can always pop my left ear, but it is harder to get that relief in my right ear. It has been six months and I still don't feel 100% because everytime I walk I feel slightly unbalanced and sometimes like my foot sinks into the floor or the floor moves for a split second (gets worse throughout the day). My right ear is also really annoying me because it's not like how it used to be - no problems with popping it. I am so tired of feeling like this and it's really hard to keep up with my school work (I'm 20 years old and in university) when I always feel off. I noticed I had the slightest problem with popping my right ear before this all happened - don't know if that relates. I was on vacation in Montreal and a week after I got back home I woke up with a few seconds of vertigo and 6 months of torture. Don't know why it happened and why I still have these residual symptoms.Been to my family doctor who referred me to a ENTdoctor and basically told me I have bppv without doing any tests. She stuck an endoscope up my nose and said everything looked fine and I had a hearing test with an audiologist who said my hearing was within normal ranges, although my left ear was slightly better at hearing. I had the ENT appointment in July and recently I went to my schools doctor for my right ear eustachian tube problems and feeling weird/unbalanced when I walk and basically told me I don't have bppv (without doing tests) and said I have ETD. She looked up my nose and said they looked like I was affected by allergies which is closing my eustachian tube and to just use nasal sprays (which my family doctor already prescribed for me), steam and antihistamines. She told me to only come back if I get tinnitus, which I only notice when I'm really tired or stressed and can only hear when I go to bed. I told her that and she said ""so, no, you don't have tinnitus.""Any success stories, advice, medication, exercises to make this go away will be EXTREMELY appreciated.Thank you!!!"

"Otitis Media","Hello everyone I am 18 years old i have destroyed my ears honestly i feel stupid for causing my self these problems. It all started when i felt a bit of ear wax when i put my finger in my ears.. so i went and got a cotton bud and used it and being stupid i pushed it really deep causing me to push my earwax deep to my eardrum. my ear felt really stuffed and was effecting my hearing so next morning i went to the GP and they said i had a lot of ear wax and prescribed me oil drops to remove the ear wax. I was told it would take 2 weeks and i really didnt want to wait so i went to a private clinic with a lot of good reviews and got a procedure which sucks out my ear wax using a suction tool. after that procedure a day later i got an ear infection in both ears which caused my ETD and about a month and a half later i got my tinnitus. i went to the GP again and again and they kept telling me to give it time and relax and it should go away but its been 2 months since then and nothing has changed"

"Otitis Media","Greetings,For one and a half year, I have had problems that pertain to my ear. Specifically, I have had:pain in my left ear,painful eyestinnitus (hearing my own pulse on left ear, usually when it was very quiet, noticed it at night),bouts of dizziness,IMMENSE fatigue (sleeping for 12 hours and feeling very tired, unable to wake up easily/function with 8 hours of sleep or less).Also, the entry to my ear canal (and I presume the entire canal) is swollen, as in a cotton swab will fit through the entry to my right ear canal, but not through my left ear unless I push it.I have visited at least 5 different ENTs in that time period,with some attributing the above to ear infections, labyrinthitis, psoriasis and whatnot. I've had an MRI and a CT scan in that time period as well as blood tests and all results were clean, with the exception of a slight deviation in my nasal septum, on the same side with the problematic ear. However, the deviation was considered minor by all doctors,as in couldn't be responsible for my symptoms.I have been on multiple courses of antibiotics with little to no effect.Three months ago, after extensive online research, I concluded that the cause of my problems was a Tempomandibular Joint Dysfunction, as a result of bruxism. I've had bruxism since before 2015, but I hadn't used the soft biteplate provided by my dentist.I started using it every night without exception as soon as I made the aforementioned realisation.After talking with my dentist, he concluded that this is indeed the cause of the problems I've faced after conducting an examination, and I insisted on getting an oral splint that would allow no movement of my lower jaw during nighttime.Since then (a week ago), I have noticed a reduction in the feeling of fatigue ,eye strain,however my ear canal remains swollen, as in my pinky will fit into my right ear but hardly into my left one. Also, the ear canal remains painful to the touch, but I have no pain when applying pressure on my tragus or pulling down on my earlobe. To help mediate the swelling, I am using over the counter drops for outer ear infections with little to no effect, except mitigating the pain slightly because they contain cortisone.Is it possible that the swelling is caused by my TMJ dysfunction and will subside with time?Do I have an outer ear infection? If so, why do the drops not work?Should I visit an ENT?Info about me:I am 22 years old, I weigh 78 kg and I am 180cm tall.I am a university student so being ""down"" takes a big toll on my work and my psychology in general.Thanks in advance."
"Otitis Media","Hi. I already knew that my hearing was kind of bad as it's suspected that I have meniere's disease, but that has never been fully verified by a doctor. I do have most if not all of the symptoms and my father also has it. In my intro to psychology class we were going over hearing/the ears and the professor had some sounds for us to hear. I heard 10,000hz, and 14,000hz fine but when he got to 17,000hz I heard nothing. I ended up googling some more tones and its around 16,000hz that I cant really hear anything. I'm only 19 years old but I'm not sure what range is normal for my age or gender if that is a factor (female).Hi.

"Otitis Media","Persistent middle ear infection, drained 3 times via suction procedure but still fills up with puss again within 15 minutes.Also a perforated eardrum, ENT said the infection is behind the perforation.I've had 5 different antibiotics, 3 targeted antibiotics after infection swab results. None have worked and it is not getting better at all. Still a lot of puss and swelling. The bug is Psudomonas but apparently a very resistant strain, likely got whilst I was in Kenya.Next possible antibiotics are IV but ENT seem to defer the IV treatment... it was considered by my GP to be needed 12 days ago.Is there a reason why IV treatment would be deferred?"
"Otitis Media","Hi everyone, I just wanted to share my experience in hope that it might give someone else ease in worrying about their problems. For the past 4 years I have suffered with chronic ear/sinus problems. Ears - ringing in the left side, whooshing (especially at night) rumbling, slight pain shooting pains, certain sounds such as dishes clattering making it rumble, dizziness. Sinus problems - constant stuffiness/ bleeding, pressure behind my nose, head, headaches. The whole experience has been extremely stressful and worrying, finally I was referred to a private hospital (through the NHS) as it was the quickest they could get me in, I had a CT scan of my sinuses, found I had a prominent deviation on one side which was causing the majority of the sinus problems - simple mechanical fix with an op Im awaiting on, but still, I unsure about the ear. Still feeling worried about the ear problems and now my mind was constantly focused on this, they were much worse. Constant symptoms in my left ear that just did not feel normal! I was referred back to the same specialist who said he wanted to do an MRI scan of my ear / brain and was looking to rule out a non malignant tumour called a glumose tumour - a swelling behind the inner ear which CAN cause similar symptoms to the above mentioned. I was absolutely convinced I had this before the specialist mentioned it to me, so when he told me that was what they were looking for, it confirmed my own diagnosis. Now to move on, I have suffered with chronic health anxiety for the last 10 years, Im a 27 year old female otherwise fit and healthy, I drive my self crazy constantly over thinking my health and always worrying theres something wrong, small symptoms I overthink and dwell on I constantly search the Internet looking for reassurance and I am well aware that a lot of the problems I have are all in my head. Still, is doesnt stop the real physical symptoms which I experience. The viscious circle of feeling an unusual symptom and then how it can become completely exaggerated by your own mind has been a long long battle in itself and its something Ive researched a lot, psychosomatic symptoms have a lot to answer for! Today I had this scan in tears and worry for absolutely nothing and it was ALL CLEAR, i am over the moon but still a little in shock as it doesnt mean my symptoms have disappeared at all, it just means Im extremely stressed, anxious and that is normal for my body. It doesnt mean the ear problems arent really there, it means its normal for me but my body and mind exaggerate the issues, and also the constant over worrying can create further problems as things start not working as the should do within ones body. Anyone suffering anxiety similar to my experiences please have hope in the fact that your symptoms could all be related to this. Anyone who doesnt,Please Stay open minded as it took me a very long time to be open to the fact that I could feel physical horrible symptoms from anxiety, but its so true, the road is long and the battle is a long one which Im still working through myself. Stay strong and live for the moment and enjoy it, else you end up spending so so much time and negative energy on it all. Youre still here now  - much love guys xP.s - the above experience Ive shared is intended only to help others, Ive not at any point intended to offend or patronise so sincere apologies if its come across that way. I understand a lot of people have problems which are non anxiety related, but I thought If I can help anyone along the way then great -"
"Otitis Media","Tinnitus is a standout amongst the most irritating conditions where the patient hears clamor in their ears which happens to be just in their imagination. It has gradually turned into a typical infection influencing two out of 10 individuals. In the event that you are one of the victims of tinnitus, at this point there is an incredible possibility that you have officially burned through a large sum of money on the treatment. It happens to be the aging effect on people but these days many cases are reported by the people of young age too and its highly alarming!!Tonaki Tinnitus Protocol is the answer to all of your queries regarding tinnitus and it guarantees to kill this illness with promising cure."
"Otitis Media","This is my last hope of finding a solution. I've tried everything.My right ear has done this thing on and off ever since I can remember. My doctor thought it was due to swollen tonsils but the meds he gave me didn't help. The closest I can come up with is a patulous Eustachian tube, but again my doctor didn't see anything wrong with my ear. He said it looks totally normal.I've seen him twice, but don't want to go again as he obviously didn't find a solution. And I'm broke...But for about two months now (the longest this has ever happened) every single day, usually most of the day starting right when I wake up or soon after, it stars. Sometimes with ringing, sometimes it's just my heartbeat or a thumping. But most of the time it sounds like breathing. I know this sounds crazy but it literally sounds (and actually feels) like my ear has become a second nose.It only happens when my mouth is closed and I'm breathing out my nose. If I'm breathing completely out of my mouth, or plugging my ear, I can't hear it. It always feels stuffy even though it's not. I haven't had a cold in I don't know how long. I clean my ears enough that it wouldn't be built up earwax, but not so much that stuff can get in there. Lying down on that side doesn't help, putting my head between my legs doesn't help. Drinking more water hasn't helped. I've tried multiple antihistamines and the doxycycline my doctor had me try.I can't stand it anymore. It is literally driving me to insanity. I'm already mentally ill and this does not help my state of mind. It LITERALLY makes me have panic attacks and takes away from a quality life. I don't know how to explain this anymore.Someone please help me."
"Otitis Media","Hi everyone,Ive posted this in the rhinitis group but I think I might get help from here too.So I have both eczema (my whole life) and allergic rhinitis (for around 8 yrs) and nasal polyps and slightly deviated septum.Its quite bothersome to have all these issues (runny nose , facial pain , tears, thick mucus at the back of the throat..etc)But there is another symptom that has been the worst.I have this constant cycle of feeling like my ears are full of fluid , and then it will drain and feel dry , and then the feeling of fluid moving would come back..etc until it made me go mad.I keep telling my doctor about this issue and he did a test (I forgot its name) that showed some missing reflexes in my right ear . He then ordered a hearing test that showed my hearing is slightly lower (within normal) in my right ear.So he dismissed the whole thing.I saw him today and raised the same issue because its been bothering me more lately . He checked my ears and said theyre VERY dry and that I scraped all the wax of off them ! I told him I see water come out of my ear , he said sarcastically that my ears are dry as a dessert! And then he proceeded to tell my how Im imaging things that arent there and that I have no problem with my ears and I should stop complaining!!!Im really mad and feel lost ! Because I see the fluid in the tissue and I even showed my mom that was with me at the appointment.Anyway , I just needed to rant because I really feel crazy"

"Otitis Media","Ever since I took my first trip on a plane and learned how popped my ears it has been a constant thing I do. Some days I may not do it but most days I find myself popping and popping and popping until I feel actual anger towards myself for doing so. I have not been diagnosed with OCD or anything like it but Im starting to think I have it. The feeling of uneven pressure that never balances out from right to left ear invaded my day. I can pop them by breathing in or out of my nose and opening my mouth but am constantly teased by the fact that they pop everytime I swallow whether its while eating or just swallowing saliva. Ive read about childhood ear infections and the tubes in your ears being affected by them. I even found a forum of people with the same condition but not much on how to treat it or if its even been studied/named. I hope someone can help or at least guide me in the direction of help, whether its physical or psychological. Thank you"

It happens when I move my head or yawn. I have been very dizzy everyday for months. I have been to a neurologist and I had an mri which showed clear. I have a hair salon which has been open for over a year which is when a lot of my symptoms began. I had an eeg about 4 years ago which showed temporal lobe epilepsy and I never had a grand male seizure, however I have had the dejavu simple seizures since I was a kid.. the neurologist said that and this vertigo and newly happening migraines are all related. Which last September I started getting very regular and severe blinding migraines, and at that point my health has really declined. Im not sure what this constant dizziness is, nor the weird noise is in my ear. Im having a hard time believing its related. Im having a hard time getting through my life like this.

"Otitis Media","Hi! I'm 17 and this is my third ear infection this year. Last year I had two. And the year before I had one left untreated so bad it left me without much hearing in one of my ears for weeks. Obviously ear infections are common in younger kids, but I rarely ever hear of anyone else my age getting them. Especially not as much as I do. Why do I get them, and why are they always so bad? They always occur in my left ear and are always so bad that I lose hearing for quite a while. Hi! I'm 17 and this is my third ear infection this year. Last year I had two.

"Otitis Media","HiPlease can someone help me to find out what could be wrong with me as I feel I keep getting misdiagnosed.I was diagnosed supposedly with TMJ about 8 years ago and ive been taking various antidepressants as I was told that would help with the nerve damage in my face, it's never really helped though, I've also been taking ibuprofen, codeine and other painkillers over the years, also I've had many courses of antibiotics.For along time I've also suffered with a blocked nose and I was only recently diagnosed with a deviated septum.I had a motorbike accident about 15 years ago and it was not long after this that I noticed alot of pains.I was also going through a seperation around this time and I just put the pain down to stress and depression.I first went to the doctor as I was getting pain in and around my ear and i noticed my earlobe would swell and stick out, I can't remember what they told me now but I think I was just given antibiotics?I've been reading up about mastoiditis as I have had pain on the bone at the back of my ear for many years now but I always just thought that was down to stress.I also have a pea size lump behind my ear right at the back and it's painful sometimes but I can only feel it when I pull my ear to the side, I noticed this many years ago but just always thought it was part of my ear and normal but after I've been reading things online I'm not sure?I've also read about facial palsy as my face as felt like it's pulling down constantly and numb not long after the accident.These are a list of problems I have:-Deviated septumBlocked nostrilPostnasal dripSore throatFacial palsyJaw clickingPain in jaw musclesPain in cheekboneHeadachesTender headPainful neck and shouldersEar acheEar lobe sticks outPain back of earLump on ear at backFor many years I've just thought all these things were down to stress and depression but now I'm not sure?I've lived with this pain for 15 years now and it's always there but some days can be worse than other.I wasnt too bad the other day and I went for a walk and the next day my ear was hurting, fullness inside, I holded my nose and blew and my ear popped but it was so painful also my nose was completely blocked, my face was hurting more than usual and my throat was very sore, this happens quite alot.All this has affected my mental health over the years as sometimes my face hurts so much that I find it hard to speak because my face and lip will twitch alot and I feel stupid and embarrassed when talking to People.The pain has caused me to overdose a few times in the past and recently I tried to hang myself as I had enough of the pain and the way it's making me feel.I'm just sick of doctors and specialists constantly fobbing me off, I went to the ENT and they prescribed me nose spray even though I told them I've used it so many times and it doesn't help.What I'm thinking and from what I've read is my deviated septum is causing some kind of infection in my nose, sinuses or eustachian tube and this is then causing a constant ear infection and it has now caused mastoiditis which is also causing my facial palsy, could I be right?I would love to hear from anyone who has experienced same/similar problems.Thanks x"

"Otitis Media","Hi all, i went to an ENT on Monday concerning my tonsils which are both chronically enlarged. He noticed one tonsil was slightly bigger than the other and prescribed me antibiotics (amoxicillin). Ive noticed a slight decrease in the appearance of my tonsil but noticed the other day a small bump behind my ear (on the side with the more normal tonsil). Obviously I freaked out and went to urgent care immediately and was told it was probably a swollen lymph node and not to be worried about it. But I cant help but freak out. Im only 23 years old. It doesnt look like a swollen lymph node, its a very tiny bump and it hurts a little. Any advice would be great. Thank you"

"Otitis Media","I'm not sure where to put this. It's nearly 4am and I'm up because of those issu I've been having since Saturday night.So Saturday I was eating dinner and I suddenly got a sharp pain in my mouth on the left side - under my tongue/my throat. That lasted a little while and then subsided. However, since then uve been left with this horrible sensation like there's a lump in my throat when I swollow. Not only does it feel like a lump but it also hurts my ear/back of throat when I yawn, and the only way I can think to describe it is that the muscles under the left side of my tongue feel extremely tight, and that I can feel that tension in my left ear. It feels almost like if I popped my ear it might help.Also another description is that the muscles under my tongue have gone into cramp to way that the back of my leg sometimes does. Is this possible? If I use my finger to rub under my tongue it slightly feels relieved for a short moment.Does anyone have any idea what this is? I am going to make a doctors appointment, however, it's likely they won't see me for two weeks yet this is effecting me right now."

"Otitis Media","I am hard of hearing and wear hearing aids in both ears.I used to have a few grommits placed in my ears when I was a child and had a few years without them. I then had them put back in again for 2 years befor taking them out and having a T-Bar grommit in my left ear around 4 years ago now. Due to this I may have a hole in my ear canel.Anyway,I started my job in Novemember and since January, each month I've been getting illnesses. I've had 1 week off with tonsilituis and have had 5/6 weeks off due to bad ear infections, my last one was last week where I had both an inner & outer ear infection which caused me to be in agaony to the point where I couldn't eat or sleep for 3 days and was given a cocktail of different medications to deal with this .The ear pain is coming back again a week after but the pain meds i've got are holding it back however this morning , there was a bit of gunk in my ear.I've had a meeting with my work and they are not happy at all.They have 'considered my disability' but is still giving me the last chance to imporve my health or my employment with them will be reconsidered...it doesn't look good. I work in a nursery looking after 2-4 year olds.I take Vitamin D tablets, Iron & Vitamin C tablets as well as Omega 3 tablets ,I eat fairly healthy as my fiance cooks from fresh produce alot and I don't smoke or take any other drugs apart from normal pain meds.I asked my doctors why i get so ill and they said some people have a weak immune system even when prevention methods like the above are put into place.Work isn't happy and even though i've said i keep asking why or to look into it, my work said i'm not trying to give myself better health and that it's unacceptable.What can I do to improve my health?I've asked for Ears,Nose, Throat referral but symptoms improves before the time they said (if it's still bad in 2 weeks we'll see what the next steps are etc)I just feel so stuck as there isn't much i can do about my hearing / ear infections...they think i can just control it as and when i want."

Ive been taking oral antibiotics and also antibiotic ear drops. Things have improved as the pains eased off a lot! And my ears have begun opening up again. However, my hearing hasnt improved all that much if at all. When I pull my ears back I can actually hear for awhile but when I let go they just go back to bad hearing.

"Otitis Media","So about a week ago when going to sleep I noticed I had a constant ringing in my left ear, which I thought nothing of. It wasn't until the morning when the ringing hadn't gone that I started to worry. That was also when I noticed the fullness and slight hearing loss, so I instantly thought it was wax and tried a couple of days of ear drops to try and shift what ever was in there.A week later and I'm still experiencing the same issues. I saw a doctor yesterday who informed me I had a slight external ear infection in the ear which he gave me drops for, as well as eustachian tube dysfunction. Apparently it was the eustachian tube dysfunction that was causing the ringing and fullness. At the time that made sense, as the ear just feels like I need to pop it, and it never pops when I hold my nose and try and blow, but today I was able to pop the left ear, though nothing changed.Does popping the ear not give instant relief of ear ringing? It is really starting to worry me that I have some how caused permanent damage to my ear."

"Otitis Media","Hey folks,I've had crackling in my ears when I swallow or yawn (sometimes when I inhale deeply as well) for years now. Sometimes they also actually pop, which seems to restore some mild hearing loss.In January these sounds were joined by a up until now permanent background musician, named Tinnitus. Now this issue I've read and heard about extensively and I now what can and especially cannot be done about it. That's not why I'm here.Since a few weeks I've also been noticing clicking in my ear when going for a run. This is usually when I have some autophony, meaning that I can feel or hear my own breath in one of my ears.It's like my ears are dealing with a chronic imbalance of inner and outer pressure. They often feel muffled and/or clogged. Popping them does help a bit, but they often will close up again.Mind you, I've never really had any issues with actually opening the Eustachian tubes, which I can do voluntarily (like divers often do).Hope any of you have any ideas what all of this means. Doctors have been useless as of yet.Thanks for reading"
"Otitis Media","End of January my left ear started leaking and smelled really bad. I was given Otomize spray which I thought did the trick. After about 3 weeks it seemed to have started leaking again. I went back to my GP who put me on Otomize spray again.Two weeks later it still hasnt cleared up so I went back to the GP. He then put me on a 5 day course of Amoxicillin. That didnt clear it up so I went back to my GP who took a swab of the inside of my ear to find out what it is (came back with nothing) then gave me a course of Flucloxacillin. My 3rd antibiotic in 4 months.Last month my ear started bleeding so I went to my nearest walk in centre as I was in work and they gave me another antibiotic that Ive forgot the name of now.So after 4 antibiotics Im fairly sure its not an infection as it does not budge at all. Or its got immune to it. Also end of March I lost my hearing in my left ear to barely nothing but thats slowly coming back now. I have been referred to the ENT specialist but waiting on an appointment but no details of whats been happening will be on it as I asked to be referred to them as I also have collapsed eardrums (which Ive had since I was a child).The liquid is yellow in colour.. which can then go more brown. It has a not so pleasant smell to it too.Any ideas what it could be?"

"Otitis Media","Hi All..I was diagnosed with acute otitis media (AOM) which is basically fluid behind the eardrum. Was given a 10 day course of an antibiotic. I have bad headaches, plugged feeling in ears, buzzing in ears (tinnitus) and just generally feeling horrible. The thing is I've read where this ailment in an adult is usually a sign if a more serious problem and an adult is more prone to complications such as meningitis. So I wondered if any members have had this problem as adults and whether antibiotics were prescribed at the time of diagnosis since there seems to be a problem knowing if it's viral or bacterial. My Dr thinks bacterial since I've had symptoms for over 5 days. But now I'm concerned since it could be due to a serious underlying problem causing it. I don't really even know where to go with that since he made no mention of furthur tests or seeing an ENT.Hi All..I was diagnosed with acute otitis media (AOM) which is basically fluid behind the eardrum.

"Otitis Media","About 8 years ago I had a surgery done on my ear that was extremely infected(on my cartilage portion of the ear) they removed the infection and also removed the damaged cartilage as well.All has been well with my ear for the past 8 years. About a day ago, I noticed my ear was kinda sore only upon touching it or sleeping on it. Today I notice that it is warm to the touch. I am extremely nervous that something is happening here. I do not have an ENT doctor has I was a minor when I had this procedure done. I am not sure if I should go running to the hospital or not. Its not pain, just sore. Is this normal with a cauliflower ear??"

"Otitis Media","Got diagnosed with strep throat last week and also had plugged ears so Dr. checked and said I also have an ear infection. Got prescribed 875mg of Amoxicillin for both.The strep went away in couple days but my ears became more plugged and my normally low pitched tinnitus has gotten a lot loader to the point it keeps me up at night and caused me anxiety. I have read that it takes a long time for the fluid trapped in my ears to drain and pop?my ears back open, my question is will the tinnitus calm down as well once the fluid drains?"
"Otitis Media","I have had this problem over and over for years - always the right ear is worse or the only one. Have given up most dairy, have a good diet.Have taken lots of different antibiotics etc and nose sprays and none of it helps.

Got an ear popper which relieves it a bit but then it is bac\k to square one."
"Otitis Media","Hi im new to this, hope you can help, I went to the theatre, it was singing and music , we sat right at front by speaker, my ears the next day are not right, the feel heavy and like I need to pop them..."
"Otitis Media","Mine is a very positive story. I had tinnitus for a year in my left ear. My doctor said there was nothing to be done and I just learned to live with it. No big deal. Then on 25th August 2007, I woke up and couldn't hear anything out of my left ear. I had just moved to Dubai and thought it might be the flight. An ENT specialist did some hearing tests and explained it was nothing to do with the flights as it was an inner ear problem and put me on steroids. They didn't make any difference so I had a gas therapy- I think it's called carbogen - a mixture of oxygen and carbon dioxide. I had this for twelve hours - half an hour on, half an hour off. The next day I woke up and could hear a bit. I was delighted as had resigned myself to no hearing! I then went to the doctor for a repeat hearing test. He said it was good, but he wanted to send me for an MRI scan just in case. I went and when it was nearly finished they injected a dye in. Slightly concerned but thought nothing of it really as knew some of my hearing had come back. I didn't really think much more about it until the doctor's secretary rang to ask that I come in for the results a few days later. Anyway, he told me there was a tumour, 3.2cm by 2.2cm that was usually benign and I had an appointment to see a neuro-surgeon in two days time. It was a big shock, obviously, but I felt like it would be OK and trusted that it was usually benign. The neuro surgeon told me it was an acoustic neuroma and that it was too big for gamma knife. He explained the surgery to me and assured me that he was 99.9% certain it wasn't cancerous. He said it was a fairly big but routine operation but that I would need lots of time to recuperate. I told him I was going to come home to UK and he recommended a surgeon at the Wellington hospital to me. I met with the surgeon who was brilliant. Very calm and kind and told me the risks - 50% chance of facial paralysis, 100% no hearing and what the operation would entail. My tumour was just a bit too big for gamma knife and this surgery had only been carried out for twenty years. This meant any side effects after that time weren't known and as I was only 29, surgery was the way to go. He thought he may have to leave a few mm in because of it's position but that would be OK. He explained it brilliantly and my paretns and I felt calm about the whole thing. On Monday 15th October 2007 I had the surgery. I think it lasted about eight hours as he was able to remove the whole thing. Another surgeon carried out the first part of the operation and the surgeon I'd been recommended did the removal. Both are brilliant and I felt completely at ease and trusted them implicitly. I only vaguely remember coming round about ten hours later. The surgeon said something (I'm sure he said a lot but I can't really remember!) Then my parents came in and I smiled. Perfect smile with no facial paralysis at all. What a massive relief. I remember a bit of the night I spent in ICU and a bit of the next two days in my room. I have never experienced thirst like it!! I had morphine drips and IV and spinal drain (to catch any brain leaks!) Was fairly out of it though. Had a pretty bad night on Tuesday with extra pain injections. My head felt like, well, a bashed in cannon ball really, but once the spinal drain came out things started getting better. I didn't think I would ever feel better as I really did feel rubbish. The surgeon said once the drain was out it would get better and he was right! Wednesday I got out of bed (threw up a bit but felt better after, and was only sick once more through the whole thing), Thursday I walked down the corridor with physio. Was a bit wobbly but OK. Once the catheter was out the walking got easier and by Saturday I was eating, watching TV and walking upstairs. I was taking oral pain medication every four hours and to be honest, I was ready for them, but it was not blinding pain. I had the odd anti-sickness injection or pain injection in between but Saturday was the last injection. Sunday I had a blinding headache again but by the afternoon I felt much better and went outside (my dad wheelchaired me round a park! I could walk, but was just easily tired.) It wasn't the best week of my life but I got better every day and went home the following Monday, just one week later, and was told to take just paracetamol for the pain (I had been having paracetamol and tramadol). I couldn't believe it! A nurse took the stitches out and because my head was still numb it wasn't painful in the least. Just a tiny bit weird really. The scar is all along my hair line behind my ear. They shaved a little bit of my hair in the area but the rest of my hair falls over it and even when I tie my hair back, you can't see it. It's incredible really. (Everyone I've shown it to says how neat and small it is.) At home, I was easily tired and my neck hurt from the position I lay in, my thigh needed penicillin as the scar got infected (they removed some fat from my thigh to put behind the ear where the bone had been! Yuk!)but other than that, my headaches were like the normal ones you sometimes get for no real reason and I could talk on the phone a little bit more each day and my freinds waited until I was ready for visitors. That was after about five days of being home and it was only a few more before I could manage whole days of visits and trips out for lunch! Two weeks later was my 30th birthday and I had a fairly sedate tea party! But the following weekend I was out clubbing (fairly sober as promised myself I would not self induce a headache like the ones I had the first few days of hospital), and felt great the next day. It is now five weeks since the operation and I haven't taken paracetamol for about ten days. I've gotten used to being deaf (bonus is that I get great night's sleep) and my tinnitus is still here. My thigh is numb where the scar is and I can't cry in my left eye (new party trick), but there's drops to help and I'm swimming, jogging, going to yoga, dinners out, drinking a bit of wine and generally thinking life is ace. It really wasn't that bad for me and I feel really lucky. Back to Dubai to carry on with my break dancing lessons in a week or two!

"Otitis Media","Please help. My husband has been hearing a constant low rumble in his ears for the last week or so, mostly at night. At first I thought it was a noise from outside, but I don't know anymore. It's driving him insane, which in turn is driving ME insane. Does anyone have any idea what it might be? Should he see an ENT or a psychiatrist? I don't even know where to start....Thanks in advance!"
"Otitis Media","Hi all! First post here so hopefully some of you may be able to help me.In June I woke up one morning after a loud concert with vibrating in my right ear. Terrified by this I went to an outpatients appointment at my local hospital, and was told that I was suffering from Eustachian Tube Dysfunction and he prescribed some tablets to treat a middle ear condition as well as decongestant nasal spray. With my ears not getting any better, my GP prescribed me a different steroid nasal spray, which did not work. Since this happened, my ears have become progressively worse and now am afflicted with the following conditions.My symptoms are:- Tinnitus in both ears- Right ear Eustachian Tube open at 3mm, left ear Eustachian tube also open (explained below!)- Both ears 'crackle' when swallowing. Some relief offered after yawning as first swallow is sometimes not affected.- Left ear will occasionally 'click' when talking/walking, akin to rice crispies popping.- Right ear will occasionally be affected by autophony - usually during/after walking/exercising but (luckily) short lived, max 10 mins.- Occasional earache at front of ear and across temples- Feeling of pressure- Good hearing but being able to pick up a lot of noises I previously wasn't able to hear/tune in to. Crashing plates etc hurt.On a family holiday to Prague my ears were so bad that I was taken to a medical centre out there and they performed an endoscopy which immediately showed that I had patent Eustachian tubes, with both permanently open - my right at the worst, open to 3mm.However on return to the UK the ENT doctor I saw here was dumbfounded - all the tests they undertook came back that my ears were fine (no hearing loss) and that I didn't have Eustachian Tube Dysfunction (which I knew now) however couldn't tell me what the issue was even though I told him it was Patulous, with evidence of my Prague medical report. He prescribed me a steroid nasal spray (of which I haven't taken after research online of nasal sprays having an adverse effect) and told to come back in 9 months.Earlier this week my autophony was coming back quite intensely and not related to exercise so I'm become really constantly anxious whenever I swallow incase it comes back.Googling my symptoms has left me feeling incredibly low and not knowing how to move forward, or what the future holds for my ears. I've not been able to sleep for nights on end due to the crackling whenever I swallow. It makes it especially worse as I work in music and haven't been to any work events recently due to being concerned for my ears!I would really appreciate it if anyone here could offer me some advice as to moving forward with this condition and how to manage it. Has anyone had similar conditions and how did you deal with them/help?Thank you!"
"Otitis Media","My ear problems, started in the right ear, last appointment I went too said that there is pressure against the eardrum which causes pain all down the right of my face too and basically from time to time the ache and pain goes to the left side, is that because the ears are connected because everytime they check the left side there are no issuesAlso, painkillers don't always seem to work like tonight for example so sleep isn't an option for me right now, so what I ask is do I ignore what the hospital doctor said and go to my doctor to refer me for ENT or do I suffer the extra month (26th May)I must of seen the doctor about 7 times now, and nothing has been done."
"Otitis Media","About 3 weeks ago I got a slap to my ear and it burst my eardrum. I had a doctor check it and it IS perforated. I was perscribed Betnesol-N eardrops (which I have researched and may lead to ear ototixicity?) to prevent ear infections. Today while putting in the drops i felt as if a small amount passed through the perforation and it was followed by a very sharp horrible pain in my ear which lasted a couple of minutes. Should I stop using drops fully and let it recover by itself? If so please drop some tips on how to let it recover as I went for a checki a week ago and it hasn't healed yet!Thanks, Marco"
"Otitis Media","Hi, Im a 16 year old female. I have been having this ringing in my ears for 3 years however Ive learned to ignore it and I didnt ever bother telling anyone about it. About 6 days ago, I was sitting in class and I had just eaten lunch, I started to feel as if the room was spinning so I went to go walk around and I realized that it felt as if I was taking one huge step or like I was sinking and my balance felt off. I went to the docs and they did a neurology exam for me which I passed. They tested me for anemia and diabetes and any other things that can show in my blood and that all came out negative. The docs told me to go home and rest because I also had a fever of 100掳F and my blood pressure kept getting high and low but they assume its my anxiety because when they laid me down, they saw that my blood pressure went down. I went around the internet and searched some of my symptoms up which all linked to vertigo which my doctor hasnt yet diagnosed me with. I am assuming its vertigo but Im also concerned it could be something horrible. Ive been depressed ever since these episodes, I dont like to eat anymore and Ive become lazy in school, this is all starting to depress me.Hi, Im a 16 year old female.

"Otitis Media","My issue is with my ear. its clogged ?and feels like it has cotton in it and then sometimes it has a tingling or draining feeling. It doesnt hurt but its a very annoying feeling. This has been going on for almost three months. Below is the list of items I tried for a month before going to the Urgent Care:1) Over-the-counter sinus medicine2) Zyrtec for allergies3) Nasal rinseWhen I went to the Urgent Care they gave me antibiotics and a prescription for inflammation. Nothing improved or changed. Several weeks later still with no improvement I went to an Ear Nose Throat (ENT) doctor. His staff took lots of tests to see if I had hearing issues, wax buildup, etc. They said my hearing was great and told me to take allegra over-the-counter sinus/allergy medicine and a nasal spray. Since then, I also tired the following:1) Nasal rinse (a couple times per day)2) Hydrogen peroxide drops for 10 minutes then ear wash3) 3-4 Auricular therapytreatments(needleless acupuncture)4) Wearing night guard for teeth grinding at nightPlease let me know if anyone has any ideas or solutions so I can get rid of this ear issue. Its driving me nuts! Thanks so much."
"Otitis Media","Hello Everyone,So short story I had a really bad ear infection that lead to me getting dizziness and nausea which added to my anxiety. Once the infection was gone I still got dizzy here and there and sick so I stopped taking all sinus and allergy stuff I was taking to see if that was it. Some symptoms were because of them but my ears still felt full. I went back to the ENT and he told me that I started clenching my jaw which in turn was making my head hurt, dizzy and my ears full because my jaw was swollen. I would of never guessed that. I now take Excedrin and use a microwavable heating bad for heating with moisture. I still get a little dizzy from time to time no where as bad as it was so it is manageable but I still don't feel comfortable to drive. I was wondering if anyone else has this issue and how do you help with the dizziness and other symptoms? Thank you."
"Otitis Media","Hey guys!From my experience, I noticed that some specialists do not like to be asked too many questions. I would like to know if any of you guys also found it hard to ask doctors questions either directly or via email? I consulted a doctor in Singapore and they only way to get some answers is by asking him questions but he told me that he does not do email consultation and would be best to ask my local specialist back in Australia..."
"Otitis Media","This is not urgent, but is bothering me greatly and has been for a long time. I've been suffering chronic ear problems for years. I'm 19 and I've struggled pretty badly with it as long as I can remember. They get clogged overnight regularly (though usually clear themselves up in the morning.)I also have psoriasis (or maybe exima?) inside of my ears that definitely doesn't help. I dont have a regular doctor, so I have no one to ask questions to.They're constantly clogged and I rarely have full hearing power, at least one ear is ALWAYS acting up to some degree. I have learned to avoid cleaning them no matter how cclogged they feel because I've had so many cripplingly painful ear infections that I literally have dreams about it!! However, occassionally, they are just ridiculously moist and I find it very hard not to try to get the moisture out. I will have an insanely swollen, painful, and leaky ear the next day. I woke up at 1:30 am today for this very reason, so I took some nasal decongestants (a pharmacist told me they might help the last time I had ear pain) and an Advil for the pain. Swallowing, moving my jaw, touching my ear, and cold air all hurt my ear immensely. I can hear throbbing (uugghh) and every time I move my jaw, a horrible bubbly-ish (or msybe like a soft kind of grinding?) noise arises in my ear. There is swelling all down the side of my face, from just below/in frint ig my ear and along the jaw. Ive got a terrible headache in the temple above that ear. Hot shower sometimes alieviates the pain somewhat, but very subtly and very briefly. So much so, I considered it being more of a placebo affect. I've read puting alcohol and vinegar in the ear and then draining it helps, but water gets trapped inside me ear easily and I'm rather hesitant to try. :cI also suffer from, while I don't know what it is, if its normal, or what causes it, but jaw stiffness that seems mostly unrelated to my ears, but causes me to kind of ""crack"" my jaw (by jutting it to the side) which SEEMS to relieve some pressure below my ear, and I'm not sure how much it has to do with my jaw, ear, or both. My jaw definitely moves much easier after I do it, and if my ears are feeling a bit off it seems to help with that too. (I never try while i have bad ear pain though, though, as it is rather excruciating.)Does any of this sound like the problems could be caused by something other than the ear itself? Perhaps a earwax-jaw muscle problem duo working in tandem? Thank you for reading, please share your thoughts. I definitely have ear problems and clogging problems regardless, but I do wonder if something else is working behind the scenes to make it worse. Have a great day, and I hope you are ear-pain free!"

"Otitis Media","Hi, Last Sunday I felt a ear infection coming in my right ear by Monday night my ear was nearly swollen shut and I was pretty deaf. The next day I rang the doctor for an appointment and as usual they had no appointments left and asked me to go to the walk in centre miles away or call back Wednesday.By Wednesday the pain in my ear had gone however it was still swollen and I was deaf. I thought wait it out as it seems to be getting better.Thursday I just cracked on at work still deaf. Friday came and I was really bad I felt rubbish no energy, cold, splitting headache and like I was slightly drunk. I slept until midday Saturday and woke up feeling ok swelling in my ear has gone down however it not completely right. Saturday night my headache came back so I went to bed.I woke up today with no swelling in my ear but still mostly deaf and now with sharp pain in the top of my spine when I move my head forward and backwards. Other than the my current spine pain and slight deafness I don't have any of my previous symptoms.Any ideas, info or advice would be great.Many thanks"

"Otitis Media","Hey all,Okay so last week around Monday, my ear was fully blocked from wax and on that Thursday I got it flushed out using a syringe and warm water. According to the nurse, it all came out but even directly after the fact it got washed out my right ear still sounded muffled and hard to ear, I suspected it was water and waited a few days. Around Sunday, is when I started getting really bad pain and Iinstantly suspected an ear infection, went to the doctor on Tuesday and yep, she said it was an Outer Ear Infection because of swelling in the ear and prescribedmy antibiotics I've been using that ever since but my ear is still blocked and I've been trying to pop my ears by holding my nose and exhaling I can hear a lot of crackling but after a while it just starts to hurt if I try to continue. The doctor did say something about fluid being behind the eardrum when I asked her about the hearing loss. If true, how do I get rid of this fluid cause it's getting extremely annoying?Thanks!"

"Otitis Media","Hello,Everything started when I was driving one day and got very dizzy and nauseous, I pulled over got out and noticed from my anxiety my hands started cramping as well, I somehow called my husband and he called an ambulance that took me to the ER. They did every test you could imagine except check my ears. I felt a little run down after that but it eventually seemed to go away. Fast forward a week I got dizzy again driving luckily my husband was with me, we went to the urgent care and they checked my ears telling me they were red and inflamed and my right ear had a lot of wax. They said the infection must be throwing my balance off along with all the sinus pressure. They gave me a zpac, pregnizone and meclizine for the nausea. A week later not feeling really that much better I went back to them and the infection wasnt gone so they gave me a stronger antibiotic and a steroid shot, I was going on my honeymoon so I really wanted this to help while I was away. For the most part it did but there were times I still felt off and kind of off balance. After my trip I scheduled an ENT visit. He cleaned out my right ear said he no longer saw redness and that my ears looked ok, did audiology tests on my ears they said the results show my ears in the normal ranges for hearing and that it didnt show me having fluid in my ears. As for the off balance he said that would work it self out in time and I should use Flonase for a couple of weeks for the sinus pressure. My ear still feels full and the off balance thing comes and goes and is making me feel nauseous at times. Is this normal? Should I be concerned with the full ear? I am just frustrated and would like to feel normal again. Any suggestions that could help would be awesome thank you."
"Otitis Media","Hello all,I know this discussion has been beat to death but I haven't seen the answers I've been looking for and I've been searching for 3 days.This is my second stapedectomy, the first was 5 years ago in my right ear and everything went great, I had supersonic hearing and no issues that I can remember. Just 4 days ago I had my left ear done and this time around it has been very different. First of all there was no immediate hearing like last time. I still can't hear anything from the outside on my left ear after 4 days, although I do hear my voice louder and it is louder when I scratch my head as well. The one thing that I haven't seen anyone else say is, when I walk I hear a loud sound on every step as if someone is hitting their hand on a microphone.My second most problem that I really worry about is for the first day and a half it was total silence, but then I started hearing a high pitch whine along with some ringing that gets louder when I am exposed to sound such as the tv or music playing. This sound has not went away and I fear I will have to live with it the rest of my life. I am hoping that there is so much packing in the ear is why I can't hear outside noises.

"Otitis Media","About two months ago, I woke up one day and my ear had a clogged feeling to it. Now, my ear has done this two other times before, and it took less than an week to have that ""pop!"" Though, ever since the second time got clogged and popped, my ear clogged every evening when I went to bed, and would pop every morning. One Saturday morning, I woke up and noticed my ear wouldn't pop. I immediately panicked, this would be the third time my ear has done this. Well, much to my dismay of hoping my ear would pop, it still hasn't. At first, I thought I maybe ruptured my eardrum?exposing my ear that particular Friday to my loud music. But that hadn't been the case. One day, I felt ear wax started to come out of my ear, it was kind of a funny 'let me out!' feeling. So, I stuck my finger into my ear and a HUGE clump of ear wax came out. I decided to put some of my wax softener solution in my ear to break down the earwax, but the solution wasn't going down my ear. Upon asking my mother to examine my ear, she had told me I had A LOT of ear wax. So, using the LOOP side of a booby pin, she extracted tons of soft AND hard ear wax that my ear occupied. Then, she proceeded to put the ear solution in my ear, and it felt like a mentos in coke experiment in my ear canal! Aside from that, my mother managed to get a lot of ear wax upon sitting half an hour with the ear solution. Though, ny ear still hasn't popped. Now, I wasn't expecting immediate results, but I gave it a couple of days for my ear to adjust to the new, clean environment, but still nothing! I went to my local physician, and he simply said I still had a lot of ear wax. That day, we tried the ear solution again, and of course, we extracted some old ear wax that I maybe pushed into my ear way back when with a q tip. We repeated the extraction process per the recommendation of the manufacturer of the solution?4 days. We managed to get some ear wax, but recently, it's just recent ear wax. My ear is still super clogged, currently waxless, and STILL ringing! Honestly, I don't even know what's going on with it anymore! Ruptured eardrum? Earwax clogged my eardrum? What is it?! I want to go to an ENT, but (my physician explained what they'd do) all they're going to do is flush the ear wax I probably don't have out. What do I do?! What's wrong with my ear? Will it get better?!"

"Otitis Media","For probably the last 8 months I have had on and off fullness, pain, and congestion in my left ear. I went to an ENT a month ago who said allergies and out me on nose spray. A week later, I was tired of the issue and saw a regular nurse. She said I had fluid in both ears but mostly my left. I did a round of antibiotics and steroids. Nothing changed. I have good and bad days. I have a hard spot under the ear behind where my neck meets my jaw, but it seems to go up and down. I had a head ct a month ago for migraines that was clear, so I imagine if it was a mass it would've been seen. My blood work is also normal. I am on zyrtec as well, but I can't get my ear to pop. It's making me nuts and I don't want another doctor bill. Is it possible it is allergies and my tube is blocked?

"Otitis Media","I had another vertigo attack a couple minutes ago. I was just sitting up in bed watching a YouTube video and BAM the room started to sway! Again, didnt last very long, maybe 10 seconds and then disappeared. I emailed my ENT about the possibility of having Labyrinthitis again a couple days ago, but shes not back in until tomorrow.This doesn't help my brain tumor fears. Even though I did walk around the zoo for 5 hours Monday and not ONCE did I get dizzy and I actually felt better (which is how it was with my first bout of Lab) I figured if I have a brain tumor those 5 hours wouldve been hell?

"Otitis Media","Hi I've had a full feeling in my right ear that comes and goes. I have constant pain deep in the ear all the time. I also get pain that radiates to my face and neck.I have seen an ENT doctor recently. After a few test I was told that I have no infection or fluid in my ear. I had a hearing test that showed my left ear was fine but my right has lost 40% of hearing!I am now awaiting an MRI and follow up appointment with ENT.On top of all this I have been having dizziness and nausea, feeling very tired and headaches only on the right side of my head.The ENT doctor did say it could be a jaw problem and that the muscle in the right side of my neck did feel tense. It does hurt when pressure is put on the area around my ear.I just want answers as to what this could be. Its been like this for about 2 months now. "
"Otitis Media","I got diagnosed with Labyrinthitis after a cold I had at the end of the December by an ENT. I had a hearing test and it came back perfect. My ENT said because of the way my hearing test came out she said it most likely wasnt a brain tumor. In January I went to VRT and the guy I saw did basic neurological tests on me. After those tests I was like So, is it a brain tumor??And he said I definitely do not have a brain tumor! He said I would have more symptoms than just dizziness/off balanced and it would be really bad.Fast forward: My dizziness since then had disappeared by end of January. I had a cold recently and the dizziness/off balanced feeling started again, but this time Im convinced its a brain tumor. I had a weird vertigo attack the other day which absolutely scared the f**k out of me (Ive had vertigo before, but this freaked me out). Everything else is fine, but if Im not dizzy Im worried about getting dizzy. If I am dizzy Im freaking out Im gonna drop dead. I just need some peace of mind! Brain tumor symptoms dont just come and go and I know there would be more wrong, but idk my health anxiety is going CRAZY.Thank you!"
"Otitis Media","5 weeks ago.. I woke up and noticed a fullness in my left ear as if it was full with wax and I couldnt hear properly, everything was muffled, I went to the doctor that week and they said it was blocked. I went to a nurse, they syringed it yet I still couldnt hear. A week later I went back told them I couldnt hear properly still, they sent me to have it syringed again, the nurse however refused to syringe it this time due to history of perforated ear drum. Then it started hurting really bad. I went back to the doctor, they put me on a course of amoxicillin antibiotics for 5 days, nothing happened. Still in loads of pain and the pharmacist put me on cocodamol. I went back to the doctor and she told me to go to a and e to see an ENT specialist as there was nothing more she could do. I went there, had blood tests and swab tests (awaiting results) had micro suction to clear out last bits of wax. Still cant hear. They admitted me overnight but didnt as they didnt get the bloods and swan results in time. So my ear is fully clear.. no sign of infection, and I still cant hear. Theyve put me on a course of antibiotic ear drops for 5 days, 3 days in and no help yet. And I have an ENT appointment in 2 and a half weeks. any idea as to what is going on or any similar experiences?"

"Otitis Media","I had been suffering from tinnitus and hyperacusis for the past 6 months. There were tonnes of faulty diagnoses. Doctors initially thought it was just phlegm accumulated in the eustachian tube for the first 2 months before it became really worse. My office had a 4khz alarm that just kept on making it worse and worse. None of the medicines worked and finally last month I just took some time off to a calm place for a week and it reduced a lot. Now I removed all medicines, had been doing yoga, playing flute, singing, swimming and playing tennis for the past 1 month and all of them help reduce ear pressure like feeling (especially when I take a deep breath or rotate my shoulders). What I did find during this period was that my ears/nose reacts very adversely to wysolone/Prednisone/asthalin/seroflo. It causes a feeling of clicky/cloggy feeling in my ears. Like I keep hearing a clicking sound (like water dripping) whenver I swallow saliva for a few days after taking any of those steroids. When I stopped these medications the clicky symptoms were completely gone. Since then I refused to take those medicines which my doctor mother force administers me. During these two months she forced me asthalin once, and yesterday she forced me wysolone both of which returned the clicky feeling. It's been 12 hours since I took wysolone 10mg and the clicky feeling has not gone away yet. It also affects my abdomen.One of the bigger reasons why it was hard for doctors to diagnose was because the symptoms were eccentric. Tinnitus changed in intensity from time to time, hyperacusis also changed, but there were a host of other symptoms which came and went from time to time and I can now attribute them to a host of medicines I took. Those symptoms include - a constant pressurized feeling in and loss of low frequency hearing my left ear for two months, clicky (water dripping sound in my ears) especially after a horn exposure, changes in sensitivity for sound (from being unable to bear a horn from 20 metres away to being able to bear it without earplugs within a couple of metres), varying tinnitus with varying frequency bands. Most of those got resolved in this last 1 month before I took wysolone which returned the clicky feeling and a feeling of nasal blockage."
"Otitis Media","Can you get Lab again? I got diagnosed back in December with Labyrinthitis after a cold I had (Diagnosed by a GP but also an ENT) after a month I was okay. Well, I had a cold almost 2 weeks ago and for the past couple days (since the 22nd) Ive been feeling that off balanced feeling once again and my eyes have felt strained like they used to. I havent read much about being able to get again? Has anyone experienced getting it again? Im worried its a brain tumor or something else"
"Otitis Media","I was diagnosed with Labyrinthitis back in December after having a cold. It got way better by January and the off balanced feeling/dizziness went away.I just recently had a cold once again and about 7 days into the cold (congestion was my only symptoms at that point) I started to feel the off balanced feeling once again. Im still wondering if thats due to residual dizziness from Lab? If anyone else has had Lab and then experienced that sort of thing, let me know!The off balanced feeling has still been around for the past couple days, but its easier to ignore because I dealt with it for awhile. Today I was sitting watching TV and I noticed it was hard to focus on the TV like it was when I had Labyrinthitis back in December. I started to test it out and leaned my head back to look up at the ceiling and then down quickly to see if I would get dizzy, I did a little. I ignored it. 15 minutrss later I felt what I describe as vertigo but 5x worse. It only lasted for a couple seconds. It was like the room and myself shifted, but I didnt move. It felt like a wave went through my body and the room went all weird. Immediately I went into panic mode and my body just detached itself so now at the moment Im having crazy derealization and depersonalization because of how terrifying that was.Im not sure what it was? I dont know if its from my cold and my Labyrinthitis that was gone is now rearing its ugly head? Or I have a brain tumor? Ive read that brain tumor symptoms dont just get better and my off balanced feeling got better and disappeared. Ive been to an ENT (end of December) and had a hearing test (no MRI) and the way my hearing test results came out was that I had symmetrical hearing?so she put brain tumor?as possible culprits on the bottom of the list because of it. I also went to VRT (in middle of January) and the guy there who has patients that have brain tumors, had me do basic neurological tests and even he said you definitely dont have a brain tumor, you would have more symptoms and they would be badIm just confused and upset. Im still currently freaking out because this did just happen 40 minutes ago. If ANYONE can give me some peace at mind on this, that would be appreciated."

"Otitis Media","Hello everyone,About 3 days ago I was at work and started getting flu symptoms. Then later on I started to get pretty painful headaches and earaches I both ears, I left work early and slept for 21 hours. I woke up later feeling ill but the earache had gone away. Later on in slept from 18 more hours.Now today things havent taken a turn for the worst. My cold is feeling much better but I started to get severe pressure buildup In my right ear, the pain was pretty much toxic. I tried cotton wool, heat, hot and cold balm, noting really worked. I had constant popping that caused unbearable pain. Later on I had one final pop which although didnt hurt too much it also didnt go completely. Now it just feels like a dull pressure. I started taking fluxoccilin I think it is. But about an hour after the same thing has stated happening in the other ear, its even worse pain than before Im in tears. Ive taken codeine, Sudafed max, ibuprofen and naproxen which has only taken the edge of the pain. I dont understand whats happening.Could this be an ear infection? How has the pain gone so severe from one ear to the other just like that?? Its so painful and its not wax buildup. I havent had an ear infection in years but I cant tolerate this pain...Should I see my gp? SomethingDoesnt feel right but Im worried its stupid"

"Otitis Media","Hi everyone ,Ive been to my ENT a couple of weeks ago for a throat infection (I see him for allergy problems as well) anyway , Ive been constantly feeling like there is fluid moving in my ears (specially the left one ) . Its been happening way before the infection so he did a test of the middle ear (I forgot the name) but it measures the pressure and acoustic reflex .The results showed that my pressure was within the normal range but slightly down *i have no idea how to post a pic* .But what was shocking is that the acoustic reflexes in my right ear were bad even tho all my problems were in my left one . He repeated the test and the same results showed . He said its irrelevent and might be an old issue So he decided to send me to an audiologist whom Im going to see in a couple of weeks .Did anyone went through the same ? Is it something that I should be worried about ? And what should o expect in my appointment?Thanks in advance ."
"Otitis Media","Hi,So at the beginning of February I started with a heavy cold/flu like symptoms and 2 days later I woke up with horrific pain in my ears and I couldn't hear at all. I went to out of hours and they told me I had bilateral otitis media and told me to take 4x ibuprofen 3 times a day. I did this when I got home but then shortly after I started being sick. I went back to the out of hours the next morning and they gave me amoxicillin, cyclazine for the sickness and codeine for the pain. I continued for another 3 days in agony, being sick, and completely deaf. I went back to gp and they gave me different antibiotics and tramadol. After another 2 days of agony and being sick I went back again and the gp finally rang ENT at the hospital and I had to go in. I got admitted and had 48 hours of i.v antibiotics. I got discharged with an appointment to see the ENT specialist 2 days later. I went and they said they would drain the fluid and put grommets in. I had this done 2 days after this appointment. Now 2 weeks on I still feel everything is muffled. I have HORRENDOUS whooshing sounds, high pitched screaming tinnitus and low rumbling sounds in both ears plus pulsating sensations. I rang the surgeons secretary and wanted some reassurance that this was normal, so he got me back in last week. I had another hearing test and my hearing has improved slightly (which I can tell) but he just gave me a leaflet on tinnitus and said I should have an MRI scan. I don't feel like I've been given any help and I'm starting to get very depressed. I can't sleep because of the noises and if I do manage to drift off, I'm often woken through the night. It's affecting everything I do. I feel very isolated and scared that this is now my life. My distance hearing is massively affected at the minute. Before all of this I had perfect hearing. I just want to know if what I'm experiencing is normal and if it will settle down? Sorry for the long post, I wanted to give the full picture.

I went back to the out of hours the next morning and they gave me amoxicillin, cyclazine for the sickness and codeine for the pain. I continued for another 3 days in agony, being sick, and completely deaf. I went back to gp and they gave me different antibiotics and tramadol. After another 2 days of agony and being sick I went back again and the gp finally rang ENT at the hospital and I had to go in. I got admitted and had 48 hours of i.v antibiotics. I got discharged with an appointment to see the ENT specialist 2 days later. I went and they said they would drain the fluid and put grommets in. I had this done 2 days after this appointment. Now 2 weeks on I still feel everything is muffled. I have HORRENDOUS whooshing sounds, high pitched screaming tinnitus and low rumbling sounds in both ears plus pulsating sensations. I rang the surgeons secretary and wanted some reassurance that this was normal, so he got me back in last week. I had another hearing test and my hearing has improved slightly (which I can tell) but he just gave me a leaflet on tinnitus and said I should have an MRI scan. I don't feel like I've been given any help and I'm starting to get very depressed. I can't sleep because of the noises and if I do manage to drift off, I'm often woken through the night. It's affecting everything I do. I feel very isolated and scared that this is now my life. My distance hearing is massively affected at the minute. Before all of this I had perfect hearing. I just want to know if what I'm experiencing is normal and if it will settle down? Sorry for the long post, I wanted to give the full picture. Thank you"
"Otitis Media","2 weeks ago my ear got blocked so I used earwax for few days and then washed is with water bought in pharmacy.That not helped so I went to surgery to synergie that ear but I was told that it might be infection and received antibiotic ear drops.That nothing changed.Still my ear is blocked , there is this hissing sound in my ear but no ear pain at all.Can one have ear infection without pain? Should I just go again and ask for ckeaning my ear from wax?"
"Otitis Media","I've seen a lot of discussions that are sort of similar to my issue but not exactly. A week ago I had a cold with lots of congestion and had to travel on a plane. When the plane landed my right ear popped but the left felt all clogged, so I plugged my nose and gently blew. Nothing happened. I tried again a couple hours later - again, just a gentle blow, not violently - and my ear ""popped"" with a sharp shooting pain. But it didn't get rid of the clogged feeling.It's been a week and my left ear still feels full, clogged, and muffled. No pain but minor ringing at times. I don't think I have an earwax buildup. I'd estimate that my hearing in that ear is at 50-70% of its normal capacity. My congestion in my nose/throat has totally cleared up by now. I've tried yawning, swallowing hard, stretching the outer ear, chewing gum, etc. - all the techniques for getting your ears to pop - but nothing has made them pop again or cleared the blocked feeling.I'm worried that when I ""popped"" that ear I actually ruptured my eardrum. Beyond seeing a doctor as soon as I can (I'm still traveling for the next week), is there any way to identify what's going on? Or how to fix it??"
"Otitis Media","I have had Otitis External for over 7 months now and permanent buzzing in ear. I have had 5 courses of antibiotics, 2 courses of otomise and. 3 different antibiotic ear drops. The pain now is on the right side of my neck and radiating along my jawline. I have also seen an ENT consultant privately and he diagnosed a ear canal infection. My right cheek is also swollen. "
"Otitis Media","I am 17 years old and I have super mild balance issues. I'm not the most steady on my feet (I am easily knocked off balance), though it doesn't really affect most activities like walking and such. However, recently I was in a beginner dance class with some friends and I noticed that I struggle MUCH more with spotting on turns than my peers.I also recently found out that I had a left ear infection at 5 months old. Since it was at such a young age, could that infection have had a long-term effect on my balance?"
"Otitis Media","I'm now into the 8th month of what I think is vestibular neuritis (I've never had a proper diagnosis) but it is really getting me down.Unlike a lot of people it didn't start with a bad spinning episode, in fact I've never had spinning or dizziness. Mine started with a very slight feeling of imbalance and wobblyness, feeling like I was walking on a boat, then over a month or two I began to get other symptoms like mild tickling, soreness and a blocked feeling in one ear and head fog. By far the worst symptom has been the head fog, which is so difficult to describe and cope with, Like feeling drugged or not quite 'in the world'. I've also had a few episodes of almost fainting, ongoing lethargy and loss of appetite, sometimes feeling sickly and bloated, all of which have only presented since the ear problem arose. Over Christmas, after one fainting episode I felt like I had a tight band around my neck, both ears were burning inside, severe head fog and wobbling, severe lethargy and pins and needles in my limbs for a week as well as shortness of breath.This has really affected my life and I feel like it will never get better. I've been to the GPs umpteen times and there doesn't seem to be any help available. After a battle I was referred to ENT but I'm still waiting on an appointment. So far I've had blood tests, a few ECGs, blood pressure, balance / neuro tests and all have been normal. Anxiety is a huge problem as I fear something happening when I'm out (especially fainting) and I find it hard to concentrate at work. I've taken a lot of time off sick and can't take any more. Haven't driven since it all started and feel like a shadow of my former self as life is so restricted. I do have occasional days when I'm symptom free but they are rare. Please tell me there is light at the end of the tunnel!"

"Otitis Media","Hi,I'm 36-year old male and about 3-weeks ago I went to my doctor with typical flu-like symptoms. He informed me I had a Respiratory Tract Infection and prescribed some antibiotics and pain killers which I took over the course of the following week. The problem did not clear-up and, after developing a chesty cough and severe pain in one ear, I returned to the doctor who then told me the infection had most likely spread to my chest and most certainly in to my ears - particularly my left one. He prescribed stronger antibiotics and pain killers and a nasal steroid spray, all of which again I took religiously over the following week once again.Although my cough and general flu symptoms have pretty much cleared up, for the past week or so I have been left with almost complete loss of hearing in my left ear. It feels as if there's still a wee bit of pressure both in and around the ear itself with a sort of numbness when i touch the skin on my face and head around the ear. This extends in to my hair-line, over my left cheek and a short distance down my neck below my ear. There's also a small amount of ringing from within the ear and it sounds as if I'm hearing things ""internally"" all the time. Hard to explain but extremely frustrating and my concern is that the infection has somehow managed to damage my hearing permanently.Can anyone offer any advice please?Thanks in advance!!Gavin"
"Otitis Media","The doc gave her some cortisone cream which didnt really help, she only used it for about 1 week as advised. We tried the following, sesame oil with garlic, onions, coconut oil (all mixtures as advised on other authority med sites).I'm uploading 2 pics and hope someone can help us understand better how to heal it.Any help is greatly appreciated."
"Otitis Media","i have a pounding in my ear that sounds like my heart beating !has anyone had this problem?"
"Otitis Media","Ive recently had a cold and my ears are quite clogged up. This never usually happens and I dont get sick often. Im worried because even as the cold symptoms pass both my ears are still quite blocked. They were quite bad in the beginning (painful and super blocked) but some antihistamines and generic cold meds took the pain and intensity away. There was no pain over the next few days and it has improved a little since then. I took a short course of antibiotics and sudafed for a day or two (and stopped the other medication). Not much difference. They arent *extremely* blocked - I can still hear alright but its just irrititating. I find myself avoiding social situations because Im not 100% sure how loud im talking. When i swallow there are popping sounds which didnt happen before. And I can pop them when i hold my nose and exhale gently but this doesnt really make a difference. Ive read so many horror stories about edt and it seems to last for months/years for some people....I really cant imagine going through that. Its terrible. I usually get over a cold in a few days and have never experienced anything like this with my ears before. Its been a week and a bit. Steam makes it a tiny, tiny bit better, and its usually most blocked when i wake up.Id just like to know of this sounds like edt at all or just a cold symptom. I may be overreacting but its just so frustrating. What are some subtle signs of improvement i should look out for? Thanks"
"Otitis Media","Hi EveryoneNeed some advice as doctors say my condition is a rare case.I was diagnosed with an Acoustic Neuroma in 2013 at the age of 29 years.Has anyone been through 4 times surgery to remove tumor only to find out after 25 radiation treatments that the tumor has grown from 4.1cm to 4.7cm in a year.

I have next to no Idea what is wrong. I thought my ear tube was clogged, so Ive taken anything from anti-hysteminans to decongestants and it didnt help.

"Otitis Media","I went to the doctor to get my ears checked because they still felt full four weeks after my cold. One of them the nurse said looked fine and the membrane?was shiny. The other was too full of wax for her to see so she had to irrigate it. I know that ear canal is a little narrow, but she was looking around and said she still couldnt see the membrane. She called the doctor in and the doctor said I mightve torn it. She also said I shouldnt worry and it would heal by itself in a couple of months, but after looking on the internet, that seems wrong to me? Am I right in thinking that the membrane is my eardrum and if they couldnt see it, it must be completely gone, not just torn? And wouldnt I need surgary? Also, wouldnt it have been dangerous to irrigate an ear with a ruptured eardrum?"

"Otitis Media","I am going through with my decision to get hearing aids. I want to keep you guys posted on my story. I know i posted a topic about a question if hearing aids are worth it and somebody gave a HUGE thumbs up. Can't mention who for security reasons as I'm not sure they want me to mention their names. I have no permission to do so.I have had many hearing tests (can probably do one in my sleep lol) but I often left the places because they had the bedside manner of a fish, I was told over the phone with a place i had been before to get a hearing test to be forwarded to a specialist at one point that based on the description of my hearing loss i will likely need a Behind the ear one, They are still going to do the test though. They pretty much have to she said.I have 50 percent hearing loss in the left ear an 30 percent in the right ear. Due to ear surgeries and ear infections as a child. i had a very bad case of sinusitis 3 years ago and another bad ear infection so I wouldn't be surprised if that attributed to another drop of it. I am in my 30's, early and the secretary on the phone said i could even have coloured choices if i want! There go the days when colour in hearing aids was only meant for children. I you-tubed and there are many adults with coloured aids. I got a booked hearing test on the 15th of February (I'm Canadian if any of you wish to know) I used to have an older pair of open fit hearing aids but no matter how loud i turned 'em up i can't hear out of them and out of curiosity i tried them on last night and put my finger over the hole of the open one and could hear! They were horridly uncomfortable and pinched so I will be getting a new pair! I couldn't stand them for more than five minutes last night though! I am supposed to bring them for the assessment so they can gauge why i didn't like them.They're likely going to be a full ear bowl hearing aid behind the ear version from what the secretary on the phone said (i think that's the term) I have also heard that even these aren't as heavy weight as they used to be. Is this legit for any of you who might be willing to answer my question on this? The modern versions anyways. Anything takes time to get used to but i am curious nonetheless."

"Otitis Media","HiIt's difficult to write this because of the pain.18 months ago I was on a flight, when the flight was descending I had the most excruciating pain in both my ears for around 10 minutes. After the flight my ears didn't feel right but there wasn't any lasting pain.3 weeks passed and I had a clogged pressure sensation build up in my ears. I went to an ENT Doctor and he looked in my ears and said they were severely retracted. After a few months the ENT doctor said the ear drums looked normal.The pain in my ears has not changed. It feels like a dull/pressure/ clogged type of pain. Since the flight I have been unable to fully yawn which I believe is related. Every month or so I can taste a small amount of pus drain down the back of my throat. The pain is truly unbearable, I would rate it a 9 out of 10, and I don't know what to do.Any advice or help would be really appreciated Thank you"

I just want to make sure this seems somewhat normal for have an earinfection and will lessen as the infection subsides. I've never had this happen and it's bothering me. ThanksMatthewHi everyone this morning after 4 hrs of intense pressure from a new earinfection after I saw the Dr. My drum ruptured.

"Otitis Media","i have had ringing in my ears most of my life, i had tubes in my ears when i was a baby, i have used q-tips most of my life for cleaning deep in the ear canal. thats short for my ear health and habits. i do struggle sometimes to hear certain words, ive noticed especially with words that start with M or N or other similar sounds"
"Otitis Media","Good afternoon,I really hope someone out there can give me some advice and let me know that this fight isn't getting the better of me...Last year i had a perforated right ear drum after a bought of sinusitis. The pain was horrific but after the initial burst seemed to die down. I was however deaf for a few weeks in that ear. When it cleared up i felt back to normal. That was until 5am UK time on Thursday 2nd Feb this week... I was awoke by that same horrible feeling of Ear ache and something bad was going to happen. It felt like it popped. Little bits of liquid started to come out. Then a few hours later after some Paracetamol the left ear did the same. We rang the G.P. No help as per usual. At this point my partner was doing all the talking. I felt awful and like death with a fever. She decided to ring out of hours gp services at the local hospital and a doctor there decided to see me. I wasnt really capable of getting there but my partner helped carry me to the car. Felt so weak. After discussing symptoms with my partner and looking in both ears he said it was Otitis Media. I could have worked that out. But in fairness he did take the time to get me some antibiotics. It is now Sunday 17:00 and i have no pain on my ears apart from being around 80% deaf and constant tinnitus.My hearing in one ear has never been great and i think i have suffered with extremely mild tinnitus since i was 17 i think... im 33 now. I am having boughts of fever every 6-8 hours. These get really horrible and make me feel like giving up i dont see any real progress.Im taking Ibuprofen x 2. Ive had three lots today so will have to go back to Paracetamol. Im taking 500mg Amoxicillin every 8 hours. Im also take 10mg MST morning and night for Sciatica. Accompanied with 300mg Gabapentin 3 times a day and Oramoprh 5ml/10mg once a day. Please help. Will my ears go back to normal?Are my fevers normal? Taking medication drops them again. I can kind of tell when i need medication as i start getting cold and hot.I feel useless. Havent moved much in 4 days and feel like I'm in a vicious circle. Is this something more serious i should think about?"
"Otitis Media","I had my heart checked before. Im 47 in great shape. Even had ekg, and the xrays taken on my heart valves.No history of heart issues in family.My question is, if i get on the treadmill or run i can get my heart rate up 130 or so plus.If I do a quick sprint here and there up stairs or 30 yards. My heart rate still stays fairly low like 80-90. But I have to catch my breath like its beating hard. I know there is a relation to heart rate and breathing hard, but how come it doesnt go up in those situations and I have to catch my breath for a few minutes?Any know about this. Granted the cardeologist said it may be something to do with signals from lungs to heart?Thanks!"
"Otitis Media","I've had a pulsing sensation in my right ear for 2 or 3 years now. For some reason I never thought it to be a huge concern. About a month in a half ago I started having a constant high pitch ringing in the same ear so I decided it was time to see an ENT. When I told him about the pulsing sensation he was much more concerned about that (rightfully so I see now). He told me it could be a tumor, atherosclerosis, aneurysm, and all kinds of anxiety inducing possibilities. I asked him if there were any possible less serious causes and he said could be hearing loss.So he set me up with a hearing test, an MRA of the neck and MRI of the brain. So far I've had just the hearing test, the MRA/MRI is not until Tuesday but I have the results of the hearing test. Just as a precursor, I have a history of multiple environmental and food allergies, had tubes in my ears at age 6 and have for years had issues with dizziness, anxiety and ear problems.The doctor who did my hearing test explained to me that my left ear is perfect, pressure test normal, audio test normal. When she did the right ear the pressure test came back abnormal, showing what she said to be some kind of interference in the ear, she said could be most likely fluid with my history but could be other things. I had some hearing loss in the right ear but when she put this weird head piece on me that bypassed the ear canal and sat under my ear she said that came back perfectly fine. She said if it's fluid like she thinks that once it's taken care of it could rid me of the ringing and the pulsing, some anxiety and dizziness. This made me feel quite a bit betterAfter this wall of text, my questions are:Why didn't my doctor tell me that fluid in the inner ear could be a possibility? Is it truly something that can cause pulsatile tinnitus?Does this test result rule out something like atherosclerosis or a brain aneurysm?I have anxiety issues, there's no doubting that. I just want to know if the hearing test rules out some causes that could potentially be serious. Thanks for your help"
"Otitis Media","On Monday I could feel pain in my right ear but thought it was a ear pimple, then later that night I was very sleepless from the discomfort this pain gave me. The next day I went to the doctors and he gave me ear drops, which felt like they made my ears worse because then my left ear got infected. I can't hear out of both of my ears, only loud noises I can just hear. I went back to the doctors and seen three doctors, they have me on Panadol for my temperature, nurofen for pain and antibiotics, they also seem like they aren't helping either.

"Otitis Media","Some background about the problem: I have never been on a plane, scuba diving, or done any activities damaging to my ear except listen to loud music (though I try to keep the volume regular.) As far as I know, I have never had an ear infection in my life. I also dont have severe sinus problems and have not been facing anything that could be a sinus issue except pressure in my head and behind my eyes the past couple days. I clean my ears with Q-tips but thats all. I havent had a cold in months and my tonsils have not been removed. I do have braces though, and this has started after I got my wire changed so I think it could be this. However I want a second opinion.The first time I felt my ear pop in a while was a month ago, around the 4th when I blew my nose a little too hard and my left ear popped. This was all I felt in my ear for a little bit after, and for the rest of the month I cant recall having any problems.However, on the 4th of January (This month) my ear popped again after lightly blowing my nose in the bathroom. I felt fullness in my ear and like my ears had pressure in them. Both ears this time. I felt it and tried to swallow and try othermethods I found online to try and pop them to no avail. Defeated, I gave up and hoped it would quit on its own. It did for a bit, but it was full and felt like they filled up and crackled on and off for the next couple days.Things got worse as of two nights ago. Around 8:00 p.m. my ears randomly started crackling and filling up and I thought I was going to lose my hearing. I did have muffled hearing for a little bit but that was brief. It went away after a couple seconds, but the fullness and pressure came back on and off throughout the night. It didnt muffle my hearing like it did the first time, but it still hurt and confused me.As of yesterday, my ears got worse. They were okay in the morning but as the day went on they started to hurt a bit more and feel a little like they were burning from the pressure. They felt full and crackled a bit as well, but my hearing wasnt muffled until I woke up about 40 minutes ago and I couldnt hear for a couple seconds. I can hear fairly well now (can hear myself speak) and I can feel the veins behind my ears really well when I crack my left cheek/swallow.As I type this, I can feel the veins behind my ears on both sides of my head. I have the fullness feeling in both ears but more so the right. Both have a little bit of the sensation I described earlier. I am also not experiencing any dizziness or vertigo from my ears being messed up.I dont have a clue why this is happening. Like I said, no history of ear infections. Havent had a cold in months and barely any sinus issues. I think it could be from my braces (tinnitus) but Ive heard that people who had it from that also had jaw clicking, if I have that ive never noticed. The only possibilities I can think of are my braces, tonsils, or somehow sinuses. Has anyone else experienced this and should I make an appointment to the ENT before its too late?"
"Otitis Media","Dizziness now constant and very severe if my head is tilted back as in looking at top shelf in shops, also cannot lie down without room spinning unless on left side. Unable to get any answer from my doc. Can anyone tell me if this is normal for a neuroma please. Thank you"
"Otitis Media","It started 3 weeks ago during a cold/sinus infection that had me very congested, to the point where I would blow my nose and it would come out of my eye. It is in my right ear, and it sounds like a high pitched white noise. It is noticeable in quiet settings, so I hear it when I try to sleep at night. My parents don't seem to be concerned about it, but I feel like this is very concerning. I don't understand what would cause it, other than the cold but I'm thinking it might be more likely that I have a brain tumour as it won't go away. For some background information, I had bronchitis with ear popping issues all December and November but never ringing. And I have had a few cold/sinus issues lately. Sometimes I try to pop my ears, but either nothing happens or the ringing gets louder/ changes pitch. Do I need to immediately see a doctor? And is this likely caused by a serious issue like a tumour?

"Otitis Media","Hello, I am a 15 year old girl and currently i have a flu. And i know that because there is a blockage in your nose or something that there will be some kind of ringing in your ears when you have a flu. But this time its so loud that i cant sleep. I actually havent slept in over a day. I know for some people that is nothing, but since I have a flu its really taking a toll on my body. I'm not sure if I have tinnitus, it could be possible since i take music classes in my free time (to be specific, i play percussion) so maybe i have tinnitus, but i think this is because of the flu. The only way to drown out the noise is with really loud music. Ive tried sleeping to a movie but the noise from the movie cant drown out the beeping. Also i tried doing the blowing out while pinching your nose thing, and it only worked on my right ear so it made it so much more uncomfortable.

"Otitis Media","About 8 months ago, I went to our family doctor to complain about my ears feeling full. It just sort of feels clogged, and I thought it was earwax. However, my ears were pretty clean, so I was prescribed antihistamine to relieve it. It obviously didn't work, but I soon got used to the feeling and momentarily decided to ignore it. Then three months later, the ringing started. I don't know if ringing is the right term, but if you can describe how an image of a sound wave sounds like-- that's probably it. The ringing isn't constant but it happens at least once or twice a week. Then about 2 months ago, I woke up feeling faint. It was bad enough that I would fall over if I move my head too fast or if I tilt my head downwards. I thought it was just a thing that happens because I haven't been sleeping well. So I let it go. A week after that, it got better in a way. I can now walk straight without collapsing on the floor, but something still feels wrong with my body. Now, I'm in a weird state of dizziness all the time. I have to rest constantly and lean on things to stop myself from falling down. My sense of balance was never great, but it got significantly worse.About 8 months ago, I went to our family doctor to complain about my ears feeling full.

"Otitis Media","Hello everybody,This is my first time posting here and I'm sure the symptoms I describe wont be much different than what you've seen already. I just feel typing out my message will help me cope a little bit and gain a sense of sanity back into my life (lol).I've had ear issues for quite a long time. About 12 years ago I was suffering from strep throat and had a plane ride back home from Texas. Something about that flight set me up for years of ear issues that I can't really explain to well.Like a lot of you, my issues ""USUALLY"" come around in the winter months and get much worse after a sinus infection. The issues include complete ear blockage, cracks and pops that don't lead to any type of relief, hearing loss etc. I've found that it's equally a combination of getting the cold but I've had tonsillitus/strep throat over 15 times in my life so I'm not sure if my tonsils have something to do with it. Anyways, back to my problem...Last week I got the obvious signs of sore throat, neck pains and a tickle in my ear. I decided to attack this before it got terrible and made my way to the urgent care (due to not having a primary care doctor). I was diagnosed with tonsillitus and an ear infection in my left ear. I'm on day 10 of Amoxicillin and intermittently taking sudafed (with a switch off of mucinex) and I'm experiencing things I've never experienced before.It's day 10 and I've had constant tinnitus in my left ear. This used to come and go once every few months in the past and was never really anything that was apparant (out of sight out of mind). The last 10 days it has made its presence known in that it's so extremely deafoning that I need white noise/background noise to get any type of relief.Also, in the past after 4 or 5 days my ears would unplug and I'd have decent hearing and be able to manually open my eustachian tubes (a weird technique that I used, hard to explain) which isn't working right now. Since Tuesday, the extreme fullness issues have extended to my right ear as well and nothing seems to give relief. I can hear my ears pop but it does nothing to relieve the pressure that I'm feeling. The feeling I can be attribute it to is having seashells or noise cancelling headphones over your ears at all times.I'm starting to think it's time to make another Doctor's appointment but I'm starting to think it's useless after reading all of your comments/problems/concerns over the past 10 days.Has anybody experienced what I am currently and have any words of advice? thank you so much."

"Otitis Media","Hey Everyone,I hope someone out there can shed some light on the situation I'm in as I honestly am losing the will to live at this moment. In early August this year, I had severe dizziness in which I almost felt like I was going to collapse. Happened for no reason at all (I did bang my head2 weeks before on a shed door - not sure if that's linked at all).I'm only 24, healthy adult, never had any problems before, but ever since that day, I had been getting progressively worse with the dizziness, nausea and been numerous times through A&E, felt like I honestly was going to die. Anyhow, I managed to get through it up till this day and feeling a lot less dizzy (manageable) but about a month or so after in SeptemberIstarted tohear a loud high pitch noise that's refusing to shift even now. ENT said its Tinnitus and wanted to find out why I had the dizziness, they think it was Labyrinthitis (GP also said that to). So they did a hearing test to rule out a few things like Meniere's/Hearing loss, the hearing results came out 100% and they said I could hear even a pin drop! Now they want to make sure its nothing serious so just been for an MRI of the ""internal acoustic meatus"" whatever that means but awaiting the results.My query is, will this loud high pitch noise (Tinnitus?) that's in my head ever go away? Was it a result of my head injury right back in July? If I plug my ears right now or cover them, I feel the noise is coming from within the brain. I have tried that Tinnitus relief that was to join your middle fingers on the base of the skull and use the index to tap but that didn't do anything, however, I noticed a completely different noise from the left ear compared to the right ear whilst tapping, not sure if that's helpful to know.GP said it would go away within a few weeks, but its been 4 months almost. Is there any light at the end of the tunnel.Thanks in advance for any replies! Kind Regards, Cal"
"Otitis Media","I have an extremely uncomfortable ear condition and I cant get relief. It started with vertigo and hearing sensitivity over a month ago. I went to the doctor and was given exercises and sent on my way. A week later the vertigo got worse and I went back to the doctor and he said I had a bulging ear drum and treated me with antibiotics and prednisone. A week later I have a feeling of fluid and fullness in my ear. It is very uncomfortable. I ent to an ENT who said they dont see anything, but gave me a higher dose of prednisone and I was told to give it time. After the prednisone I still had the feeling and was given a3rd round. During all this I have on and off vertigo. Any ideas who it could be? I am so uncomfortable!"

That feeling but it doesnt have that good sensation of it just going away. Oh yes a nurse checked my ear and there is no wax just a bit of fluid which I have had before but she doesnt think thats the problem. I dont think there is any more to say but thank you if you are reading this.Hi, so I think last week or something I put my headphones on and when I took em off I felt this blocked feeling so I thought it would go away in a couple of seconds but it didnt so I put both my fingers on my nose and blew which usually works but that didnt but 2 days or maybe more after, I was in the bathroom and I yawned and I got even more blocked ear, it now feels like when you dive in a swimming pool and come back up.

"Otitis Media","Forgive me if the writing does not seem like a personal request, I have been copy/pasting this across forums and other health care websites trying to receive help.TL;DRExcruciating pain in ears during airplane descent, and throughout the whole night after landing. I'm not talking about airplane discomfort, I'm talking about having knives being twisted deep into your ears. I'm talking about having your jaw in a vice, tightened to the point just before your bones snap. I've broken bones before... my leg, fingers, toes, and wrist... that pain was nothing compared to this. Help!-------------------------------Two nights ago I returned from my 10 days in California (Lompoc, if you're familiar), visiting family. The flight there was a straight flight from STL Missouri to LA California. The flight there went smoothly, with my normal ear discomfort, and I was able to pop and relieve my ears multiple times throughout the flight. The flight went just as all of my flights have, just fine with no problems (I've been flying on airlines since I was 6 years old. I flew twice a year until I was 16, and then I only flew 4 times between the ages of 17-19... and now at twenty years old this was my latest flight).I had fun in California, but a few days before I left I started to get a runny nose. I had a runny nose for the last 3 days before I left. The flight leaving Cali went to las vegas, that flight was fine. During the second flight to STL, I had above average discomfort in my right ear once we reached 10k ft+. The pain was annoying, but bearable. Once we started descending, the pain immediately surpassed any pain i've ever felt before. I've broken bones before... I've broken my leg, fingers, toes, and my wrist... that pain was nothing compared to this. Nothing I did soothed the pain, I downed 800MG ibuprofen, it had no effect. I chewed gum, I massaged my neck/jaw, my girlfriend massaged my neck/back did everything she knew soothed me, I tried to eat food, nothing worked. For some reason, even thinking about that pain is increasing the level of pain i'm still feeling right now (i'll get to that later). The pain was enough to where I tried to bite my tongue to avert my mind from the pain in my ears and jaw. When we landed, I burst into tears because I had hoped and hoped that it would stop... and it didn't. The pain persisted for the rest of that night until I took some pharmaceuticals and drugged myself to sleep.When I woke up, the pain was the normal discomfort I feel on an airplane. It has now been more than 35 hours since I landed, and the discomfort is still here. If I burp a certain way, or yawn to hard the pain intensifies to what it was during descent. I have no idea what to do or how to prevent this from ever happening again.But, this has happened before. Last summer, I went to New Mexico to work at Philmont high adventure base as a trail guide (Ranger). Towards the end of my stay there, I became sick with a runny nose and sore throat. Because I was sick, I was forced to stay in base and not trek up into the mountains. After 2 -3 days of being sick in base... I was woken up in the middle of the night by the same type of pain described above (the pain during descent). But it was not as severe as the pain on the plane. I went to the ER in New Mexico, and they looked in my ear and saw nothing out of the ordinary. The pain was intense enough I could not sit still let alone sleep, so they prescribed 800MG ibuprofen (all they had at the time). The pain was rough, but it did not put me into tears like on the plane. The next day, the ER contacted the closest hospital and they sent over a decongestant nasal spray and prescribed it to me to take before every meal and once before and after sleep.The spray did nothing, and I was forced to simply deal with the ""normal airplane discomfort"" that followed the days afterwards. Because of the late night incident, the doctor advised me to not go into the mountains (elevation change)... I waited 5 days religiously following my prescription, and I could wait no longer. I went with a friend into the mountains and once I reached an elevation change of 2000 feet my ears popped and the pressure, the ringing, the pain.... everything was gone.. Everything was fine after that. But now, I'm in Missouri.... there are no mountains for me climb. What do I do?****The symptoms I'm currently feeling****Sudden pain in the ears, it intensifies and then dulls without warning.A constant loud ringing, I am currently hard of hearing.Sometimes, I can feel the fluid behind my ear drums move when I tilt my head at an angle. I currently cannot do that, but it was happening yesterday (off the plane).Severe short bursts of pain when I burp a certain way, or finish a yawn.Pressure in my ears (the pressure changes and switches location throughout the day. The pressure can be anywhere from a grape in my ear canal up to what feels like an orange, lol)***Things I've tried***A heat bag, so far this is the only thing that ""helps"". I use quotes on helps, because I can't tell if it lessons the pain or simply makes me comfortable enough to push out the pain and think of other things.Decongestants (They help my nose, but not my ears)large doses of ibuprofen (does nothing)Tylenol (does nothing)Percoset (Helped me ignore the pain and sleep)A hot steamy shower (did nothing but cleanse my pores)Trying to pop my ears by gently blowing against a held nose (did nothing)Yawning (did nothing)Chewing gum (nothing)I had my ears examined, and again they look fine."

"Otitis Media","I am 34 and have had problems with my ears since my mid teens until mid twentees, basically glue ear which resulted in hearing loss to the extent I wear an aid in my right ear.Over the last three months my right ear has been uncomfortable to different degrees, never very painful, but a combination of discomfort, itching and a warm feeling. The first time I went to the Dr I was given oral anti biotics, this calmed it down a little and when I went back in mid November they would not give me any more antibiotics despite it still looking red and inflamed and I was told it will recover on its own. I have since been back three times with my ear feeling uncomfortable and with more hearing loss (I hope this is not permanent) to be told it is looking red in the ear but it is viral!!! How long can viral infections last it started in October!!!The discomfort varies, but over the last few days it is peaking aging with the ear canal and the skull around the ear feeling warm and sore!"

"Otitis Media","Hello,basically, about a week ago I think I caught a cold, it started with a sore throat & sort of fever/bad stomach one night, and then I got a flight (my ears popped a lot during this flight, though not unsual for me in such instances), and then I got the mucus and coughing. One night, maybe 6 days ago, I felt a tickle in my ear just before going to bed so I decided to clean my ear using a cotton bud (as I usually would do when I get a tickle), and it seemed fine when I got into bed, but then I started getting a pain. I fell asleep and woke up in the middle of the night with a very painful sharp pain in my ear. It was awful. I have never had problems with my ears before. I took a pain killer and mananged to fall asleep. The next morning it was not as painful but it felt like there was a marble or something rolling around in my ear, and if I remember correctly a bit of a crackling sound. It felt more painful/uncomfortable/noisy when I tilted my head in certain positions. My bfs mother said it could be that when I used the cotton buds in my ear, I pushed the thing that was tickling inside, further down to my ear drum. A day or so later, she put 2 drops of this stuff ""Ciflox"" I think it is called, into my ear, she said it would eat whatever it was that was irritating it. I was not sure about using it but she reassured me and so I trusted her. It stopped the feeling that something was moving around in my ear and the crackling, and my ear then only felt blocked and I couldn't hear very well out of it. Then 2 days later she put 2 more drops in my ear, and this morning (next day) we tried to wash out my ear with warm water, but not sure we suceeded. My ear still feels blocked and I can't hear very well out of it. I am afraid I have damaged my ear somehow. Also sometimes when I move my jaw in a certain way, I feel a little crackling sound inside it still. I still also have mucus and the same side of my throat as the ear (left side) has been the most sore side during this cold.I should also mention that I suffer a bit from TMJ, especially in the evenings when I am tired, my jaw gets very tight sometimes and it is mostly from the left side again. I am used to also getting this crackling sound/feeling on the left side of my jaw when I open my mouth too wide/yawn or similar.Any ideas on what has happened to my ear? I am getting anxious and will perhaps go to the doctor if it my ear still feels this way tomorrow, but I don't want to just take any old ear drops or tablets unless I have to. I am worried I shouldn't have taken the Ciflox either "
"Otitis Media","This morning I was on my phone, looking down and then I felt vertigo come on that then turned into Im going to pass out?I was full blown faint. So i freaked out and went to the doctors (I didnt pass out btw)The doctor said hes seen 3 people in the past 2 days that have had the same case and said theres a virus going around thats causing this.He gave me the diagnosis of viral labyrinthitis that he believes because of my cold I recently had that it finally found its way into my inner ear (and also possible is benign positional vertigo)He also obviously looked in my ears and said they looked great which I give credit to the Nasacort for helping a girl out with that, but I really dont know how I feel about my diagnosis. Obviously there wasnt much he could do for me except prescribe me anti very which I already have 25 pills left.Still going to see the ENT next week so I guess well see if they can think of anything or if I need an MRI (which freaks me out) although he did say that it was less likely to be a brain issue, but Im terrified. I hope to god I dont get that Im going to pass out?feeling again because that was the scariest moment ever."

"Otitis Media","I noticed when Im talking as of recently that my right ear (the one the doctor said looked dull and had fluid behind it) will make a pop sound. I read in a lot of forums that it might be a sign of ETD? Any truth to it and anybody else have the same?"
"Otitis Media","Ok so this is going to be a relatively long post so thank you in advance to anyone who reads this and can offer some advice.A couple of months ago I started to feel like I was coming down with something, this only lasted a couple of days and never really manifested into anything. A week or so later after a heavy night of drinking I woke up feeling very strange. I just put it down to being extremely hungover so decided to go for a walk to the shop. On my way back I felt odd as I was crossing the road, almost as though I wasn't in my body, then followed a sudden urge to be sick and then I experienced this awful dizzy/light headed sensation and it felt like the ground was moving with every step I took. I instantly panicked as I didn't have a clue what was happening to me as had never felt this way before. I managed to get home safely and when I did I dragged myself to bed. Whilst laying in bed things got worse. It felt like I was rocking as I lay still and every time I tried to close my eyes it felt like everything was moving. I honestly thought I was dying and felt weird in my own body. I managed to get a couple of hours sleep and woke up feeling a little bit better..until I got up and moved about. My head felt too heavy for my shoulders and like there was this pressure inside it, no pain just a very heavy feeling and I felt very unstable on my feet. I went to bed putting it down to being a nasty hangover and prayed I would feel like my normal self in the morning.When I woke up, the vertigo sensation has disappeared but the heavy head remained and my whole body felt heavy. 2 months later and I'm battling this every day. Some days are better than others but I'm having anxiety attacks daily due to this feeling. Throughout this time I've had a lot of symptoms which are:- Heaviness in head- Muffled hearing- Vertigo - not so much spinning but a rocking sensation. Is worse if I'm standing on a sloped bit of ground or in a car in stop start traffic- Sensitive to loud noises- Tired, heavy eyes and unfocused vision- Sinus pain round eyes, forehead, nose and cheeks- Occasional ear pain- Everything feels blocked in face and ears- Post nasal drip- Nausea and mild stomach aches- Drunk/drugged up feeling, worse when outside and in busy places such as supermarkets, shopping centres- Floaty feeling when I walk- Ground sometimes feels like it's moving, this is especially bad if I'm standing outside at night- Achy legs which I don't know if caused by constant worrying and laying in bed a lot- Faint and dizzy- Pressure in face, worse if I tip my head forwards and come back up- Frequent waking in the night- Get very tired very easily- Hot sensation in head if I've overdone it- A feeling of being disconnected from my body and from the world, everything looks a bit different and unfocused- Tinnitus daily, not constant but happens at least twice a dayThe last week everything started to get worse and I seriously thought I may have been dying. I decided to make a doctors appointment for the fifth time and saw a different doctor than my usual. May I add - I've had severe ear wax build up and got them syringed last weekend which resulted in me feeling dizzier than ever so thought now my ears are clear it may be easier for a doctor to look inside. Anyway, this new doctor I saw thoroughly checked me over. He checked my bp which was lower than usual so got me to stand up and he checked it again to which he said nothing dangerous and he isn't worried (I panicked because I felt very faint at the time), he checked my ears and my throat and said I had bad post nasal drip. He then prescribed me with antibiotics and anti vertigo tablets and said I had a combination of sinusitis and labyrinthitis. I walked away feeling very happy that I finally had a diagnosis but still worrying as to why my symptoms have been worse in the past week, may I add I've recently quit smoking and have come off of anti-depressants so don't know if they're making me feel dizzier. I have also been suffering with cold like symptoms over the last week which I believe were from quitting smoking.I'm totally at a loss because if these symptoms don't get better with antibiotics then I will be really upset. This has ruined my life for 2 months! I can't go out as the symptoms worsen, I lost my job because I had to keep going home due to feeling odd. I turn 26 tomorrow and feel I'm going to be spending my birthday laying in bed, praying I don't faint and that the bed 'stops moving'!Can anybody offer some advice on how I can control this and please offer some reassurance that I'm not going to drop down dead. This has caused me to become a hypochondriac where I'm convincing myself it's the worst and the doctors got it wrong.Also - I've been on the meds since Tuesday and the Betahistine for my veritgo is making it worse! Antibiotics feel like they're clearing everything!"
"Otitis Media","Hey, Im back. I just cant get this off my mind. Ive slept for the past 2 days because Im so sad and I feel like Im going insane. I got an appointment for next Thursday with an ENT and that also freaks me out because Im terrified of doctors.I wanted to share my symptoms again and maybe hear from others that have these things wrong with them and maybe tell me what they think, if our symptoms link up.My symptoms:?Buzzing/Rumbling Tinnitus?My Tinnitus is also not 24/7 its here and there?Vertigo attacks for a couple seconds (and I never notice a change or increase with my Tinnitus when attacks happen)?Imbalanced, on a boat?feeling most of the time?Feeling like hearing in my right ear is muffled (been like that for awhile so Im used to it at this point)?Crackling/Popping sounds everytime I swallow or yawn (in both ears usually)?Doctor said my eardrum looked dull?Nasacort did help when doctor prescribed me it?Was better for awhile, but recently got a cold and all hell broke looseIll keep you guys updated on what the doctors say next Thursday. Hope to god its nothing too crazy. Im freaking out."
"Otitis Media","Ive been on and off dizzy since September. It started with feeling like I was swaying on a boat 24/7 and then vertigo attacks came into play (not lasting very long at all). Of course I got worried so I went to the doctors (not an ENT) and he told me my eardrum was dull and I had fluid behind my eardrum, then he prescribed me Nasacort and I was on my way. That diagnosis of fluid behind my eardrum?made complete sense because I had been having tinnitus for MONTHS, not knowing it even was tinnitus. Any time I do the slightest bit of exercise my right ear becomes plugged up like I have a ear plug and I have to sniff really hard, yawn and swallow multiple times to get it to unplug. Ive honestly just had consistent problems with my right ear for quite some years, and have even woken up a couple times with vertigo that usually went away by the end of the day. The Nasacort really helped. I stopped having vertigo attacks and the dizziness was at bay. I felt so relieved! I stopped taking it after awhile and Ive been okay since. A little of that on a boat?feeling here and there, but nothing that was as crazy as that first week. Recently, I got a cold! I was stuffed up so badly and miserable. I was taking a nasal decongestant spray every 12 hours like recommended and it really helped, but once the 3rd or 4th day (December 13th) of my cold hit...the dizziness came back with revenge. Ever since then its been exactly like how it was the first week back in September.Tonight got bad so I decided to start taking Nasacort again to get some relief, even after 1 use tonight I felt better, but Im still scheduling an appointment for an ENT. Im pretty nervous because I do have major health anxiety along with anxiety in general. I was wondering if anyone else had a similar experience like this and what the ENT diagnosed you with? Also, what did they all do at the appointment to get to that diagnosis? just to maybe better prepare me for what Im going intoSide note:I feel like I have ETD from swollen tonsils and possibly swollen adenoids. I got strep throat at least once a year for my whole school career (Im 20 now) and I did get mono back in 2013. So, from consistent strep throats and mono my tonsils are fairly enlarged to this day and I read that ETD can be caused by that."

"Otitis Media","I had a soar throat after Thanksgiving so I took two to three ibuprofen a day bc they helped them I noticed a ringing in my left ear followed with it burning and my ear turns red and hurt. Im so scared Im gonna go deaf or have to live with this ringing. At times its not that bad but with loud noises almost brings me to my knees. I went to the Doctors and she looked in my ears and then prescribed meclizine, Claritin, and flonex. I took the meclizine and bc I have methemoglobinemia that I was born with I had a bad reaction to it the first dose and didnt take anymore. The meclizine also caused everything to look so bright but idk if that has anything to do with the ringing or not. I have taken the Claritin for four days now and nothing has really changed. I also have ptsd and panic and anxiety attacks and this makes those worse. Im a mess yall Idk I cant take a lot of stuff bc Im allergic to a book load of stuff. Thanks"
"Otitis Media","Alright so my ear has been doing this SUPER weird thing lately for maybe a month. If I burp or yawn or sometimes it is just random, it will drum roll?? Thump???

It was getting better the first couple days after I started the medicine, however I was sleeping with a different pillow then? I don't know if that can make a difference but it is definitely something with pressure changes around my ear.

"Otitis Media","Today I woke up with muffled hearing in my left ear that has over the day been randomly making crackling noises. Both issues disappeared/were less noticeable for a few hours after using a cotton bud (which had a fair amount of wax).If it still is the same when I wake up tomorrow, Im wondering what I should do. I shouldnt really have used the cotton bud, and I cant use olive oil (I have a perforated eardrum). I had an ear infection a few months ago and have also had random moments of my ear leaking for no apparent reason (though I noticed it begun a few weeks after a fall).I understand the NHS are pretty cash-strapped so I dont want to waste unnecessary money, but I also just want to know what is causing it, so I thought Id also ask here too."
"Otitis Media","Hi there. I am hoping someone on here maybe able to shed some light as to what is going on?About a month ago i developed very muffled hearing and roaring in my right ear and it also felt like someone was trying to pull my inner out so a trip to the doctors confirmed that i had an ear infection and i was prescribed some ear spray to use twice a day for a week. After this time the pulling sensation had gone was i was still left with the deafness and roaring, another trip to the doctors and was told that sometimes after an ear infection it can cause the ear drum to swell slightly so was given a course of antibiotics. I have just finished the course of them and it doesnt appear to be any better. My symptoms are the following:Very muffled hearing along with roaring, sometimes almost total deafness in my right ear.What i would call a headache in my right eye, which makes me feel sick.Feeling disorientated and in a bubble?and cant hear everything that is going on around me.Feeling short tempered with myself and everyone i come into contact with, just feel like being very rude to them and screaming.Just feeling very much like a female Victor Meldrew , which isnt like me at all!Now a couple of year ago when i had an eye test it was discovered that my right eye has a slight convex shape to the eyeball which means that the vision from that eye is almost like looking through slightly frosted glass but nothing was done about it and was told just to leave it until as and when it became a real issue.Could the two thing be connected or does anyone have any idea what could be going on?Please help..Thank You"
"Otitis Media","Ok, so I went to Greece with my cousin in July, and there both of us developed ear ringing at pretty much the same time. At first it was a hell, couldn't sleep, quite noticeable. Then we went to the doctor and he told us that we have ear infections, gave us anti inflammatory. We took these, and over the next couple of weeks, the ringing gradually declined to where it is barely noticeable, so that's a good thing.However, it's been months, and even though I don't notice anything during the day, I can still hear a very, very low sound when I go to sleep at night. I asked him, and it's the same for him. Other than that, what also happens, is that I sometimes wake up with a quite loud ringing in one ear, which fades after about half an hour - this happens rarely by the way, but it never fails to freak me out.So yeah, pretty confused, haven't been to the doc since Greece, and I'm not too sure what to make of this. Could an infection be lasting this long? Also we have NOT been exposed to loud music or anything like that at all... just haven't been quite the same since that tripBy the way --- I also want to add that when I move my ear muscles around, I hear a crackling sound inside my ears, like when you touch a plastic bag"
"Otitis Media","Hi everyone. Desperate for advice. Just recently got a bad ear infection and my glands r up. Just had nose quartrised from constant bleeds but my right channel in nose is extremely sore and I have black marks underneath my upper lip. Is the ear infection anything to do with my nose problem? Thanku!"
"Otitis Media","Hi so for about 6 months now I've been having a popping sound in my right ear. It doesn't appear to be in sync with my pulse. It only happen when i quickly move my h ead, walk quickly or do do anything that changes my head position quickly. The sound is siniliar to the sound of popping your eara. I also have tinnitus in that ear and some high frequency hearing loss.Hi so for about 6 months now I've been having a popping sound in my right ear. It doesn't appear to be in sync with my pulse.

"Otitis Media","hi all, getting a bit worried. Have had an episode of Myringitis and am on treatment with Gentamicin ear drops. Problem began last Monday but I had a sinus problem before that. I am taking anti biotics now for the sinus issue.Problem is I still can't hear properly in that ear. It is driving me crazy. Off and on still a bit of pain but the hearing issue is the really scary bit of it. I have a droning noise in my ear ....so tinnitus....but very little return of hearing after 5 days of treatment. Anyone else had this type of infection and know what I can expect. Thanks"
"Otitis Media","I'm a 28 year old classical pianist. I have had tinnitus and hyperacusis for about 7 years due to overexposure to loud music. Recently my tinnitus accentuated after minor physical ear trauma. I funneled the same pitch as my tinnitus in to my ear with a sound clip in order to try and break the feedback loop in my ears. It worked, but my left ear that has the hyperacusis vibrated something crazy. At the end of the 30 min session, I felt like I left a rock concert and my hearing not adjust to hearing like normal. For the next month to a month in a half, my hearing went from drastic hyperacusis, everything hurt my ears, to feeling like I was underwater to the complete lack of hyperacusis that I had experienced for years. I was accepting that I killed off the dying hair cells that were causing the hyperacusis in the first place, when I took a trip to Appalachia. I was on the phone while driving up the mountains, and next thing I know, it's like someone turned the volume up. I checked the volume, no change. I realized that the pressure in my ears had dissipated, and I could hear more properly again. I am still not 100 percent where I was before this incident started, but it is much more tolerable now. Could it be that I had that much swelling in my ears from the frequency trauma? I had been taking diphenhydramine daily hoping for signs of swelling with minimal results; though sometimes when I would tilt my head, it was like I could feel the bubbles of a water bottle being turned upside down slowly moving in my head. If I go back down the mountains, will it come back? Should I stay a couple of weeks? What's the deal here? Thank you for taking the time to read this, and thank you for any advice you might have. I'll never take quality hearing for granted again. I couldn't hear the gravel under my feet at the height of this incident. "

"Otitis Media","Back in July, I had a terrible cold, and as a result, have had a swollen eustacian tube and fluid in my one ear ever since.

"Otitis Media","Sooo this has happened over the last 10 monthsSo I've had inflamed sinuses which we can't seem to sort out no infection but nose is Inflamed to the point I can barely breathe. The left is completely closed and the right is less so. I'm not having an allergic reaction as i've had bloods and im IM E is so low like 9.50 when it just needs to be <100. My ears wont pop at all and my eyes feel twitchy.I've had tinnitus for a while which got worse again when I listened to some music. I also have tension in my neck shoulders and all the way down my back that I can't get rid of it's sore and wont shift the tension goes right up into the back of my neck behind my ears.So over time I started losing internal sensation in my body and face which was scary but manageable i've now its spread to my ears and i've started to lose that feeling in and around my ears which is scaring the s*it out of me. I can still hear pretty much perfectly but anywhere busy its difficult to distinguish between sounds properly and sound is quite flat and irritates my ears. The sensation in my inner ear and outer ear then my ear shell went bit by bit over weeks and each time was followed by a change to the way things sound. This happened in both ears simultaneously except once when it happened in the left then the right ear.Noise doesnt resonate through my ears or head properly anymore it's bizzare. Ive had tinnitus for a long time which started when I started getting ill in January. The tinnitus has gone from a ringing to a hiss and is now quieter and higher pitched as I lose the hearing sensation around my ear. it started with right inside my ear going dead then a bit further out and then the outer shell then slowly the areas around the ear which I didnt even realise picked up sound until it went dead. At the moment my T is now hissing is very high pitched and distant. I hate using headphones now because music sounds so flat and strange. Loud noises irritate me too even my own voice is a bit much sometimes.Anyone have any clue what could be causing this or if i'm just going to lose my hearing one day when the last bit gets snuffed out?I'm waiting on an ENT referral as the NHS is over subscribed i'm going to be waiting until after christmas it took me months to get a GP referral as they would rather shove nasal sprays at me.Thanks in advance for any advice / help"
"Otitis Media","Hi, I had some allergy issues about a month ago. Started on Flonase and allergy seemed to clear up, but I noticed what I thought was a swollen lymph node afterwards and my left ear (same side as lymph node) felt clogged up. Waited two weeks, went to doctor and we tried prednisone (ear felt slightly better but node did not change), and then antibiotics. No change. Feeling some pain (not intense...but just slight pain) on left side of neck where swollen node was. Went to ENT and was told that it is not a lymph node that is swollen, but rather inflammation on the outside of my carotid artery. He called this carotidynia. I have also, in the past week, been experiencing some slight vertigo issues. The first time it happened I went to ER thinking it was related to the carotidynia, but CT Scans, EKG etc were all fine. So, my question. Can this little bump on my neck (the inflamed carotid) cause my ear to feel plugged up? And,maybe that caused my vertigo? Has anyone else heard of this? If I hold my neck just right,I can see the bump and see my pulse in there. So strange! Let me know if anyone else has experienced this and if maybe my ear/vertigo symptoms are related to the carotidynia. Thank you"
"Otitis Media","Hey guys! Since the last october i have had some problems with my left ear. The problem started when i used a waterballon, to rinse the ear of earwax. But when i used the waterballon with water, i added WAY to much water in my ear, I mean alot. And the first week i couldt hear on that ear, but it got better with the weeks, although the ""water-feeling"" in my left ear was still there. Weeks after i got a earinfection, because of all the water that was in my ear.Anyways. Now, so long time after, I can still feel the water, if its the water I feel. For example, when the sounds is very high, when i'am screaming etc, then i can feel a ""boop-water-feeling"", hard to describe. It lasts 1-2 seconds, just when i am screaming/high sounds.I have also rinsed my ear for earwax, but the thing is still there, and its a bit annoying.Does anobdy know what it could be? Is it some water still left, or something other?"
"Otitis Media","Hi. I am new to this. I live in Canada. June 2014, a year ago, when my ear started popping out of the blue. It was my left ear only. I saw my GP who suggested allergy medication and nasal spray. I tried both and it did not work. I had 2 more nasal sprays and again, did not work. I went back to my GP and referred me to an ENT. I had to wait 5 months ... Month 5, I was still suffering from ear popping and my hearing started to seem muffled and lots of ear pressure and fullness in both ears. I saw an ENT who had nothing to say or helped at all. He said I have ETD and good luck. Only suggested an ear popper device. I bought an ear popper which costed me almost $200. It works ... but only for a few minutes because my ears will feel pressure and full again. It is like I have to use this device 24/7. Month 12, It is now June 2015 .. I am still suffering. I had a hearing test done 4 months ago and found out that I lost 10d in my left ear. I wanted to cry. Why? Because I am already hearing impaired. I wear hearing aids in both ears. I now have anxiety and will probably have a breakdown soon because no one will help me. Two weeks ago, I am hearing humming in my right ear. It is very upsetting and annoying. It won't go away either. The popping in my left ear only happens when I am laying down, sleeping. It goes away when I get up. All day, everyday, I have fullness, pressure in both ears and now I have a humming nose in my right ear. I went back to my GP who referred me to a second ENT. I have no idea how long I will be waiting .... I am only 24 years old, female. I have no idea what to do anymore. I also have acid reflux my whole life. I don't know what is going on"

"Otitis Media","Good morning all,I wanted to ask some advice regarding my ear. Im really frustrated.I have been popping my ears all my life - I.e. manually doing it and never really had a problem. Its a bad habit, I guess.About two weeks ago I noticed my left ear wouldnt pop fully and felt like there was pressure still in my ear. Since that point I have been popping my ears constantly but have now found that they will pop, but left ear has liquid in it as there is a bubbling sound and hearing is muffled.Ive done some research online and it points toward the fact that it could be ETD. I have tried sudafed and it helps a little. Have not yet been to the doctor. There is no real pain - its just really frustrating.I have become highly anxious as Ive read that this from other posts that this could go on for months to years...Do you think my popping continuously essentially made the problem worse? Any advice you could give?Thanks.G"
"Otitis Media","First of all, If you have had ear problems your whole life and have had your eardrum perferated several times with drainage that has a foul oder and is a yellowish discharge, this is an ear infection. If you continually have ear infections your whole life and go to an ENT, they will not know how to treat you know a days. The ENTs are not taught as the older ENTs have been. The older ones recognize an ear disease where now the ENTs just consider the infection. The problem with this is that repeated infections eat away the mastoid bone also called the tempral lobe. The ENT will not hesitate to take out some of the mastoid calling it a mastoidectomy. the problem is that now they use a drimmil type tool to remove the mastoid bone which looks like a honey comb. they can easily take out too much of this and cause your skull to collapse and your brain can fall into the hole causing so many other problems and is disabling. Do not be fooled like I was and just think its just an ear infection.,,while that is infected, its eating away the bones inside of your ears. After many years of this it becomes deadly. I will never again go to an ENT. I go to a neurotologist. these are very hard to find and are worth every mile you have to drive to see one. I go 400 miles on a round trip to see mine. I am now disabled from an ENT doing my surgery. I cannot drive anymore, no more shopping due to florescent lighting giving me seizures. I see so many going thru some of the stuff that I went thru.Clogged ears after an infection is called glue ear. this has to be perferated and suctioned out. No, it dont feel good but once that junk is out of there you will be able to hear. what has happened is that your eustation tube has been clogged with this thick gelled mucus stuff. It has to come out or you wont be able to hear. I have had this done about 4 times now. I do have an ear disease and its called Chronic Middle Ear Disease. I should have been pronounced disabled since I was a child. Some now call it Inner Ear Disease which is the same thing. They are Autoimmune. Nothing really causes it, its the body attacking that area. I have been out hundreds of thousands of dollars on my ears. I have had 2 stapes implants, 2 nose jobs, the first one was a flop, 4 ear surgeries reconstructing the ear drum and implants, the last ear surgery was done by a neurotologist and a neurosurgeon. the neurotologist took out the implant that was useless and never was stable and made me the whole stapes, stirup, and long bone in my ear. I still am having fluid which he said was normal and when it clears up at times, I hear GREAT. the fluid is now coming and going but I am still healing. I will post pics of this last surgery. be aware , its not for the faint of heart. My incision came back open and it had to heal from the inside out. I had my last surgery back in feb. of this year. As you will be able to see is that I have been cut from the temple down to behind the ear and ear wall down for them to fix what had happened to me. I had to have a neurosurgeon also because my tempral bone/mastoid had collapsed due to the previous surgery by an ENT. I know i keep posting for you all to go to a NEUROTOLOGIST but they have saved my life. I never thought an ear infection could be deadly.With the pictures below, the first one was taken in june of 2012. The second one was taken 2 yrs later trying to find out what was wrong with me. the third one is where my ear came back open after surgery. the next one is right after surgery. The last one is where you can see the cut from my temple down behind my ear and my ear cannal was cut into also. there is a big difference in the appearance from june 2012 to dec. 2014. MY POINT IS, EAR INFECTIONS CAN BE DEADLY. Do not underestimate what an ear infection is doing to your head."

"Otitis Media","Hello everyone. I have been suffering with ear problems for about two years now. This might be long, so bare with me. I have had a severe skin issue all my life, so my new doctor decided I should try this medication that almost killed me years ago (I know great doctor!) So I got ill for two days on it. I came off of it and noticed my ears started itching like crazy. I got thrush in the left ear, and the right ear was puss filled. I then had re occurring ear infections (the left ear specifically) My right ear is OK. I then noticed I had really bad tinnitus, like a drowning, ringing noise. So over the course of two years I get put on various sprays, drops, oils. I have two hearing tests which come back fine, my hearing is amazing. I already knew that though! I saw two ENT specialists who basically wouldn't really listen to me at all. I had a scope done twice, they couldn't see anything, said my ears and nose were fine. I feel like I'm loosing my mind, I know something is wrong with me, yet these doctors cant find out whats wrong. Some seem like they cant be bothered. My own GP is very nice and encourages me to look stuff up online. He couldn't really think what was wrong with me, except maybe anxiety. Just so you know I work in therapy, meditation, so I'm a very chill person these days. It's NOT anxiety. I know there is something going on because the symptoms keep getting worse! So what are the symptoms? Well it started off with ear infections, then they went away, and I was left with tinnitus. The tinnitus actually cleared up slightly, but then out of nowhere I started getting stabbings pains in my left ear, sort of like a toothache, but in my ear. I also have a ""fullness"" feeling, like I can hear fine, but it feels weird, maybe not as open as the other ear. When I hold my nose that ear doesn't pop, the other does though. When I do anything strenuous it feels like pressure builds up in that ear, and I feel all dizzy. Then over the past five months maybe, I started getting this heightened sound. Like everyone talking, noises made, drive me mad. I cover my ear as its too loud. The tinnitus has gotten louder again now too. So I'm trying to get a doctor appointment again. He refuses to give me any sort of scans because of Radiation, but I want to know what's wrong with me. I had some ideas about what It could be, likeeustachian tube dysfunction (at first) , but now maybeHyperacusis (the heightened sound..). Whatever it is, they can't visually see it.Hello everyone.

"Otitis Media","5 days ago (Saturday) my pain started as mild earache which I managed with ibuprofen. By Sunday evening I was in excruciating pain radiating up my head and down my jaw. I felt like I was being smashed in the side of the head with a hammer while a wasp repeatedly stung me inside the ear, all in time with my heart beat. By Monday morning a large lump had appeared under my ear and swelling behind and below it. I saw my GP who diagnosed Otitis Externa - due to swelling and debris she could not see my ear drum, my temp was 38.5. I was prescribed Sofradex ear drops. There has been no improvement and last night the pain became truly unbearable- I am unable to lay down as this makes the throbbing worse, I cannot clench my teeth or chew, sleeping is impossible. I called the surgery again this morning (day 3 of antibiotics), this time they had a nurse ring back. I explained the problem and how much pain I'm in. Without seeing me, she prescribed codeine and Amoxiclav with instruction to continue with ear drops, ibuprofen and paracetamol. I've been taking these all day today and am getting no pain relief. Nothing is helping, it's now end of day 5 of earache, and day 3 of antibiotics. Surely something should be improving by now, should I really be feeling worse!? "

"Otitis Media","Hello, I'm really hoping that someone can help here, I've had an ear infection since Wednesday evening, I went to the doctors on Thursday morning in pain and was given otomise ear drops and told to take paracetamol and ibuprofen - I have asthma. I went back the next day in more pain and was turned away and told to carry on with my prescribed spray, by 13:00 in the morning I was in tears and went to the out of hours surgery to be told what I had been prescribed wouldn't touch the infection because my ear is swollen shut and the meds were too weak, I was given cocodamol 500mg which helps half the pain and antibiotics that I've been taking for two days with little to no improvement - fluxolaxin (I think). When the cocodamol wears off I'm in tears again with the throbbing/ stabbing pain - I've started getting clear discharge out of my ear today and my face is slightly swollen. I don't know if I should go back to the docs or a&e, or if I should grin and bare the pain and wait? Please help x Jade"
"Otitis Media","So last Monday I went to an NHS walk-in with chronic ear pain, I put it down to the skydive that I had done 2 days before. Doc suggested that it could be Eustachian tube dysfunction, which there is no treatment for. Gradually got worse, saw another doctor on Thursday as the pain had gotten worse and I could hardly hear. He then prescribed me with antibiotics suggesting it could be an ear infection as there was a build up of fluid in my right ear which was causing the ear drum to burst, he said it also looked like a small hole in my ear drum was scabbing over. 4 days after being on antibiotics and my pain isnt better and Im just as deaf as what I was before, should I see another doctor or am I overreacting??"

"Otitis Media","My right ear out of nowhere had gotten plugged. I have seen 2 ENT doctors who gave me a nasal steroid spray, sinus rinse and neither have worked at 14 weeks.

"Otitis Media","Around 2 weeks ago, I woke up feeling a bit dazed with this ringing in my left ear, the symptoms persisted and my ear felt blocked also. I went to the walk in centre and was told there is No infection, no wax or problems with the ear drum. I then went to my GP who confirmed this and has referred me to an ear specialist. This problem is driving me crazy, has anyone experienced anything similar?"

"Otitis Media","I've had an extremely painful ear for 5 days. Basically I started feeling pain a week ago. The first day was fine and I could cope. The second day was when things became so sore in such a short space of time. I made an emergency appointment with a doctor and he looked in my ear canal, and all he could see was pus and wax. So he gave me anti biotics. I took them as advised 3 times a day, but to no avail. The pain in unbelievable. My condition only got worse over time. The pain was like a hammer hitting my ear, and then sudden sharp pains as if a knife was scraping the inside of my ear sometimes. I'm relatively tough and can take pain, but this was just too much pain for me to keep on working. So I left work early yesterday. and phoned in sick today. Bear in mind I get no sick pay. Not only am I worried that I wont get money, but my condition is worsening day by day. My ear is all swollen up, and it feels like its on fire. Its also as if there is another heart beating in my ear, and every time it beats, pain is excruciating. Sometimes it feels like someone shoving metal objects in my ear and its so unbearable. I will have to take another day off work tomorrow. that'll be 24 hours of work in the week sacrificed. I also can't play football or do anything physical as its just too much pain for me to take.

"Otitis Media","So I've had a perforated ear for multiple years now after having constant ear infections at two points in my life that meant I had to have two grommets (these were at least 7 years apart).Recently I've been noticing I struggle to hear things like someone talking so I've turned up stuff to hear better (not thinking it was just me) and I didn't really 'notice' I was doing so until a family member told me to turn down what I was watching, and that it was loud and basically they (the family member) ended up checking my ears and apparently the one with the perforation is especially blocked and the other one is blocked but not as much.Now apparently the doctors will no longer syringe wax out, and obviously I cannot put olive oil in my bad ear (did once though, and was in pain and it did nothing). Apparently you have to get it done at the hospital now (the same family member recently had the same thing happen to them, though in their case it was actual hearing loss not really wax).I have been already referred to ENT back in 2012 and I have yearly appointments with them and my next one isn't until April next year.What should I do?:1) Do I go to the doctor just so I can get another referral so they can clean out my ears?2) Do I call up the hospital and request a nearer appointment? (as they said to call up if I had any problems with my ears, which I have had last month, see other post)3) Do I just try and ignore it? I do have a bit of earache but this is normal even when my ear isn't blocked4) Do I try home remedies such as olive oil again?"

"Otitis Media","I recently went to a Justin Bieber concert. It was awesome and fun except for the fact that it was unbelieveably loud! The screaming girls were the worst part! After the concert, as I was leaving, I felt like I lost 1/3 of my hearing. On the ride home, most of my hearing seemed to come back. I was very exhausted and I figured that my ears would be fully back to normal when I woke up the next morning. But...that didn't happen. When I woke up the morning after the concert, both of my ears hurt bad. My right ear hurt more (probably because that ear was closer to the speakers and this girl kept screaming in that ear!) Anyway, I told my mom I was worried and she said it will go away in a few days and that I shouldn't worry. Two days later, my ears are still no better. I have most of my normal hearing, except it just kinda feels like I lost like 2% of my hearing, if that makes any sense. My ears POP! everytime I swallow or something and my right ear hurts like ear-infection bad!! My ears also kinda feel clogged. (please note, I never had any ringing in my ears after the concert or anything) Is this normal after a big, loud concert? Will this go away and how long might it take to go away? I'm only 13 years old and I have a full life ahead of me! I don't want to have permanent hearing loss because I wanted to go to a Justin Bieber concert when I was 13 and didn't know any better to bring earplugs to my FIRST CONCERT!!! I'm so worried!! My mom made an appointment with my primary care doctor. But in the meantime, what can I do?! I'm so scared. There were hundereds of people way closer to the speakers than me and they seemed fine?! I'm scared...I need some reassurance and support. CAN ONE, FIRST CONCERT CAUSE PERMANENT EAR PAIN AND HEARING LOSS?!?!?! That makes no sense, even if someone has sensitive ears, like me....please help...I can't calm down!! "

"Otitis Media","Hey everyone, first post here. Hope it's the right place. So Yesterday I attended an appointed with a practice nurse for my ears to be syringed. Before this I wasn't experiencing any hearing problems, but my GP reccomended I get my ears syringed because they were waxy. This was after explaining to him I've had tinnitus for aslong as I can remember. So the nurse starts pummeling my ears with the water, and it totally clogs up my right ear, I couldn't hear a thing. I told her, but she says she'd come back to it after the left. Well the exact same thing happened to my left ear, totally clogged up. So I left, feeling horrible, full of regret, and really anxious. I'm a musician and I produce music, I was looking forward to coming home with lovely clean ears and great hearing to make some more music. Nope, not happening. So I put olive oil in my right ear and take a shower. After the shower it's unclogged, but the hearing isn't perfect, it's probably as good as it was before hand. By this point my left ear was a little bit better. I put some oil in it before I went to sleep and when I woke up I couldn't hear properly out of it again. Frustrated, I make my own ear syringe. I know I probably shouldn't but when the nurse done it it caused me great discomfort and pain. I got some success, I managed to remove a relatively large chunk of wax, but my hearing still isn't really back. It feel like there is a pressure deep in my ear.

It been a week.My question is this: Ever since the procedure I have diminished hearing, muffled sounds, feel like I am underwater..with an echo sound when I talk.Constant feeling of pressure that I never had before. This is horrible. All I want to know is will my hearing return to what I am used to hearing and how long it will take, can I do anything to stop the pressure and stuffy feeling in my head.

"Otitis Media","I originally posted on the thread Sudden Ringing in my left ear along with a slight full feeling and pitch change?by James Foley but my issue has some significant differences so I have started to new thread for people experience this exact issue. I would love to hear from anyone who has experienced the same thing.Im 36 and from Hampshire in the UK, on the 16th of May 2016, suddenly out of the blue my left ear went bunged up/pressure/feeling full and started to ring. It felt a bit like suddenly being deep under water but only in the left ear. There was initially also some distortion of certain sounds (high frequencies I think) but that has gone way now. I went to the doctors on Saturday (21st of May 2016). I had a lot of wax at the time in that ear and she said I had to get it out before she could say what it was. I have since had it syringed and the ringing is still going on though it might be a shade quieter than it was to start with. I saw an ENT expert, (on the 13th of July 2016) and he could provide no explanation to what it was, but arranged for me to have a hearing test. When I pushed him for answers, he said what I described was consistent with sudden reduction/loss of hearing. I doubted this very much as I had not noticed any reduction in hearing. I had the hearing test at Andover hospital on 15th of September 2016 and the results were normal in both ears and both ears the same. The ENT did not get back to me after the hearing test so I had to make another appointment myself :-( and my next appointment is this Wednesday (23rd of November 2016).The ENT and every other doctor I have seen say that I havent got an ear infection so that rules that out. The pitch and volume of my ringing changes every now and then. This ear is also often itchy in the earhole but not always and sometimes crackles too. This is a total nightmare! Has anybody else experienced this and had a diagnosis?"

"Otitis Media","For the past year or so Ive had a problem with my right ear popping when I sing, blow my nose, or yawn. It is especially a problem when I sing as it is very distracting and tends to stay popped?for as long as I am singing, making everything I sing sound pretty obnoxious. The problem started after I had a cold about a year ago. Once in a while I will feel an extremely slight pain from the ear. I have seen an ENT who prescribed me two different pills to take over the course of a few weeks (I forget the names of them) and Fluticasone spray. None of this had any effect. I went back to my ENT and he prescribed me Oxymetazoline nasal mist and a Methylprednisolone dose pack, neither of which I have filled the prescription for yet. My ENT said he didnt see any fluid in my ear when he looked in it. If I perform the Valsalva maneuver, my right ear pops very easily and my left ear takes a bit more pressure to pop. Is it possible this problem is just from a buildup of earwax? I am wondering if I should try the new prescriptions I was given or if there are any other suggestions you guys might have as to what is going on here or what I should do. Really looking forward to getting this problem solved mainly so I can sing again without my ear popping all the time. Thanks."
"Otitis Media","Okay, so I'm not sure if it's related but I'm going to start way back in like late Jan/Feburary where I suffered from a bad ear infection. I didn't know it was an ear infection at the time and neither did the urgentcare I went to. She just gave me a z-pack and I generally felt a lot better.  I was completely unaware and didn't feel that I was apparently still draining so heavily from my ear/s that my left lung became unable to fully expand making it feel like I cracked a rib or something. I went to another urgentcare that morning and was given a z-pack, which instantly made things better and the doctor told me I had an ear infection and explained the draining and my lungs and stuff. She mentioned if the draining didn't stop i'd have to have my ears drained or something. Throughout this whole thing I've had no fever. No sore throat. No coughing. No headaches. No runny nose. but there HAS been this constant build up of phlegm or some kind of mucus in my throat. Every swallow is horrible and on my mind and I can't remember the last time I didn't have to think about NOT wanting to swallow my spit. I should also mention I did experience very low energy and I was very lethargic. Not like myself at all.  So then I went to my primary doctor... twice. I was given the two biggest, baddest antibiotics of all and some flonase. No avail. I am fed up at this point and decide to see an ENT. So i go to the ENT last wednesday. He listens to me breathe, looks around my face holes, and then quickly prescribes me sudafed 30mg, bactrim ds 800-160, flonase, and tells me to pick up a saline spray. I also got a steroid shot and immediately after I could, for the first time, swallow perfectly. It was effortless. It was amazing. It was temporary.  But...religiously since then, every morning I take my pills and do the saline, flonase, then saline again. Then I do the same thing at night. Sometimes saline in the middle of the day. This is where it gets kinda gross...  Immediately after I do my saline spray, I get all this build up in my throat thats light green/yellow with darker green and white specs that I gag/cough up and usually once or twice a session theres a massive glob of some very dark green ball with little specks of green/white around it.  After I cough all that up for about 5 mins, I have to blow my nose at least twice where a tooonnnnn of clear mucus comes out. Just clear. Haven't noticed spots really.When I do the flonase, I have the exact same reaction except without needing to blow my nose. It all wants to come out of my mouth instead. It's horrible honestly.And right now, I really cannot tell if it's getting better or staying the same. On the bright side, this sudafed has me feeling like my old self again (lol)  Here are some pics of the crazy darker and bigger globs I hawk up. I guess I could also say that once I cough these particular large thingies up my little hawking spree is over for the most part and I go back to the same drainage as before I did my nose sprays.. http://i67.tinypic.com/im013t.jpghttp://i64.tinypic.com/2li9bop.jpg  I just want to know what's wrong with me. I've been told so many things. That it's possible ear drainage still, it could be something stuck in my throat and my body is creating excess mucus, i have a sinus infection, an upper respiratory infection, that its my adenoids, its from acid reflex (never had heartburn before), etc.I just dont understand if it's all possibly related or what.I've never had sinus/allery issues before either.The ENT said if I didn't feel a little better in a week to go back and he'd have to look inside me and stuff which ill do, but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had anything similar because I'm really panicking at this point. Sorry if this is in the wrong group or something."
"Otitis Media","Hello,The right side of my ear is always having intermittent episodes of feeling clogged/plugged and also has a ringing to it. After a while, it goes away on its own then comes back a month or so later. It isn't associated with a cold or flu and I don't feel pain. What could maybe be causing this to happen? Thanks for any info!"
"Otitis Media","HELP! I have posted a few other issues regarding my recovery but her is a big one that I am experiencing right now. Had Stapedectomy 4 days ago and just an hour ago after taking my antibiotic as normal and decided to take an advil as well.... I started to hear my heart beating in my operated left ear! I am so so scared. Please let me know if any of you experienced it during recovery of your stapedectomy surgery.Thank you!"
"Otitis Media","Have had painful swallowing on the right side for about 4 weeks now. This began around the time I had a mouth infection and some earache, but that cleared up. However the painful swallowing has remained. Went to my GP last week and he said it was a inflammation of the Eustachian Tube, prescribed me antibiotics. However the pain is there a week later, seems the same to me. Only when I swallow or if i try to pop my ears, like with the VM, its really bad. I also notice a lot of crackling in that same ear too, feels like suds in my ears when i move my ear muscles Just wondering if others have had similar problems and how long does it take to clear up ??"
"Otitis Media","I went in last night at almost midnight to take a shower I was tired to. As I was getting out I noticed my ears were ringing really bad it lasted almost a min then went away should I be conceded or is it because one I was super tired and it was also caused from the shower. "

"Otitis Media","Im a 31 year old female and for years since I was a teenager I have suffered a wide range of ear issues and symptoms. Most of the time these are bearable and I can cope but when I get a cold like I did a few days ago and have any kind of nasal or throat congestion, my ears get 100x worse.I will try to describe the ear sensations as best I can. All the time when driving down hills I get a build up of pressure in the ear which leads to dulled hearing and some days I am constantly having to clear them and pop them which gives me instant relief. Now here is the weird thing im concerned about. The only successful way I can take away the pressure and pop and clear my ears is to either swallow hard or more commonly, I use my jaws. I sort of wiggle them about one side at a time and it usually always cracks and pops my ear, and im relieved. Is this normal? Ive had to do this for years, and no one I know does it- in fact they havent a clue what im talking about. What am I doing and what is happening when I do this? Now as I said this method usually works perfectly but when ive a cold such as now it doesnt work and i cant clear my ears- and sometimes i actually make the build up of pressure or blockage worse. And this week I am panicking as for past couple of days I cannot clear and pop my left ear using my jaw as normal but the right ear is fine. I am scared there is something seriously and permanenty wrong with my left side because this is the only way I can clear them- why isnt it working? Is this due to my cold? So left ear and my ears in general with the cold feel pressure, blockage clogging, and like they need to pop- and once they do I get relief.I also suffer from ringing and buzzing in the ears but this does not annoy me as much as the awful senstions and feelings when my ears are affected with the cold- my hearing is weird and I either cannot hear very well and things are muffled like u have cotton wool or else weirdly its like my hearing becomes suddenly too sensitive and noises are unbearable and i have to try to pop them again- what is causing this or happening?When I do clear my ears I feel my nostril opening up sometimes too and again sometimes when ive cold, i can hear myself breathing out of that nostril.These ear issues are so unnatural and weird and Ive never met anyone who has the same. I am on decongestants and anti-inflammtorys, anti-histmines, and antibiotics.I am worried sick that my jaw clearing on left side wont come back especially and all of this lead to major depression and suicidal feelings in the past and this week I feel exactly the same- it makes me frustrated, angry and feeling like I dont want to live anymore like this. I cry every day.I have been to doctors who prescribe medication but dont seem to know whats wrong as neither do any ENTs ive been too.Does ANYONE here understand what im talking about or experienced the same and can offer any advice? Please I am desperate. I am single and cannot work or have social life and never had a relationship due to this problem.Thanks in advance."

"Otitis Media","hi, so i had my ear operation a week ago and the pain and pressure was pretty mild, finished my antibiotics(day 5). day 8 i woke up 1am in pain and as more pressure in my ear possibly swelling and it hurt to open my jaw or move my head from side to side.( i say it felt like a wisdom tooth coming threw my ear) i checked my cotton woll and there was alot more blood than days before. yesterday i went to see a doctor where they cleaned my ear and found a normal amount of blood. He put peroxide around the ear, since then it has started feeling better and the pressure has gone down. day 10 i am stil experiencing loud ringing in the ear and it doesnt really seem as my hearing has gotten any better, hoping that the prosthetic bone hasnt dislodged or the swelling didnt hurt me eardrum...- has anybody else experienced similar pain after there stapedectomy operation and how did it go afterwards ?- has anybodies bone become dislodged and what did it feel like ?I am seeing my doctor again tommorow so i will stay posted with what he says."
"Otitis Media","Hello my name is Luis and ive had a terrible ear problem starting about 6 days ago when i was in gym class changing and i was done putting my school clothes but all of the sudden when I was breathing from my nose my right ear would slowly pop as if im in an elevator but if I breath really fast from my nose it would pop my ear at the paste I was breathing. I went to my next class but was messing with my nose a little bit and panicing because I knew it wasnt normal so then I massaged kinda under my ear and I tried breathing from my nose but it went away and i could breath without the annoying pop following my breathing so I ignored what just happen and went on doing my work but I felt like my ear eas kinda popped and i didnt find it worrying at all feeling confident that it would go away so after school I went home and then I felt something and sorry if it sounds wierd for this is the only way i can explain it, there was a feeling as if everytime i swallowed there was something between my throat and nose if you ever had this you can see feel how this is kinda of annoying but isnt a big deal so i went to sleep and ten the next day my ears felt kinda uneven still and i was coughing with a stuffy nose but I didnt really care about my ears because i knew they would go away after my cold becuase i Ive felt the feeling before were i had a cold and my ears were a bit clogged but then i tried to keep popping them but it really didnt work sometimes and i would still get that breathing from the nose thing on my ear but the crazy thing is that it would switch ear sometimes and then when i tried popping my ears it would pop my ears but the thing with my nose wouldnt go away so i would usally go to bed or if it happen during class i would put my head down on the ear thats following my breathing and if i had my head down in class and breathed my nose it would go away but when i picked it back up it would stay so i would have to keep it there for a while for about 5 to 4 minutes and it would go after I pick up my head and the same thing in the bed i would be able to sleep without having to mess with my nose becuase i dont have that issue when i put my head down apperently and i could sometimes hesr my voice from only one my my ears when I tried popping them but the ear changes most of the time i can hear my voice louder in my right ear or left so I got kinda scared and actually got anxiety from this, note im only 14 which isnt fun at my age. So I got scared and went to the doctor and they ask what was going on but i kinda changed the story i never tolded them about my breathing nose problem that only happens sometimes in the day or about the times i could hear my voice from my ear a little bit louder and all i said was my ear felt pressured which it did and then she came to the conclusion that It was my alergies and wax with a fluid in my ear which sounded reasonible so she could take out all the wax and she prescribed me Zaytex which I didnt feel like it helped me much at all but i took it becuase i just wanted my ears back to normal. I then started to complain to my mom that i wanted another doctors appointment which she said okay but she wanted to put something in my ear to make it easier to let them take out the wax which sounded good at the time but when we got home she said ahe wanted to put olive oil in my ear and not that we are a mexican family but my mom truly does suprising things and fixes some problems with needing a doctor but i knew olive oil wouldnt help my ear at all and when before she put it in my hear im not gonna lie i regret it but she tried i love her for that and it took me almost about 1 hour looking at a eye dropper with olive oil note that when i say an eye dropper it actual was an eye dropper she just cleaned it out really good and put olive oil in the dropper. But after i made my mind up she was kinda frustarated becuase i would say to do it but then change my mind which i can understand because my mom was just trying to help me all she could and she couldnt really understand what was going on inside my head which i understand becuase she was just trying to help all she could and as i said before i love her for that. So i made up my kind to put olive oil in my ear to loosen the wax and so she put it in but when she put in in she put more then 3 drops she pretty much put like 6 and i read about olive oil softening wax and it said 3 to 4 but anyways my ear was filled with olive oil and i tried getting up but she put my head down before i could and just to let you know i was laying my head down so my head was down and i just the oil sit there for a bit but when i stood up no olive oil came out at all and i could here from my left ear which was filled with the oil and so i paniced almost having an attack and put my anxiety that was created from this ear problem pushed to the roof and so she made me an appointment and my mom told me to sleep on the side with olive oil which i did and sometimes i would even wake up during my sleep to take some out which didnt work it would clear up a tiny but but then get replaced with more and i would go back to not hearing on the ear it wasnt completley gone becuase i put music on it and i could here it so that calmed me down just a bit hoping the docters could clean it out so when I woke up olive oil was still in my left ear which was very scary so my appointment started at 1:30PM and i got the olive oil put in at 1:00AM on a wensday and my appointment was on a thursday bascally the next day so when i got my doctor note that its a kid doctor. So when i got to my doctor they took out all the wax and note before i put olive oil in my ear there was a bit of pain in my ear and i cant remember if it was in both or in one but i had a little bit of pain that wasnt to bad. So they had me lay down on the ear without olive oil and the ear with olive oil is the one they worked on first so they put peroxide in the one ear and it was just peroxide itself and i head the bubbly sound and then they git a little bottle filled with peroxide and water and it had a little tube connected with the bottle and they put it in my left ear and squished the bottle or something to push the water in my ear which kinda hurt becuase of the sound and i felt dizzy after they did that ear and note that the wax cane out with just using the bottle with the peroxide and water and i think cleaned out the olive oil to but then my other ear was next and this one was the hardest and they did the same proccess and put peroxide in my ear and then after 2 minutes got the bottle and squshed it and just know they had me lay down to put the peroxide but then i sat in a chair after that and so they got the bottle and squished it and it didnt move much so they got more peroxide and put it my ear having me to lay down and then after that they tried the bottle thing and it just wouldt come out and note when they put the peroxide the 2nd time they waited 5 minutes. So when nothing came out my doctor was going to prescribed me some ear drops to lossen the ear wax but i told her no and i told her to try taking it out with a little stick or tool they use and it hurt wen they pulled it out but then when she got it i could hear a little bit better and just know that when she pulled it out it hurt bad but when i was done i stood up and felt really dizzy and mabey becuase they were putting a lot of stuff in my ear but when i talked it sounded as if i was hearing my voice would sound and if im hearing only a little bit of sound from my ear and the rest from my mouth but it didnt sound as im hearing my voice loud from my ears which is kinds the problem to i can hear it kinda loud but mostly sounding wierd and sound itself sounds loud with a bit of a muffle sometimes sounds even hurt a bit but thats probaly from my ear infection thats starting that my doctor told me about but prescribe me antibiotics which im taking and im even taking Zaytex now and sound itself sounds kinda loud and my voice sounds wierd and i cant tell if its only on 1 ear or both but i just dont know what wrong and mabey it sounds wierd becuase of the pain of my ear infection which dosent really hurt that bad or even mabey its becuase it hurt when she took out my ear wax from my right ear or it could be the fluids that she was talking about and know the 1st time i went to the doctor se trued to take iut the wax but she just told me to use home remedies and stuff like that or try the water with oroxide truck but right now sound isnt the same like before i wasnt sick and she the 1st time i went she also said i fluids in my ear which i didnt ask the doctor if i did the 2nd time i went again but i had 2 diffrent doctors and she didnt say if i had alergies she just said we will clean your ears and you have an ear infection but everything sounds a little to loud with a bit of a muffle but not to much and i dont know what i have i would think i have (PET) or even (ETD) but its been a day since ive had my wax and stuff takin out and right now im typing this and just got ut takin out yestarday and im taling the antiboitics and i have to take them 2 times a day and ima still take they Zaytex just to make sure and i cant really explain how everything sounds exactly but mostly i can describe a bit louder,mabey echoi, or louad with a muffle but thats all i can do and mabey i need time to get my hearing back or soemthing but hope i can heal and if not then Ima see a ENT mabey which i havent done so if you have any sugesstions or anything to tell me that would help that would be really nice becuase its really scary and just life changing and please pray for me for thats all i need.. -Luis"
"Otitis Media","Hi everyone.Last night I started with some severe ear pain, a few hours later it burst. Blood and puss came out of my ear, and for the rest of the night puss continued to come out.I have been to the GP this morning and she had given me some antibiotics.The problem is, I am travelling to Greece on Monday, and she said she couldn't confirm if I will be able to fly.I have to go back on Saturday for her to check how the infection is clearing up.I'm anyone's precious expierenxe, has an ear infection and burst ear drum stopped people flying?And what would be the reason it stopped me? Would it be the pain?Other questions I have would be when will I start to feel normal again and when will the pain ease, because I can't see me enjoying a holiday while feeling like this.I have 4 days to get better, including today. Any help would be amazing! I'm very worried. "
"Otitis Media","I woke up 5 hours ago and my right ear had a ringing bell noise and also seems blocked, after taking a further nap the problem consists and there is no pain,, very similar in having water in it, I havnt been swimming also no water has entered my ear canal. would anyone know what this is?"
"Otitis Media","So I won't describe my story in length (unless anyone wants me to) but basically I have a perforated eardrum from a grommet that I had 6 years before it arose.I've had another grommet since, only for it to do basically next to nothing. This was almost 4 years ago. There was a scare two appointments ago (eardrum collapsing or something?) which I had to have a CT scan for (which came back fine).After the scare they suggested me having another operation but when the CT scan came back fine they said it was up to me.I'm struggling to make a decision. The original reason why I got referred to ENT was because the perforated eardrum was causing constant ear infections which nothing seemed to stop (various medications were tried). I haven't had any ear infections since but I have on and off ear pain every week, and this Autumn/winter was particularly worse as I went half deaf in the bad ear several times and had the blocked up changing pressure water feeling in my ear for a few days once or twice.I don't see it making much difference now (I can put up with the pain) but my worry is that if I don't have the operation then the problem will come back because I didn't do anything to stop it (which is what is happening to my grandmother now, 20-30 years later)"
"Otitis Media","It is day four after the op. I now have a very very loud ""heartbeat"" sound constantly in my ear now, can't sleep and it is like a brum beating. Anyone else had this?"

"Otitis Media","About a month ago I got sick and my ear clogged really badly. Didn't think much of it initally, but after a while I went to an ENT and also had an audiogram done because I was scared I was suffering from hearing loss. The audiotest was perfect, showed no hearing loss in either ear, also I had no fluid in my ear and that my eustachian tube is working properly.Yet my ear still feels almost exactly the same and hasn't gotten much better at all. I can hear voices and talk on the phone fine from that ear, but my left ear is picking up more sound than my right ear is. Also I get a weird tingling sensation on the actual ear itself multiple times a day. I also had ringing in that ear, but it's mostly gone away.The ENT said it could take a couple months to fully recover, but i'm scared because I have seen barley any improvement. Does anyone know what the problem could be? This has been destroying my concentration and making my life miserable lately. I'm hoping this isn't permanent."
"Otitis Media","Hi, I went to my doctors 3 weeks ago because I was feeling dizzy and had nausea, and the doctor said I had Labyrinthitis which is an inner ear infection. About 2 weeks into it I started having a ringing in my ear which has gone on for like a week now, I'd give it about a 6/10 on loudness. I was wondering if the ringing will go away or is it permanent now because I've started to get worried about it. Thank you"
"Otitis Media","Hi. I have posted here before and someone suggested that I have ETD, judging by my symptoms. I then googled ETD and all of my symtpoms match (constantly blocked ears, severe pain during landing on a plane, a need to swallow in order to hear, random pain in ears and surrounding bones etc.). It all started around 3 years ago after an ear infection and has made my life very uncomfortable. I also have constant mucus build up in my nose and throat, which suggests an allergy. When I eat spicy food, especially raw chilli, my nose drains and my ears pop, which results in me regaining a perfect hearing.I went to see a private ENT the other day and he diagnosed me with Otosclerosis. He performed an audiometry, which showed that I have a sudden drop in hearing at the mid frequency range in both ears. Right ear goes down to 30 dB at 1.5k Hz and gradually increases from 30 dB to 10 dB between 2k and 6k (perfect at the lows and very tops). Left ear is at 15 dB from 125-500 Hz, 40 dB at 1.5k-3k Hz and 15 dB at 4k-6k Hz (never perfect, but best at very top, and better at the lows). The doctor didn't perform any further tests and automatically concluded that I have Otosclerosis.However, I know it doesn't fully add up. 1.) Otosclerosis does not normally cause any pain, and I often experience pain in both ears. 2.) The doctor did not explain or examine the mucus build up in my nose. 3.) He did not explain the severe sudden pain during a landing on a plane. 4.) He said that the improvement in my hearing when eating spicy foods is related to the increased blood flow to my brain, which results in higher levels of oxygen near my hearing nerve, which in turn makes me hear a bit better (but did not take into consideration that it causes my nose to fully drain). 5.) My ears feel stuffy, again, NOT a symptom of otosclerosis. 6.) Apparently, otosclerosis causes diminished hearing at lower frequnces rather than the mid and the high range?I am not denying that I have Otosclerosis, however, I am almost convinced that I also have ETD. I have been checked by 3 doctors in the past 3 years and none of them diagnosed or even considered ETD. I am getting increasingly frustrated, as I feel that I am simply being overlooked and that I am not receiving the appropriate professional care that I am paying lots of money for. I am planning another visit to a different ENT, but before I do, any help would be very appreciated, as I am very concerned about my health right now.Thank you!"
"Otitis Media","Hi everyoneLately my ears have been blocked. Like my hearing feels really reduced. The other day I went to the doctor and he checked my ears. He said they were perfect. Is there anything else that could be wrong ? He did check them twice. And I thought this would go away but it's not and I really don't like it. Any advice ?

"Otitis Media","Hi, I'm pretty desperate for some advice!I'm a 24 year old female and have been having problems with my left ear. 10 days ago I was picking my son up from school and my ear started throbbing, it quickly got more painful and I went and had a bath to ease the pain. That night and the following day I used a hot water bottle and had a few pops and had a clear liquid come out, the next day I woke up with a fullness in my ear, the feeling you get when you have water in your ear and it's like I can hear myself speaking in my head, I've had this feeling for 8 days now. I have a slight ringing but I don't really notice it until I'm laying in bed and it's quiet.

"Otitis Media","I've been having some problems with my hearing lately, and don't really know who to turn to about this. A bit of background, Im a twenty year old male student who has a history of anxiety, and everyone I talk to about this, including the GP says its down to that. The hearing problems I've had have been getting so bad that theyre all I can think and I've been really depressed as a consequence. Music is my passion ever since I was young and the thought of going deaf makes me incredibly low. I spend a lot of my time involved in music: I'm in a band, DJing and produce a lot of my own musicThe problems started at around Christmas time when I was producing a new song, which involved spending many hours in front of speakers tweaking and changing things repeatitively over days. I've been doing this for around a year now and never had any problems before. The volume itself was never uncomfortably loud, and I could easily talk to someone sat next to me but I'm starting to expect that the extended exposure has caused some problems.It started with tinnitus, which I had had before. From my own experience the best way to deal with it from before was to try and ignore it, so that is what I did. However the tinnitus got worse whenever I would listen to music (never through headphones) and I would get a sensation of fullness in my ears and muffled hearing accompanied with an extreme sensitivity to noise. After this had lasted for about a week and a half I decided to go the GP about it who told me it was probably viral and would go away on its ownWhilst admittedly it did get a bit better over the course of about 3 months, mainly from taking it incredibly easy in terms of noise exposure (earplugs whenever i felt they were necessary) whenever I would start to make music again the fullness, tinnitus and pain would come back. I've also noticed that whenver background noise is high I find it hard to hear detail in things (for example in the supermarket, or on a busy street Ill find the sound of cars quieter than usual or not hear my footsteps etc almost if what Im hearing is being blended) Right now it is at an all time high and I really don't know what to do about it. The tinnitus is louder and I find it very hard to tolerate noise, my ears are really full and whenever I blow into them i get a loud squeak.I had a hearing test last week at an opticians (odd i know) but was told my hearing was fine and not to worry about it, but I've been reading a lot about hidden hearing loss that is extremely common in people my situation and think I may try and see an audiologisst about it. As someone who has suffered from depression in the past music was always my escape and something that managed to keep my mind occupied, the thought of having to give it up makes me incredibly low, but equally what im experiencing right now is making me very depressed.

"Otitis Media","Hi, my name is Sarah. I have come here really hoping to get some advice regarding medication and possible ototoxicity.Basically, each time I try a new medication my ears really suffer to the point where I cannot continue because I am scared of what I might be doing to my hearing.Since being diagnosed with MAV I have tried Propranolol, which did work (for 3 months) but then the dizziness came back and rather than go to a higher dose I asked my GP if I could try Topiramate instead. This worked well for the dizziness too but ended in disaster. I was ok on 25mg but then I went up to 50mg and within a week my ears felt strange. I shrugged this off and carried on but then my hearing began zoning in and out?(not completely), a bit like I was hearing under water. I noticed almost as soon as I took a tablet sometimes that my hearing went quieter. I carried on about 3-4 weeks on the 50mg. This culminated in a blocked ear feeling, ear pain/pressure, hyperacusis and numbness. It took three weeks after discontinuing Topiramate to get back to (almost) normal after this.I was given a hearing test about 5 weeks after this and there was no hearing loss registered. In fact the audiologist seemed to indicate that my hearing might be slightly better?I went onto Betahistine then, which caused no notable side effects but didn't really work either.I then tried Venlafaxine but had the blocked ear feeling/pressure and sensitivity virtually straightaway (and slight tinnitus as well) and had to discontinue after less than a week. I tried it again and the same thing happened. My glands came up also.I was then prescribed Zonisamide (50mg a day) and almost straightaway I felt something happen in my head, like a detached feeling and my ears went strange again. By the 5th day my glands were swollen in my neck, the back of my head hurt and my ears feel very painful and like there was pressure round them! I stopped, then tried a lower dose (25mg) but my ears still felt blocked?and there was pressure and pain.I was then prescribed Amitriptyline. This time my glands didnt come up but after 3 days on 5mg, and then 3 days on only 1mg, my ears are feeling so block/pressured and there was some pain again that I dont think I can go on with this.This is really getting me down as I need something to control the dizziness and each time I try something new, the same thing happens.Does it sound like I suffered ototoxicity with the Topiramate and now whatever damage was done is being exacerbated each time I take a migraine preventative medication?Does anyone have any advice for me? I cant get a satisfactory explanation for why this happens from anyone. Thanks if you can help."
"Otitis Media","Hey guys, first time here, so anyway I had some small inner ear pain for almost 2 weeks, I just got my antibiotics from my doctor and i didn't get my referral to see the ENT yet, No drainage from the ear, jus pain along with migrains and neck pain a lil (not too serious tho) I can breath fine and everything, it's jus a sharp pain really, that's it, I hear a small ringing to but I can hear perfect, Before I hit the ENT what do you guys think it is??"

"Otitis Media","I have had problems with my ears for 2 years now. My problems began with the insides of my ears being very itchy. I went to my doctors and was told that it was a wax problem. I had them syringed, but the problem did not go away. My doctor then gave me some ear spray (optomize) which worked great when I was using it, but the problem came back when the spray ran out. Eventually the itchiness seemed to go away (although I still get a bit of itchiness now any again). That problem was soon replaced with a new problem?whenever I lie on my left side to go to sleep and lift my head up off the pillow, my ear will pop. This is a very loud pop and will wake me up if I am asleep. It feels like it is to do with the pressure build up inside my ear. I also get a lot of crackling whenever I swallow or yawn.6 months ago I went to see an ENT specialist. She told me that it was an ear wax problem and vacuumed the ears out and gave me some antibiotic drops. This did not help at all. I went to see another ENT specialist today. He looked in my ears and told me that it wasnt a wax problem. He sent me for a hearing test and a pressure/ fluid test and said that the results were normal. So the only help he gave me was to ignore the popping!!! Not very helpful when I cant sleep on my left side. The popping is so severe than I am worried that I will damage my ears. Has anyone had similar problems?Thanks"
"Otitis Media","I remember many many years ago that after going to a very loud pop concert I would get a ringing sensation in my ears, annoying but it would go after a few hours, well at 66 it seems to have come back (without a vist to a band performance), very slight ringing sensation but there all of the time. it is exacerbated by having the radio or tv on the noise in my ear seems to react to the tone of the sound and almost 'buzzes' sometimes.Anyone any experience of this please ?"

"Otitis Media","Doctor at ER told me I had fluid behind my ears which was viral , not bacterial. Therefore no antibiotic prescribed but rather a steroid nasal spray.

Has anyone experienced this and how long did it take before your ears felt back to normal?

"Otitis Media","Hi,2 weeks ago I stupidly syringed my ear at home myself (with one of those Otex bulb syringes from the chemist) thinking I had a slight earwax blockage. I didn't use earwax first, and everything seemed fine until I noticed this awful broken whistling sound in my left ear that night. One week on andI have bad ringing (feels like it's in both ears but it's hard to say) and a broken whistling in my left ear. IMy left ear also felt full and crackly (as if it was a wax blackage) but as I was scared about the noises I went to the doctor. He said that my right ear was fine but my left ear had a red patch on it (about a quarter of it was red) and was sitting at an angle or something and he gave me a course of antibiotics. Well, now one week later I have finished the course of antibiotics and still have these awful noises in my ear! Plus I can sort of feel a tickling as if fluid is moving about? Can anyone help me understand what's going on? Thanks so much"
"Otitis Media","Background info: on holiday in Vietnam, I had my ears cleaned by a barber but I did it for the experience; it was not necessary since my ears were clean. He did a bad job and hurt my ear canal, no damage to eardrum. After the clean, my ear canals were hurting, like they've been scraped. I just left my ears like that and see if it heals on itself. I also showered and swam without earplugs in Vietnam's waters.A month later, I come back to Australia. Ear canal pain subsided unless touched it with a Q-tip which is how I clean my ears. I continue to shower without earplugs like I've always in my life. There is minimal wax built up.Side note: since I shower without earplugs, my ear gets wet so the wax is really soft. I clean with a Q-tip all my life. I have never had a problem with hard wax or any ear-related.Now, I go to another GP to fix my hurting ear canal. He prescribes me with Otodex eardrops and I followed the recommended dosage for around 3 days. Everyday, showering without earplugs and Q-tipping to clean and monitor pain of ear canal. It got better so I stopped using it as that is what the doctor said to do.A few weeks pass by and I notice that hard wax has been building up in my ear canal. Sometimes they fall out themselves and sometimes I Q-tip it out. So I go see another GP and he says he sees a lot of white and concludes that it's the Q-tip cotton. He suggests that I wear earplugs (and I do now) and gives me eardrops to aid removal but instead, it floods my ear with more wax. Once my ear gets full, I ask my father to get it out for me using tweezers etc. He was very careful and got out the whole thing, in one go. It was like CARPET on my ear canals. I examined it closely and concluded that it was dead skin with wax inside. The dead skin must be my ear canal trying to heal itself but the wax is interferring with the process?Finally, I go back to my original GP (last week), he prescribes me with Otodex and I've been using it for the past 5 days consistenly. He says I have inflammed ear canals. I've removed a bunch of wax/dead skin with some tools carefully and it seems good now.My question is, can this be solved any better? Any tips or prevention methods? How can I restore my ear back to it's original state where I can finally shower without ear plugs and Q-tip right after."

"Otitis Media","I had a cold for 2 weeks, just when it was almost gone, it turned into an ear infection in my right ear. (I haven't been to a doctor, but I know it was an ear infection with stabbing pain, muffled hearing etc..). Now,a week later, the pain in my ear is gone since a few days but what has remained is that I can hear my own heart/ pulse in the ear that had an ear infection.It is continously, sometimes even wakes me up at night, makes it impossible to focus/sleep/study and I can't take it much longer. I have no pain, just that noise still slightly muffled hearing.What could this pulsating noise after an ear infection be? Could it just be ear wax or fluid that's still in the way (although I have no pain anymore)? Did anyone have this before / how could I get rid of it?(I CAN'T go to an ENT doctor here, I'm in Canada for one semester and you can't just go to an ENT here. Also they will send me away anyway, if i have a pulse sound but no pain etc... I'm just asking for advice here because I can't take it anymore)Thank you, sorry for my English"

"Otitis Media","I have had a hole in my ear since I was 6 (result of grommet). I had tons of ear infections 5/6 years ago and after another grommet I got diagnosed with a perforated eardrum. I'm currently on the waiting list for an operation (so still under ENT at hospital).For the past few weeks my ear has been blocked, and then for the past few days I've noticed my hearing has been getting worse with only little pain. I don't have a cold or anything. I'm wondering if it's another ear infection but all the ones I had before I never had hearing loss.My next appointment isn't till April so I'm not sure what to do.

"Otitis Media","Hi. My 18 month old toddler has been on 2 different antibiotics to treat his ear infection. We went today for a check up and the infection is still there, so he was prescribed yet another 10 days of antibiotics. I am not happy about having my kid on antibiotics for a month! He doesn't have a fever or pain. Has anyone been on a similar situation? if so, have the antiiotics finally worked? Thank you!"
"Otitis Media","So it's been 5 days now since my left ear started ringing. I'm a stay at home mom so I'm not around loud noises or anything. All I was doing was some laundry and playing with my daughter when it started ringing. I didn't think anything of it at the time but it never went away. I went to see a dr the following day and he checked my ears, nose and throat and said everything appeared fine. There was no blockage or infection but it still is ringing and feels like it's blocked or something. My hearing seems fine other than the ringing. Loud noises make it worse. I have no other symptoms other than I may get a headache from the ringing. Will this go away on its own or should I see another dr for a second opinion?

I could only hear things close to my ear, but that was a struggleStupidly I never got my right ear checked out due to the life issues with my left ear and I used my left ear to help a lot once fixed (But can only hear 75%). Im now a married man with a toddler daughter but Im struggling to hear her, plus my work is getting affected with my new role, to be fair I had this issue for years.Weirdly come Easter 2 years ago, I got full hearing back on my right ear, it lasted for 2 weeks (Was in hearing heaven) however during the last final days it felt like bubbles at the back of my ear and every few hours to get my hearing back I had to tilt my head backwards to regain my hearing, however after those 2 weeks i went back deaf again in my right ear.I am now back at the hospital to see what this issue is and was wondering if anyone has experienced this before? (I hardly doubt it but worth a ask)"

Since then, the abscesses still come up regular. Dentist took x-rays, hospital did same, nothing shows up. Is there some connection here?

"Otitis Media","My eustachian tube in my right ear is still completely blocked after flying with a cold a week ago.

"Otitis Media","Well I've gone to my GP twice and all she says is that its nothing, just a sign of a cold (yet I've NOT developed a cold in the two months that the ear has been clogged and I've lost about 75% of the hearing in the ear with it being clogged, I've tried various methods to unclog it but nothing has worked).The issue started a month or so after I was put onto Gabapenton at first it wa just for a few hours or so that it would feel clogged, then one day I woke up and it wasn't going away - booked an appointemnt with my GP only to learn she wasn't in for a month, so I got the appointent for as soon as she got back. Was told if I thought it was an emergency to go to the ER (which I likely should have dun so - but I didn't as I didn't think they'd do anything).Well saw my GP told her I think I have an ear infection (something I've not had since I was 10 years old - i'm now almost 40), she said no its not an infection that the ear is clear and that she thinks its just from a cold. Well its not cleared up but she insistats it from a cold (that isn't developing).We're flying out in a few hours to visit the inlaws, but I am worried that the hearing loss is perm since nothing mediclaly has been dun for it. I'm kicking myself for not going to the ER but at the same time going to the local ER isn't always good (wait times can be upwards of 18 hours for their non-emergency classed people).Not sure what I am looking for, but I do wish to know if other's have had issue with gabipenton and hearing loss, or having a clogged ear has shows no sign of infection with 75% hearing loss that does come back once what ever it is is found and treated.I'm not on the drug anymore, but I do have Fibro and am a T1 diabetic (with no complications from it)."

"Otitis Media","Is ETD specific to this tube not closing properly, or are there various problems that may occur as part of this condition?My symptoms suggest to me that the tube doesn't close properly I.e. Find it difficult to unpop my ears, my ears pop too readily (every time I swallow in fact) .Now, I have a cold at the moment, and have noticed that as a result of my sinuses and nose being blocked up, the symptoms above actually improve, suggesting to me that adding mass (in this case snot! Sorry!) to the tube makes it close properly.Does this make sense, and if so is there some sort of procedure that can permanently add mass to the tube so that it closes properly. I saw recently on YouTube an operation to insert silicone into the lining of the tube, I assume to bulk it out so that it closes properly."

I am just starting to do reading about tinnitus and/or ruptured ear drum. Because this is the first day he is experiencing this opposed to an ongoing condition, I am not sure what words I want to use in my google search.Should he see an ear, nose and throat doctor or an audiologist?I am a widow and this is the first medical issue my son has had so I am somewhat nervous as I write this.

"Otitis Media","When i burst my eardrum earlier this year, the ENT that i saw gave me 'sofradex' ear drops to put in the eardrum.

"Otitis Media","I picked up a bad cold on holiday (canary islands Spain) and when I flew back, my ears clogged up and I felt so much movement inside them, it was very scary. Then, after landing I lost about 70% hearing in my left ear. I had brief tinnitus which has now subsided thankfully. I am 30 years old by the way. My gp is treating it as an ear infection which is fair enough, as the ear drum is red, and a little painful. But, I am worried that it could be sudden sensorineural hearing loss which results in permanent hearing loss if not treated within 2-4 weeks. I put this to my gp and she never heard of the term as she sheepishly had to look it up. This is precisely why a lot of sufferers leave treatment too late because they are misdiagnosed and treated for a general ear infection, which is understandable I guess. Anyway, my point is, do I take the risk and just go with the general ear infection treatment of antibiotics, nasal spray, sudafed etc which I am on now or do I be more forceful and fearful that it could be sshl, which is classed as a medical emergency. The problem is many people are diagnosed too late to save their ears because they are initially diagnosed with more common text book things, which is understandable I guess as they are GP's and not God or specialists on the entire human body. Im thinking of going to a&e as my hearing has not improved, although my flu like symptoms have almost gone. The problem also is, that, they say that hearing could take a couple of weeks or more to recover after an ear infection, but this is also the window of opportunity in which sudden sensorineural hearing loss can be saved so you kind of only know in hindsight,having missed the opportunity to recover hearing from sudden sensorineural hearing loss.

"Otitis Media","HelloI am a 25 year old male and have chronic tinnitus for the past three months. I am struggling with the ringing and have already spent coinsiderable money on treatments.my story begins. i woke up 4 months ago and heard a high pitched tone. i waited a week and then went to a local GP. the GP looked at my ears and said that they were heavily impacted with wax. she then proceeded to irrigatre my left ear. i felt that the irrigation took a long time and occassionaly during the procedure i felt a couple of pinhing pains and pulled my head back. i also found the water fairly cold. after carrying out that irrigation she looked at my right ear and said to use drops and come back in a week.i have got my ears irrigated in the past but the nurses who did it would not irrigate until a week of drops was carried out. i felt very worried leaving the office incase the GP had damaged my ear.i went back the week later and the GP irrigated my second ear. I still had ringing and infact i found the sound was worse after the irrigation. i found the ringing in the ear that was irrigated without the use of drops was much worse.i went back to the GP and met a different doctor a week after. he looked at my ear and said there was now fluid behind the my left ear and he put me on steriods to drain it out.I got my hearing tested and i have no measurable hearing loss. i infact have 0dB hearing at some of the higher frequencies. i was then referred to an ENT and was in with him for only 10 mins and got no information, he only said do i want an MRI.the riging in the ear that was irrigated without the use of drops is irritating me heavily i can hear it during the day as well asnight. my other ear dose not bother me during the day.can irrigaiting ears without the preuse of drops casue tinnitus. my ear drum was not perforated but can the act of water hitting the ear drum damage the ossicles or in any way physically damage the ear causing tinnitus. i completely regret going to the GP and she irrigating my left ear without drop as i am worried that this casused my tinnitus. since that day i have spent 1000 euro on different appointments including accupuncture. This Tinnitus is causing me a serious problem and i have recently just started a new job and the tinnitus is effecting me. will it ever go i am only 25 and honestly feel like i am going to have to stop work because of it. Has that GP casused my tinnitus by carrying out an irrigation without the pre use of softening dropsthank you for taking the time to read my query"
"Otitis Media","Hello; my name is Fred and I am 27 years old. I have been having debilitating symptoms that i think i might be due to my ears for 2 years now.The day after my 25th birthday I woke up to a hangover worse than usual. My ears felt full like there was something in them and i felt dizzy - not in the sense that the room was spinning I just felt off balance. I also threw up a few times but put this down to the hang over.This feeling has never went away and has got progressively worse to the point i have now had to take time off work and in the last month I have spent 90% of the time lying down. My vision has also went blurry over these years.I have been to the doctor who said it was labyrinthis and it would go away in 2 weeks (i wish). I have been back and forth about 20 times , put on antibiotics five times and have only recently got referred to an ent who has put me forward for an mri which will happen in a few months. Does this sound like your typical inner ear infection? Im worried its something more sinister.Main symptoms are: feeling pressure deep inside ear. Feels hot sometimes and when i can tilt my head it can itch like theres liquid behind the eardrum.Dizzyness constantly or feeling off balanceBlurry vision to the point i need two prescriptionsSwollen stomach occasionally , nausea Feel like i want to die/ lie down all the time.Help please."

"Otitis Media","Going to try to keep this short...I am an electronic music producer and two years ago, I was playing about with a synthesiser at a medium sort of volume, when all of a sudden, a freakish soundwave produced this harrowing shock to my right ear. My right speaker was, at the time, closer to me than my left speaker due to my positioning. Whilst the volume was not excessive, it was the frequency that did it. I screamed as the pain was that unexpected and painful, nothing like I have ever experienced before. From then on, my right ear has been full, painful and very sensitive, especially to the sound of syntheziser that seemed to have caused this, even if I have the volume at a ridiculously low level (below talking volume). My ear has been full, warm to the touch, fluttering now and then and very crackly. I went to an ENT specialist and he said it was Eustacian Tube Dysfunction and he said the pressure in my ears were not equal. Then I went back 6 months later and he measured my ear pressure which were 'almost perfect', whilst my hearing was perfect and he was happy to discharge me due to my improving condition, although I didn't feel as though I should be discharged. 9 months on from my last appointment, I have another one coming up in a couple of weeks because my condition has remained the same. I have good days and bad days. I feel so dizzy and disorientated at times and fatigued. One hour I feel fine but the next hour I can feel dizzy and feel like there is an asparagus stuck in my ear. I don't feel myself and it affects me and makes me feel irritable and I feel cognitively different than my usual self. Thankfully I don't suffer from tinnitus and my hearing is very good. All that I can come up with is that I have some nerve damage in my ear. I just want a definitive diagnosis so I can deal with it. ETD just isn't cutting it for me because that's not even supposed to be lasting for this long. I appreciate any help and replies. Thanks "
"Otitis Media","Hi,I hope you're well.For over the last month I have had crackling in both of my ears every time I swallow & they generally seem quite full as well. I went to my GP after 3 weeks & he checked my ears, seemed quite dismissive & said that this happens after a cold or flu. I informed him that I haven't had a cold or flu so he said I must just clean my ears too much. He told me to wait it out & didn't give me anything. I went back again last week. He checked my ears & said it didn't seem like I had an infection or anything & seemed dismissive I told him that something must be wrong because this isn't normal. He prescribed me Sofradex ear drops. I've tried popping my ears & all sorts. The only thing that seems to work is when I bring up Phlegm. I'm ok for the first second & then the crackling returns! Anybody have any advice as this is really starting to get to me now.Kind Regards"

"Otitis Media","I have a strange ear problem and would love to get some thoughts on it. My left ear reacts badly when in a noisy environment, this can be caused by music (I have to keep my headphones really quiet) or just people talking. It's particularly bad when out with a bunch of people because loud voices can be quite tough to handle. Two things happen, one is a distortion of sound, as if I'm listening to a speaker that's having problems and making distored shhh sort of noises. The other is hard to explain and feels like something sort of flapping in my ear sort of like the pressure is changing.I've had this problem for a number of years now and it's not going away. I've seen two specialists and neither has been able to offer much guidance. I will pass the standard hearing tests with flying colours because those sorts of low level noises I don't have a problem with. My hearing is fine and my problems are more like an overlay to my hearing that get in the way and just make things uncomfortable. One specialist was able to offer no assistance and the other could only suggest holding my nose/mouth and blowing to try to pop my ears. This sometimes does help but if I'm in a busy restaurant for example then all the chatter noise will soon set my ear off again.Would like to get some advice as my only option at present is to avoid noisy situations."
"Otitis Media","I have a couple of questions...1. I am in a fairly loud band, and usually use an ear plug in the ear that is on the drummer side, so my left ear. After a practice, the right side ear (opposite side of drummer) can feel dull for a few minutes then goes back to normal. Is this because it reacts to sound, and quietens down (like eyes do to bright light), or is it likely I am slowly damaging it?2. I don't know if this is related, but a couple of days ago, I woke up with my left ear feeling full/dull. This is weird because if it was from noise I thought it would be the right ear, which is usually less protected. So i thought it might be something other than noise induced.The dullness has gone now, it lasted about a day. But there is a faint ringing, noticeable at night and if i put my finger in the ear.Any ideas what this is, and will it go away?If it is of any interest, I also currently have a tight/sore neck and sometimes sleep with my neck at odd angles, and it was also my second night in a row with about 4-5hrs sleep.Thanks (and I'll keep it updated with it it goes away, gets worse or anything for anyone else that expereices this!)"

"Otitis Media","Hi, can anyone help me with this?More than 25 years ago I had an acute ear infection which completely blocked my ears with fluid. A second course of antibiotics eventually cured that and sudafed reduced the blockage but it has never gone away and is now getting worse.I can't confirm any loss of hearing though I suspect it may be dulled. I have permanent crackling in both ears when I swallow and production of fluid in the left, which drains down the eustacian tube into the back of my throat. It is increasingly irritating and I am constantly trying to suck the stuff down but can never eliminate it. Symptoms are worst in winter but used to almost dissappear in protracted 30C + of heat.I've seen several doctors about this over the years, yet learned nothing and have no diagnosis let alone a cure.Any ideas?"

"Otitis Media","HiWanted to share my experience and get any thoughts/ opinions on additional symtoms that other people may have.I had a right ear Stapectomy in May 2015 after suffering with loss of hearing for about 18 months. Up untl that point it was unconfirmed if i had Octosclerois but the surgeon confirmed 100% after the operation.The procedure itself went great and took about an hour under a general. When i woke the surgeon was excited and said that it was successful and if i could hear improvement but was too groggy to really register. over the coming hour i could hear telephone conversations 40ft away that i wouldn;t have hear before which was great.When i got home, i felt generaly fine and felt i could move around freely, starting watching TV, eating dinner with my girlfriend and listen more to want was being said. Although after about an hour i had bleeding in my ears and was worried that the packing had come loss and went to A&E to check but was fine.All in all, it went great and my hearing had improved and was so happy to hear full conversations again. About 9 months after the op though, i started to get some new sensations such as when flying in a plane, it i did a little air burp or yawned, i felt a split second dizzy sensation in my operated ear, which really dis-oriented me. I now sometimes get this in everyday life, if i yawn in bed or if i am driving over a high hill, if i swallow or burp i can get split second dizziness like someone is pushing on my balance centre in my ear.More annoying is that when i walk now, i feel like my head is very heavy and sometimes feel slightly dizzy / nauseaus. If i stand on a crowded train, i start to feel nauseas and dizzy also and often have to get off. Over the past few months i have noticed the same symtoms in my left ear( tinnitus, hearing drop, rushing noise when i open my mouth, confused by background noise when trying to hear someone ) and recently had a hearing test which showed that the hearing is lower in this ear then my operated ear which leads me to think that i will have to get the right ear done in about the next 6 months.Am wondering if anyone has had any symtoms like this 9-12 months on from a stapectomy and any advice? ThanksHad a MRI scan done by the surgeon and he the prothesis is in perfect condition"
"Otitis Media","I have written previously, but this is my update and the full storyAbout 3 months go I burst my eardrum by accidently poking it.Went to A&E and then ENT specifialist couple of days later who said it drum had a small tear but it would heal. Specialist cleaned the ear with a spinning brush (it hurt) then gave me ear drops for the eardrum.A day later, the ear started seeping and was infected (i think). Also made the mistake of flying although was told it was ok.Took oral anti bitotics and seeping stopped.Problem I have now is that 3 months later, the eardrum has healed over (with a small scar) and a CT and MRI scan show no problems whatsoever for the bone and tissue YET i feel a loss in hearing and a constant ringing in the ears which gets worse at certain times in the day.My question is, am I stuck with this?.. or will it heal still over time.

"Otitis Media","Hello. I had vertigo (dizziness when move head) in January during this time I had a sensation of warmth inside the left ear, pulsating left ear like heart beat (i've never heard this before), ear fulness and pressure (I kept opening my mouth to release air and it also felt like something move briefly in the ear. Then this developed into a VI nerve palsy (a swelling on the brain). Does anyone know do these ear symptoms sound like an ear infection or are they symptoms due to having a swelling on the brain? thanks."
"Otitis Media","For id say 6+ months my right ear has always felt a little more clogged. Some days it's worse than others. I can remedy this by holding my nose and left ear, then blowing out. I feel the ear open up. I have also had this weird top of the head sensation on the same side that comes and goes on a daily/weekly basis. Sometimes the scalp is sore to the touch in generally the same area. I would also sometimes get an aching gland on the same right side. No swelling from what I could ever tell though. The last few days I feel all these things have escalated. sometimes the ear will ache for a few moments, sometimes my right temple will throb for a short amount of time. And my gland on that same side feels stiff. Also I have a weird pressure at the top of my head on the same side. Is this an ear infection? I never associated the top of my head pain/pressure with the ear issue, I just thought it was stress. Doctor said in March that my ear looked fine and sporadic top of head pressure was stress. I don't have any severe pain anywhere, it's more just pressure and weird sensations all on the right side (right throat, right temple, right top of head, and inner ear). I put a call into my doctor to see an ENT. Anyone know what this is? 34 year old male in good health."

"Otitis Media","Hello, I have been struggling with an ear infection for about a week now and I am in tears. The pain is unbearable!!!!! I need help but I've gotten 2 different diagnoses both of which haven't helped at all. My ear canal as well as ear drum are in a whole lot of pain. Along with the outside of my ear which radiates down to my neck and even inside my throat I can feel the pain. The first the first doctor said i have a middle ear infection. He gave me oral antibiotics and told me to take aleve for the pain. And to expect some discharge from the ear. Over night and during the day there was a small amount of pus just kinda seping from my ear but no real relief as if it had ruptured. Two days later the pain was continuing to get worse and I was ready to kill myself because nothing was helping. I got a second opinion and he said I have an outter ear infection, not a middle. He gave my antibiotic ear drops and norco for the pain. I used the ear drops the night and when I stood up after 4 minutes of letting the ear drops sit in my ear the pain got worse. So so much worse which I didn't even think was possible cause I was already crying it was so bad. I took a norco but it's not doing anything. I haven't been able to sleep and once again I'm in agony. Some please help!!! I have a theory that I have both a middle and a outer ear infection. I think that my eardrum in perforated which would account for the pus and a little bit of blood.

"Otitis Media","19 yr old female here.Okay, so I had a habit of using qtips to clean my ears, and I ended up getting an infection (pus and all) in February. It got okay after I took the meds my ENT prescribed. Then all was okay until May, when I got diagnosed with Iron Deficiency Anemia. Around that time I started feeling like wind was blowing in my right ear (a form of tinnitus, right?) but nothing more. I had dizziness, breathlessness & weakness from the anemia which went away but relapsed a month later during my period. My breathlessness went away but then I realized that my type of dizziness had changed. It was like I was on a rocking boat, and it was continuous. Went to the ENT, got told I might have a swelling in my ear so I had to take anti-vertigo meds and inhale steam daily. The anti-vertigo meds didn't help at all. Went to another ENT, this time got diagnosed with Meniere's and was prescribed diuretics, which I stopped after a week because I believed the diagnosis was wrong.A.My vertigo was constant (not as bad as they describe in Meniere's symptoms).B.I had vomitted twice for no reason in that month, but since my symptoms didn't resemble Meniere's, I thought it could be Vestibular Neuritis after all.Two weeks or so after my vertigo started, I started get a high-pitched ringing noise in my LEFT ear that I could hear loudest at night, when everything is quiet. It was pretty audible for 2-3 days but then it toned down, and since then I have only been able to hear it when going to bed/waking up/pressing my ear against the pillow. Oh and 2-3 days after it started, the ringing started in my right ear also, but it's not as bad as the left ear. Now about the vertigo, it has gotten much better since it started. It only affects me when I have bouts of breathlessness due to the still-present anemia, but otherwise most of the time I'm okay. The tinnitus isn't gone.Okay, now about the latest events. Yesterday, my left ear sort of itched so I gave in to the temptation to clean it with a qtip...after which my ear has been feeling full and my tinnitus is louder. The cartilage(?) of my outer ear is still sensitive to pain sometimes because I used to rigourously use qtips...And my ears are sensitive to loud noises now, on the whole. I still have the 'wind-blowing-in-my-ears' feeling sometimes.My question is, have all my problems been caused my ear wax being pushed into the ear with qtips? Could that be it? The thing is, the doc who diagnosed me with VN is not much of a talker (the only thing he actually MUMBLED was I might have a swelling), and his solution to everything is his personal pills and some home remedies. But he's an excellent doc. So I don't know if he didn't mention my ear wax because he didn't think it was absolutely imperative to remove? But then again the other doc didn't mention anything about ear wax either...I can't help but feel this is ear wax. Because the full feeling came on after I cleaned my ear yesterday.Please help, I want out of this mess.19 yr old female here.Okay, so I had a habit of using qtips to clean my ears, and I ended up getting an infection (pus and all) in February.

"Otitis Media","HiI was diagnosed with this tumor 3 years ago and haven't had any treatment as yet.Has anyone had the Cyberknife treatment for this tumor in the UK and if so where did you have it and were the results good. Many thanks."
"Otitis Media","My wife had her stapedectomyone week ago today. She still has not been able to get out of bed (except when somebody is physically helping her keep her balance, like to get to the toilet) for that week due to extended dizziness.Her history is that she is prone to motion sicknessand even gets carsick and sometimes airsick. (we did not know this would be such a factor when she decided to have the operation, but we are now toughing it out).The first two days she had vomiting and dry heaves constantly. That finally ended. We took her off of ODT (anti-nausea medicine) because I read it is not for motion sickness, but is rather for nausea created by anesthesiology and that did help her a great deal (it actually can make you more dizzy). She does not like taking drugs or else I would give her Bonine, but she is VERY sensitive to all drugs.Her ear looks good - no seepage, no signs of infection, no fever. Her hearing is even slightly improved. We just find it very surprising and frustrating that her dizziness will not go way - of course she is starting to worry this will be permanent.Now - it is worst when she moves her head, but it is constantly bad enough that she feels on the edge of nausea and she is not confident enough to walk by herself. This is a week since surgery.My questions: how common is this? And secondly, what can we do to speed up recovery?She has some good times, but the mornings are very rough. She feels better when she eats, but she has very little appetite.I just want to get her out of bed - but she says she feels best with her eyes closed and laying on the side of her head opposite the surgery. I have been scouring the Internet and have not seen anyone else describe these symptoms. I wonder - is it a matter of pushing her to walk more, or should we just let her heal slowly in her own comfortable but stationary way?"

"Otitis Media","Hello EveryoneThis is drastic situation my family has fallen into. My father was diagonsed with acoustic neuroma in Oct 2015 size(3.8*3.5*2.8), post which we got him admittedthe nero surgeon peformed VP shunt to lower the pressure and later performed a regular surgery to extract the tumor. Now post 4 months after the surgery he has problems like headaches and his body balance has changed, he has lost his sight and hearing capabilites with left ear. When performed a recent CT scan the size of the CT tumor (2.8*5.1*3.6) has increase drastically also mucus has started accumalting as per the reports. My doubt is can the tumor increase in such level with 4 months as it had been operated earlier?Also why is pressure increasing, Can VP shunt fail so quickly post it was installed? Is gamma knife possible in this case if I have to plan under the current size?I really would appreciate any thoughts on this as i feel somewhere this could be handled better by the experts in the past.

"Otitis Media","my left eustachian tube has been blocked for 3 years. I'm fed up. I had the drainage tube put in which solved the symptoms by about 50% immediately , but gradually the systems are going back to what they were before, even though I still have to have surgically installed hole in my eardrum. symptoms are autophony, sensitivity to certain sounds, crackling (not bothersome), feeling of pressure, and occasional heartbeat hearing (not bothersome), some minor loss of positional awareness due to things sounding closer than they are. no hearing loss. the nasal steroid isn't helping. I've been taking it for 1 year ive got 99 problems and I really would rather my autophony and sensitivity to certain noises not be 1 of themmaybe if I valslava while wearing earplugs I can force the steroid in my ear or something?

"Otitis Media","Monday the 6th I felt like my ear was clogged. On the 7th I went to an urgent care clinic after work, and they told me I had some fluid behind my ear drum. Fast forward to 6 days later, I went into an ENT cause it was worse and now I had tinnitus that was changing volumes. The ENT said he was not sure if it was sudden hearing loss or tube dysfunction. He has me on steroids, antibiotics, nasal spray and allergy meds; all while I wait for my hearing test to be done in a week or so. No sign of improvement yet. My question is, I am able to pop my ear, or rub it?and it feels better for a few seconds (like it opens up, 20 seconds max). Also in the morning it feels less full, but the ringing is louder. Then throughout the day it feels worse. If it was SHL would I be able to do that?? Youd think if I was losing my hearing I wouldnt be able to pop it?for a few seconds right? Thoughts? Im scared it will never end "
"Otitis Media","Wednesday night, my left ear started ringing. It got better, but I woke up this morning with it ringing again.I recently hurt my ear with a cotton swab. Could the ringing be related to that?What do I do?"
"Otitis Media","Hello again everyone. I know the very best thing i can do is go to the doctors regarding the ringing and i have an appointment with an ENT about this on May 6th. I am not too sure how to ask this but i will just get straight to the topic and ask: Has anyone who has ever had a cholesteatoma such as myself experienced bad ringing in the ear(s) to the point where it almost creates a headache? (A bit of history to my story, I was once at an ER for a concussion, but the bump shouldn't have been enough to cause me one says the nurse. She took an otoscope (possible spelling) and looked in my ear. She said 'You have a LOT of scarring tissue. Have you been diagnosed with a cholesteatoma?"" At the time, a year and a half ago, i dismissed the idea. I thought she was a bit nuts I was polite to her but thinking 'there's no way i could get one of those things, ever.'  Now i don't think she was so off on her opinion. A year or so later, i had sinus surgery and the ENT who did that, WONDERFUL doctor, spotted the troublesome devil that has been causing me my source of ear pain I forgot to mention the visit to the ER and of the kindly E.R GP in my last post) .I should mention it feels very full in there even though no ear fluid is found. The ringing seems to happen mostly on my right side. My lump behind my ear almost feels as though it is about a centimeter across, though things can be decieving back there, it just feels like it. Last year this lump flared up rather quickly. At times my ear pain causes me to say 'ow' either really loud, or quietly or I just plain grin and bear it, depending on how bad the situation is. Another peculiar thing my ear does is thump and bang when the pressure gets too great. It makes me want to scream out loud. Balance has been really bad this weekend as well. I fell into someone and i was really embarrassed. The ringing has been there before, but never this loud.I don't mean to wine but i know there are others out there who have the same unfortunate condition. I am also told i will have an auditory brainstem response test. Can that affect the ringing in the ears? I will also be sedated for it as i jump very easily when loud noises happen. I was told by my own GP they can get quite loud, is this true?So sorry i asked (mentioned) quite a lot here, but it is a lot of information for me to take in as well, I am just wondering if someone has had the same sort of symptoms with their cholesteatoma as well."
"Otitis Media","Hi,I am a 29 year old male and for the last 6 - 7 weeks, I have had a slight hearing loss in my right ear. The hearing loss seems to get worse in the evenings. This is when I arrive home from work, away from the outdoor and office noise and into a very quiet environment at home. When I lie down at night and tilt my head slightly towards the right, I notice that the hearing loss is not as bad as it was when I was standing up. It's as though the ear ""opens up"" after I lie down. I always have the urge to ""pop"" my ear, but that only gives me slight temporary relief for a few seconds, but even then it is not total relief. Along with the hearing loss, I also have brown/dark brown fluid coming out of my ear. The ear wax is also dark brown and sticky which is strange because my earwax has never been like this. Sometimes, I wake up in the morning and there is some of the brown fluid on my pillow and every day when I wake up I need to use about 2 or 3 cotton buds to clear the fluid from my ear in the mornings. My ear does not build up with fluid during the day unless I stick objects in my ear to try and remove ear wax.There is something wrong but I do not know whether it will heal by itself or whether I need antibiotics. From what I was reading, it seems like a have a perforated eardrum and it is possible that I damaged my eardrum because i do try to clean earwax often, but I thought it would have been healed by now, but it hasn't. There is no pain, but a bit of discomfort. I am wondering if I possibly have an ear infection or something else? I do not have any medical conditions, but I have always produced a lot of ear wax since I was a child.Many thanks for your help,"
"Otitis Media","Hi, I suffer tinnitus in left ear and also dizzy spells. Was sent to ENT in London, England and the doctor was no help whatsoever, blaming my nasal and ear problems on an allergy test with allergies I already knew about. Lately, I have had itchiness inside my ears, and the dizzyness has come back, switching from ear to ear. I'm 73 with various other illnesses, including Osteoporosis, so dread having a fall. Is it worth going back to my GP as, if he referred me back to ENT, I would probably see the same useless doctor. I gave myself ear drops and have no wax in my ears. Anyone else had similar problems and was ENT any help. I know there is no cure for tinnitus, but as I live in an extremely overpopulated area, seeing my GP is quite stressful. He is a good doctor, so everyone wants to see him and I have to use a mobility scooter to add to the mix in a very crowded surgery. Anyone got any suggestions. It would be very helpful."

"Otitis Media","I have been suffer of tinnitus for 6 years.I obtained it when I was in military having rifle test at Basic Training. I once forgot to put my earpieces on and the gunshots damaged my ears and have been having tinnitus ever since.Every doctor I have seen says it will be permanent but I won't be losing my hearings so don't worry too much.I see pretty much no one saying that they got their tinnitus cured as result of gunshots.Now does anyone here had tinnitus cured? I'm curious if someone actually got it cured."
"Otitis Media","Hi, I am a 23-year-old female and I really need some help and advice, as I am starting to get really paranoid! Where do I begin? I have been suffering from several ear problems (which I am not even sure are related to each other) for quite a while now. It all started around 4 years ago when I got an ear infection. I was prescribed antibiotics, which helped. However, the doctor also decided to put some strange pink stuff inside my ear to 'treat' it. He smeared it onto a piece of cotton and then sticked that piece onto a very sharp and long piece of metal, which he inserted very deep into my left ear. To say that it hurt would be a major understatement. It literally felt like a sharp knife being insreted into my ear and I had sharp pain for the rest of the day. Hoewever, he reassured me that it was completely normal.Antibiotics worked and my infection cleared. But then I started noticing that my left ear was feeling blocked (like when a plane takes off and your ears get stuffy, that sort of feeling but less intense). I went to another doctor, a private one this time, and she did all sorts of scans and ultrasounds and hearing analyses, and they all turned out pretty much OK. She told me that the only thing that could be causing it would be my slightly deviated septum (which is not visually noticable) and suggested a surgery. But I had a feeling that that wasn't it.Now it got to the point where my left ear is constantly SLIGHTLY blocked. Which means my hearing is a tiny bit weaker in my left ear. It doesn't really affect my hearing that much - to be honest I am used to it by now. But when it does clear out, I realise that it was blocked and in that moment I can hear properly and it feels amazing! The most bizzare thing is that my ear only clears out when I eat a raw chilly pepper! The heat from the chilli makes my nose drain and then opens up my left ear. It goes back to being blocked in about 20 minutes and stays blocked. I should also probably mention that I suffer from a dust allergy and/or hay fever.In addition to this, I was on a plane about 3 months ago, and experienced excruciating pain in my ears, which quickly moved to the centre of my head. It happened while the plane was landing and the pain was so sharp and strong that I thought something might have collapsed inside my head, like a nerve or a blood vessel, and I was genuinely concerned for my life, to the point I wanted to call the plane hosts for help. It was one of the most painful things I've ever experienced and it lasted for about 20 minutes. It stopped once the plane landed.What actually made me write this post - I went for a run this evening without my headphones. It was pretty chilly and windy outside and my ears and head got quite cold in the breeze. Then suddenly out of nowhere this horrible pain came - in my ears, my jaw, and the area of the skull around the ears. It felt like a crushing pain inside the bone, that was travelling inwards, into my head. It stopped as soon as I got home, and I also took a strong pain killer.Could this be related to the allergies and the mucus build up that might be blocking my hearing? Are the bone pain and the stuffed ear even related? Could this even be a more serious condition like a brain tumor or something like that? Or maybe that doctor did something to the inside of my ear that didn't heal properly and is affecting me now? I am a musician so my hearing is everything to me and quite frankly all this stuff is terrifying me. Any help would be very appreciated! Thank you!Alina"
"Otitis Media","Hi,I had a conversation yesterday with my GP which has essentially concluded that there's fluid in my ear. I've got sinusitus that seems to not want to respond to any of the steroid sprays that I've tried, although my GP has started me onanotherone today. The Glue Ear is really affecting me, I can tell (now I'm aware of it) that my hearing isn't what it should be and that this compounds with all my other conditions to really screw me over.I've got a lot of problems, and one of the ways I deal with that is to learn as much as I can about them. But there's so little information out there for adults with glue ear. The cause is fairly obvious in the sinusitus (my sinuses aren't draining, what hope does my ear have), and I'm irritated because the sinusitus should've been treated years ago and never was.I guess I just want to know other people's experience as adults with glue ear and especially if anyone else seems to have had it caused by sinusitus. I start with the nasal balloon tomorrow once my pharamcy's ordered one, and if that doesn't help in a few weeks I've been promised an ENT referral but I've heard that before."
"Otitis Media","Ok, i been with Tinnitus for 3 yrs. Recently I made the mistake to go to a loud place, my T went up with a piercing high pitch noise higher than the one i had and was used to it, celestone a anti inflamatory shot helped a bit but it has gotten to square one again, i should have hearing loss but surprisingly i havent lost my hearing at all, i am very confused as to wheather i have noise induced tinnitus or just something else that causes T, need an opinion, i have a high pitch noise in my left ear and now my right started to sound just a bit lower than my left, any opinions?"

"Otitis Media","Hi everyoneMy son Dinesh 37 dignosed acoustic neuroma after hearing problem and tinitus in his left ear, since last three months. AN ENT personal sugested MRI and found with a tumour of 18x12 MM.An ENT surgeon sugests micro surgery, other one neuro surgeon sugests steriostatic surgery and another neuro surgeon from a reputed hospital recomends gama knife. Now we are in a delema, whether to wait and monitor for some more time or go for SRS or gama knife instantly. Some ENT says as the tumour is very small, a surgery is not preferable. In this situation can some one help us to deside."
"Otitis Media","My son is a college student. He is hearing impaired in his right ear. He also has Patulous Eustachian Tube Dysfunction. It is treated with a tube in his ear. The tube popped out in the beginning of the semester, he saw his ENT and there was a blood clot blocking the tube, had to use drops to break it up and the soonest he could be scheduled for surgery is next week, which is the end of the semester.He was supposed to do a presentation, however because his hearing is so distorted he asked to be excused from doing the presentation. He did agree to do it after his surgery. Ok....my question finally, lolHis professor told him he should have scheduled the surgery earlier, which as many of you probably know, you can't tell the surgeon when he is going to do the surgery. She told him to call up the surgeon and tell him your grade is going to be reduced by 10% if this problem isn't corrected in time for you to do your presentation. Any suggestions???"
"Otitis Media","Hey guys, wondering if anyone else has felt this before. I was told to take a Z pack for pneumonia, and on my second day dose after taking it I got a sudden hearing loss in my right hear. Like, deafness then a loud ring. It seemed back to normal the next day but since then I've had dizziness ranging from mild to extreme and popping in both ears but more so on the right. My head feels like pressure/heavy and I have constant headaches and pain right under the ear itself leading down my neck.... It's pretty worriesome.

"Otitis Media","Hi There,I had my Stapedectomy last Friday April 1, 2016. The surgery under general went well I was told. Got home very dizzy but I knew it was all part of it. However, the ringing and noise in my ear that I had before is now intensified since the surgery (its been 3 days now since surgery). I tried to close my other ear to see if I could hear anything and so far nothing. So the loud ringing and the fact that I cannot hear yet is worrying me. I do have the ear cannal stuffed with cotton so I guess that could prevent the sound however, shouldn't the ringing be gone or at least gotten a bit better instead of more loud now?Thanks."
"Otitis Media","I have been suffering this condition for the last sixteen months. For the first six months I received oral antibiotics from the doctor and then every month since i have had to go back and have been given ear drops and oral antibiotics, instructions were also to keep the ear dry so i bought swimmers earplugs which i use every time i wash my hair or use the shower.I recently started to get a really bad toothache and went to the dentist, I was told that there was not any tooth infection and that the possible cause was from infection in the sinus area around the tubes from my ear. I have lost some hearing in the ear and am in constant pain, I have lost time of work from this condition, I do not give in straight away but work until I cannot stand the pain and fever any longer.Does anyone know how long one needs to continue like this until a referral is made to see a consultant as I feel I am at the end of the road with this??

"Otitis Media","My partner has had an issue with her sinuses for about 8 months or so, she often gets a runny nose maybe several times a week and you will hear her sniffling. For about a week now she has complained about ear ache and dizziness , I took her to A&E on Friday and they said that her ear is cloudy which indicates an infection and gave her a medication for dizziness, the next morning she went to gp as she already had the appointment, he said same thing that her ear showed redness and cloudy which indicates an infection he gave same anti dizziness medication and some anti biotics which she been taking since Saturday morning. Now Monday evening and her sinuses are no better and her dizziness is still on and off, she told both GP and A&E about her sinus problem but they didn't seem particularly concerned, am I unnecessarily concerned ? By the way what comes from the nose is clear and she hasn't got a fever, both of which she feels are relevant in trying to get me to shut up"

"Otitis Media","So, im 14 and have had chronic ear infections since I was very young. I used to get them every 3 months, but now i get them at least 1 time a month, sometimes up to 3 in one month. I have very bad scarring on my ear drum from the infection as well as rupturing it so many times, sometimes 3-5 a year. I have monderate to severe hearing loss in both ears, so i use a hearing amplifier.I am so... fustrated. My ears are so scarred you cant see behind the ear drum (hardly) so you cant see if my bones behind the ear are erroded, making diagnosing and treating my condition hard. What can i do???"

"Otitis Media","Hello all, I have a weird problem that's been present for at least a couple of years. When I sleep on my right side, my left ear (it's in the air/facing up) gets a weird sensation and eventually a deep ache. The pain is in the middle/inner ear. I've searched and I've seen no one have the same problem as I do. If I accidentally fall asleep on that side, I wake up with pain so bad it could make me cry. Any idea on what this could be or similar experiences? I feel alone and I'm worried it's something serious.

"Otitis Media","I've been fighting mine for just under 10 weeks. Whats crazy is the way mine started. I had 2-3 nights of restless sleep. I finally realized I had a slight ringing in my ears, some slight pressure under my eyes and my ears felt slightly stopped up. I began using a saline spray to clear my sinuses. 2 days later I was at the doctor because my ears were ringing too loudly to sleep. He said he didn't see any signs of infection, but he gave me a Z-pak and some Robitussin cough syrup. I don't believe the antibiotics did anything, but the Robitussin stopped the ringing immediately. I didn't realize it then, but it has guaifenesin in it. That is all I ever needed.As I said, I didn't make that connection until too late. After the antibiotics were done, and the ringing was still comeing back, I went back to using the saline spray. That was January 12th. That is when my descent into hell began. I used it like crazy that night, along with antihistamines, steam and spray and oral decongestants.I had no idea that your ears could make noises like that. I felt like I was being tortured. After 40 hours of this I found a friend with some Xanax and managed to sleep. I have seen my GP and an ENT. There is no sign of any infections. My GP prescribed Nasonex in case there was some Eustachian tube inflammation. I used it for a week. It made my ears ring something fierce and I just couldn't take it any longer. My ears/hearing are excellent. Both doctors and my pharmacist say it is a temporary thing, but it will take time to resolve. It is absolutely insane that saline spray can cause this.I have had days where my ears were almost normal, followed by days that seemed like I had an alarm clock ringing in my brain for the entire day.At this point the spikes are not nearly as severe, but the hissing/ringing has become pretty much non-stop. Sometimes louder, sometimes less loud. I don't know if this leveling out is a good sign or not though. I can not express how badly this sucks."
"Otitis Media","Ive had this before in 2003 and now it's back. Been about 5 months now of feeling giddy and having panic type attacks. ENT consultant explained that wrong signals to brain due to inner ear damage can cause anxiety and panic attacks . The problem is that I am 55, single and childless so I have no one to discuss this with and no support and I am getting increasing housebound and fearful that I will have an attack when out. Supermarkets are a nightmare, noisy environments, too many conversations going on a once, multitasking etc all cause me problems. I work with young people and some times when they are all being really enthusiastic and talking all the time it sets me off.my closest friend is in India at the moment so I don't have anyone to talk to about this so I feel like there's no one to tell me not to worry.this forum has really helped as I can see that other people are going through the same as me with the horrible symptoms.All I wantfor christmas is good health and my life back!"
"Otitis Media","Hi all,So last Friday I stupidly attempted to clean my ears with cotton buds (it's only after I realised that it's possibly the worst thing you can do) After cleaning them, everything seemed fine until I woke up the following morning slight with loss of hearing in my left ear, it's not completely gone but it is muffled (almost as if you have water in your ear when swimming, or flying in a plane just before your ears pop)and I have a ringing sensation within my ear.im booked in with my GP in the coming days but I was just wondering if anybody can give any possible indications what it may be.Kind Regards,"

"Otitis Media","I'm a 14 year old female who was diagnosed with Otosclerosis. If I have mild hearing loss in my left ear how long do you think it will take for me to go competely deaf in one ear? and also a stapedectomy was reccomened as a surgical treatment if I wanted it by my ENT specialist. She told me that it would only last about 20 years on everage (the prosthetic stapes) . Should I get this sugery in my prime when my hearing isnt that bad (20's and 30's)? Or do you think I should refrain and get it later on? I just dont want to get one, then a medical breakthough happens but since ive had a stapedectomy I cant have the treatment that can fix/cure it."
"Otitis Media","So I have had symptoms for around 5 years but nothing too bothering, basically my left ear isn't as near as strong as my right ear.My hearing in my left ear isn't as strong as my right and makes bizarre noises on a day to day basis but has lately gotten a lot worse.While running for the example, my ear makes a 'thumping nosie' but I can't actually feel anything moving.When straining lifting/moving things my ear makes an almighty 'swoosh' noise.The worst one, which has started recently over the past few months is now happening every night, when lying on my bad ear, if I wake up in the middle of the night when I breathe in my ear also feels like it's breathing and also makes very very fast popping noises, as if air is escaping (popping very fast) out at a high pitch and then also air escaping out still popping fast as I breathe back out again.This makes it uncomfortable for me to sleep as I can only lie on one side when it starts.I get no pain, which in thankful for but its just aggravating and it's sometimes hard to hear people when facing one way.But this fast popping air noise is what's making me worried now, has anyone else had or heard anything like this?Sorry about the big paragraph but it's the best Ivan describe it.Also when cleaning my ears out the left feels a lot tighter inside then my right.Thanks everyone"

"Otitis Media","I've had a cold for the past few days, and today suddenly my right ear became blocked. So I tried to unblock it asap by holding my nose closed and then trying to exhale through it (this usually fixes it for me on planes etc) however the pop happened but my ear was still blocked, and it began hurting straight away. The pain has been here for hours now, I tried to pop it at about 12PM and it's now 8PM.Not sure what to do, is there any remedies I can try to try and unblock my ear? It's from a cold as far as I'm aware as I've been blowing my nose hard past few days, and now it really hurts and I sort of feel dizzy."
"Otitis Media","Ive always had quite bad tinnitus in both ears but lately I've been having a very slight sudden loss of hearing which lasts for a second or two then goes back to normal. It's kind of the same thing where your ears pop on the plane, I've read stuff about sudden hearing loss which lasts longer and is much more intense but not sure if that's the same as I've got? Is mine just a more advanced form of tinnitus? I went to the doctors recentley and she asked if I had any hearing loss where I mentioned, checked the inside of my ears but didn't say much... Thanks"
"Otitis Media","Hi,I have tried a number of traditional methods to sort my ear issues, and I was wondering if the fantastic forum members had any creative ideas for me. Getting quite desperate now!

Disorientated feeling every morningI have seen plenty of ENT doctors over the years and tried to do some research online. I am currently seeing a specialist at Addenbrookes hospital [Cambridge, UK], and they have been asking me to try a number of things over the last few years.

"Otitis Media","Hi allI have been diagnosed with otosclerosis about 5 years ago, I am now in my early 30s. My right ear is quite bad, I can't use it to speak on the phone and I always have to place myself in meeting rooms / social occasions so that people stand on my left side, otherwise I can't hear. I had an appointment at the RNTNE hospital in Kings Cross London yesterday and decided to go ahead with a stapedectomy, it is going to be performed by Mr Lavy or someone in his team. Apparently they do about 60 a year. I am quite scared about the ""1%"" risk of total hearing loss and wondering if there is anybody unfortunate enough who had this happened. I can't really imagine what life would be like with total hearing loss in one ear especially if the other ear is going to get worse in time. However if there is a 95% chance of improvement (which I understand is their current success rate) I am willing to risk it. Has anyone had a stapedectomy at the RNTNE before, what was it like?Best of luck to all[i:3965c1cfc0]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:3965c1cfc0]"

"Otitis Media","Hi! Does anybody know if Otitis Externa can be the cause of neck and face numbness / tightening? In other words, can it affect the nerves in the face? I'm quite scared. I was diagnosed 2 days ago with Otitis Externa and I was prescribed Amoxicilin antibiotics (500mg every 8 hours for 7 days). I was also told to take 1gram of paracetamol every 8 hours.Aside from some ear discomfort and various aches around my head, I hadn't been feeling too bad. But a few hours ago, I started to experience pain/tightening at the back of my neck, and then a similar numbness sensation predominantly on the left side of my face in different places. It seemed to come on quite quickly, and includes a tightening feeling on the side of my face, a little on the top of my head, and now I seem to have a constant tight feeling on the medium left part of my neck. I still have a slight discomfort in my ears, but I really don't know if this is all related... I hope it is but I'm wondering if anyone has ever experienced anything similar as a result of Otitis Externa? I doubt it is a reaction to the antibiotic because I have used it various times in the past without problems. If anyone could suggest anything, please let me know. Thanks. "

"Otitis Media","I have had ear pain dating back to January of 2014. It all started with an ear ear infection. I was initially given the usual ear infection medication (amoxcillian) which didn't do to the trick. Predinose was prescribed afterwards and it took care of the infection but the ear pain never went away. ENTs have said my ear looks normal and the pain is being referred from somewhere else. I have seen an oral surgery for TMJ, neurologist, chiropractor, and a dentist and none of them have been able to pinpoint what it is. I have also had numerous MRIs that show nothing. Along with the ear pain, I sometimes get pain in my neck region/left shoulder. For a bit of time, I used to get back of the head headaches but those have gone away.There are two causes that I have been pointing to. When I had my wisdom teeth removed, my bottom left root was left in due to it being close to a nerve. My neurologist and oral surgeon said this wouldn't be causing ear pain, but a different oral surgeon said that it could. The risk of getting it removed is possible numbness in my lip/chin for an indefinite amount of time.The second cause that I have read about is Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (LPR). Along with my ear pain, I have a constant cough, mucus build up, and acid reflux like conditions without the burning. I don't smoke. I am seeing an ENT for this tomorrow.Any help would be appreciated. 24/M."

"Otitis Media","For the past number of years ive had a problem in my left ear, whenever listening to music or in a pub/nightclub it feels like tv static in my ear, it becomes a major problem and then feels as if my ear is closing over and can hardly hear for a brief second. It also happens if people are talking into my ear or even whispearing. Listening to the radio in the car or any noise sets it off, its worsened by singing and even yawning. It flares up sometimes but it continually happening. I have been to see an ENT specialist and he stated it was just glue ear. I have had several operations on ear for inserting grommets. I am a 22 year old male in good physical and mental health and the problem is affecting my life in a number of ways."
"Otitis Media","Hello,Just wondered if anyone has experienced any of the following ear problems? I'm a 26 year old woman who has had 9 operations on my right ear in the past 4 years. Cut the long story short, my right ear is slightly smaller than my left ear (which touchwood works perfectly). At the time of my birth, the doctors confirmed there were no abnormalities in my right ear. As I got older I had a bit of skin in my middle ear that kept growing, doctors couldn't operate on me as a child as they said it would paralyse half my face. At 20/21 years of age, I had severe chlostestomia and had surgery. The ENT removed skin and bone that had grown in my ear canal and did a reconstruction. Most of the bone in my middle ear had eroded due to the chlostestomia too. Since then I've had various operations to improve hearing, such as; a titanium implant to improve hearing, making my ear canal bigger because the ear canal keeps closing up, skin graft from my leg used in my ear to help me hear better and removing skin from behind my ear that grows keloids after operations etc. My actual eardrum is fine it's the middle ear and ear canal that are causing the problems. I was originally 90% deaf in my right ear and after the operations it increased to 60% deafness but as my ear canal attempts to close up each time, the deafness increases once more. I had 6 operations last year, 1 month apart under general anaesthetic. On my 3rd operation last year after returning to my hospital bed, I had continuous seizures for 30 minutes and my heart stopped. ENT put it down to low vitamin D and anxiety attacks. Since then, I've had seizures and severe panic attacks on several occasions, rushed to A&E on 2 occasions. After many tests, it has been confirmed that I suffer from reactive hypoglycaemia and anxiety as well. Most days I have intense fatigue, headaches, earaches in my right ear, dizziness, confused and low moods. I'm undergoing tests with a neurologist to monitor the activity in my brain too. Sorry for the long message but your help would be much appreciated. I'm starting to lose hope. J x"

Has anyone hah anything similar to this , dunno really wat to do "
"Otitis Media","I have had problems with sinus infections in my lifetime but when I went to the doctor he said my ear drum looked fine maybe a little sunk in with no signs of an infection but he gave me antibiotics just in case there was something he couldn't see. So now I'm on day 3 of the antibiotics and nothing has changed in my hearing I'm nervous that it is perminant damage and not something that is going to go away. When I hear higher pitched noises they sound almost robotic. Just wondering if anybody else had some insight on what it might be?"
"Otitis Media","Hi, I've been given an ear spray to put in my ears to reduce inflammation, but when I spray, the liquid just seems to come right out of my ears. I don't know if this is normal and if enough stays in the ear to coat the inflammation. Is this normal? I have tried putting cotton wool just at the outside of the ear, but when I remove it, I just see the liquid has soaked into the cotton wool and still hasn't stayed in the ear. Does enough of the liquid stay in the ear to be effective? Thanks!"
"Otitis Media","Over a year ago I had an incident where I was exposed to loud music and noticed inner ear pain in my left year. The next day I had horrible peircing pain and dullness. Im a music producer, I decided to take two weeks off to let my ear rest. I went to see an audiologist and 2 ENT's. They told me I had no signs of hearing loss and that my ear looked ok. Their edvice was to keep the volume down and that I aggrivated my ear drum, and im lucky its not worse. Over the next 10 months I noticed I was sensitive to loud-very loud music 90db+. I work long hours infront of speakers but im careful and it has never caused me any pain until this incident. No when I would be exposed to 90 or 100db music for even a minute I would notice pain would immediately occur in my left year. Sometimes it could take 24 hours for it go away. I noticed this started to happen more and more often. I could be sitting in a room with people listening to a song and im the only one with pain in my ear. It became a real issue when I would get headaches at night from the pain and it was effecting my job. I attended one concert and could only stay for 5 minutes and my left year was in pain (this was when I thought my ear had ""healed). About 2 months ago I went to see another ENT. They saw no issues with my ear at all and I had a hearing test. No hearing loss. They did an MRI on me and that also came back normal. Im continuing to deal with this ear pain on a daily basis. I took 3 weeks off from music/loud environments and my ear was fine. But when I got back to work after the holiday I immediately started to experience pain in my ear. Im 26 and have been producing for over 10 years. Never have had this time of pain. Even from lower volumes at long periods of time. Always the left ear. Im worried not only because I can't get answers but how to stop this pain. And to make sure im not causing long term damage. Any information or people with similar issues would be so much appreciated! Thanks"
"Otitis Media","Hi allI have been dealing with constant lightheadedness and a blocked right ear for 6 weeks now. My left ear has also unblocked and blocked uo again twice. I have been to the doctor a number of times and even saw the ENT who told me I have nasal congestion/inflammation and it would take time to go away. I also had an allergy test but it came up negative. Mri was also negative. I went to the doctor again recently and he thinks it is more so from an infection and now I am on antibiotics. Some days I feel better than others and some days I feel a lot worse and very woozy and dizzy. It has been so many weeks now..I have been off work and I can barely leave the house most days. Has anyone had these symptoms? How long did they last? I've heard so many things now I don't know what to think..I have people around me for support but it's hard for them to understand. Feel like I'm in a prison world .."
"Otitis Media","Hi...I have had blocked ears for nearly 2 weeks now and even though i was prescribed steroid drops its still not clearing...they are muffled with a droning noise which is very annoying...I have had chronic sinitus for a few years now and think it may be related but its so annoying and cannot hear properly...any one else experience similar as Its driving me mad and wondering will it eventually clear itself...thanks for any advice that might reassure me"
"Otitis Media","6 episodes, 2 hospital admissions and twice weekly trips to ENT Dressings and I have found only 2 thing that go a little way towards alleviating this horrible condition - although I am still in the process of sorting it out...!Where TAC cream is used (either on wick or by injection), the old wives remedy of 'Ip Glyp' helps alleviate inflammation and heat - particularly in the exterior part of the ear. Ask at ENT if you've never had this before.I also found that on a recent visit to Italy, a visit to the Pharmacy (no prescription was required), 8 Euros and 48 hours later, I administered an anti bacterial, anti fungal, steriodal cream / drops found there which totally cleared up the episode, without returning to the UK!Given this, I am planning a return visit to Europe for this purpose to get it sorted again."
"Otitis Media","Hello,I have the ability to activate the rumbling sound( almost exactly what you hear when kylo ren was using the force in the new star wars movie) and i can make the clicking sound in your ear when you yawn or swallow to open your ears myself without yawning or swallowing. i use the clicking sound in combination with breathing inwards with my nose to close my ears and breathing outwards with nose or mouth to open them. Yesterday i used the closing alot because of the loud firework bombs in the area and i didnt get any ringing of damaged hairs in the ear but just now i put my finger to my ear and felt a hard thing, so i though it was some of the white/yellow ear stuff but when i looked at it it was a crust of a wound, and i also have it on the same place on my right ear. It is in sortof the top area of the ear, if you go from top to bottom of your ear you first feel a big open space, make your finger go to the right(if it is your right ear, left for left ear) until you reach the end of the ear, then folow the curve down and stop, thats the area i mean, thats where they are, just above the actual ear hole. Does anyone know what this means?Thanks in advance  -Pim"
"Otitis Media","So for the past 3 years my wife has had the following problems. Mucus that drains from her nose and down her throat. It's very bad the second she wakes up. This fluid seems to travel down to her stomach causing awful pains and noise. She usually throws up in the morning. This mucus sticks in her throat all day. She is constantly clearing her throat but it never goes away. Her hearing is fine from tests performed by an ENT but she always hears static and pressure like she's in a pressurized cabin. I think she has a wicked inner ear infection. The ENT said she doesn't but he's only looked in her ear and can't see past the drum. She's also had an endoscopy with no findings except irritation in her throat. She's had blood work done, allergy tests, and a breath test. Now the ENT has her scheduled to have some tube put up her nose to monitor her stomach for a few days. I feel like this is another complete waste of time and effort. Does anyone have any thoughts? Maybe I'm leaning toward the wrong direction. Does anyone know who to get an ENT to perform tests for inner ear infections?Please help!!!!!'"

"Otitis Media","Hello everyone.Here is my problem. It all happened on Thanksgiving night when I went to sleep on that day. When I woke up the following morning I could not hear 100% out of my left ear. In my own opinion the only two things that could have caused the hearing loss is because I was laying on my left ear with my hands cupped on them the WHOLE NIGHT, so I was sleeping sideways the entire night (because it was cold too). I sleep stuck in one spot because it got so freezing cold. I was also crying during the night (personal reasons). And as I was crying I did notice that the droplets from my tears dripped into my ear possibly. I had so much tears, it was a flood. My face was sticky, my elbows were sticky, my cheeks, the tear flew down the side of my face. So this is ALL happening while I'm laying on my side with my hand cupped to my ear. Also I didn't lose my hearing while all that was happening. The loss of hearing, happened when I woke up. And it might have happened somewhere in the middle of the night until I woke up...My ears feel TERRIBLE. This is the 2nd day and out of 100% I can hear maybe 10% only. I took shower yesterday and thought the steam would help but no it did not. A little bit of water got in. I also used DEBROX yesterday too, because I was thinking maybe it's ear wax that I unintentionally jammed in while my hand was plastered directly on my left ear laying sideways the entire night. I also put a little bit of baby oil in my ear yesterday, not in drops more like rubbed the oil with a Q-tip and carefully rubbed the outer ear, hoping the oil would go in on it's own.This morning I woke up and I was still pretty deaf, and became even MORE deaf after using Debrox again....it's clogged my ear even more.Anyone know how to get my hearing back?? Nothing is working other than TIME. I noticed that at some point yesterday and today that just for a few seconds/minutes -the hearing goes up like 2 %or 3 % where I can hear just a whisper, but then goes back to being completely blocked.Also my ears DON'T HURT. I can swallow, I can yawn, eat. It only hurts when I put too much liquid in it like (water or Debrox) and rub it around. Or if I poke the inside of my ear with my pinky and play around with my ear, or tug at my ear lobes to much...it starts to get sore. The only thing that can cause a little pain is when I blow my nose hard, or sneeze. Then it feel like there's fullness in the ear.Lastly I just don't see how it could be an infection, or fluid behind my eardurm type thing. Both ears were working just find until after Thanksgiving night. The only liquid that went in my ear was a bit of shower water, and Debrox drops that's it.I almost fee like my eardrum is bent or something from laying on it the whole night....but honestly I don't know what is going on???And I'm very scared. I CAN'T GO to a Doctors or an ENT...I don't have a job right now, and I'm broke. Which is why I'm on a forum seeking help. Maybe next year I can afford to pay out of the pocket to see a nurse at Wallgreens for an ear clean out but until then I have to stick with remedies. My best luck is giving it time. I had EXTREME swimmers ear early last year...but that went away on it's own....Any ideas, remedies? Has anyone ever had severe hearing loss but left it alone, and it the hearing came back? I just can't believe my hearing could be gone -when I didn't do anything to it....other than laying on it??"
"Otitis Media","hey all. I am pleased to join this group. Best wishes to all who are healing through their ailments. Mine is very minor compared to some i know but i have been recently down played by an ENT. He didn't see any ear fluid in my right ear which has been plaguing me for months on end. My GP saw it, and even the ENT's own audiologist saw it! I was left feeling embarrassed and furious. Is this normal to have a continuous swelling in the ear every morning since Marchwhen you get up? I don't think it is. I know fluid can be in the ear for some time, but he said my ear drums were fine. It's that weird squishy swimming pool feeling i get and the fact that my ear drum finally let the fluid out on its own but keeps coming back. This morning it has come back with a vengeance, and there has been some mild facial numbing. It seems to begetting worse in filling up in there. He didn't order (After sleuthing around the internet i found out about some of these tests) EcochG or ABR or MRI or CT Scan to determine if there was ear fluid, because my eardrums are screwed from surgery with scarring.He claimed it was jaw issues and just walked away. Nor did he offer to knock back the ear tissue which he claimed wereSOOO thickto give any relief. Am i just imagining things or did i get brushed aside like i wasn't worth his time? My left ear is perfectly fine. Claimed my dizzy spells due to a previous ear infection in Marchwere migranes. I knew someone who suffered terrible migranes and those weren't it. I now have a lump behind my right ear where all the issues are, about the size of a blue berry, or as the GP nurse's said bigger. It is hard and won't move. It is not a pimple because it has been there since July 20th and would've popped by now. You have to lift the ear bowl to feel it as it is just underneath there. My hair dresser touched it as i warned her that it was there because sometimes she pokes me. I have no idea what to do now. Sorry to vent on here, i am just mad thatthere wasn't anything wrong when there was. We're waiting on another ENT. Has anyone on here had thick eardrums and stlll have ear tubes placed in? Sorry to ask, just curious,"
"Otitis Media","Hello,Ive had ongoing problems with my ears for about 15years. Whenever I swallow, talk or move my jaw, my ears pop, making hearing bad & when I talk makes me sound super loud. I do the technique to try and equalise my pressure. I read that people, hold their nose and blow out to pop them (open up the tubes). Ive read the technique people use however none ever mention the next bit I have to do. I have to do this and then somehow suck in to get the pressure back to what it should be, as the nip and blowing pops my ears more and leaves the dulled hearing, with ears must be full of air. I have to go through the same process pretty much every few seconds to equalise. Whenever I get a cold its the first thing that goes crazy and cant sort it. Got lots of pressure in my head at the moment too.Ive mentioned it the doctors before. Is there any real way to solve this.I do suffer congestion, at the moment ive gota nasal spray from the pharmacy and also paracetamol decongestant tablets. As the last couple of weeks ive been very deaf. In one side I cant hear anything or alter that pressure like I can normally. I just have a buzzing noise constantly. I did lose hearing in my good ear, as after my doctors visit ,said one thats deaf has a lot of wax so getting syringed, I made things worse when I put drops in the good one and lost that one too, Luckily that ones come back. Ive been having these hearing problems for 2weeks. Hopefully I get sorted tomorrow when syringed. But the whole pressure thing, Can I do anything?"
"Otitis Media","hi over the past few weeks I have noticed a very high pitched buzz in my ears any ideas what it could be"
"Otitis Media","Hi, for the past 2 weeks i've been getting bad ear pain and throat pain. My nose has been stuffed up aswell for a while. I went to my primary doctor and she said i have a nose polyp but i don't think that causes throat and ear pain. I'm in really bad pain and on top of that i keep getting anxeity attacks cause i think i got something serious like cancer idk if i do. I've been missing alot of school cause of this and i just want it to stop. Another thing i goto see an ENT on the 20th. But intill then Can someone please help me? I don't know what to do the pain is horrible. I wake up with ringing in one side of my ear and soreness in one side of my throat. Sometimes i get a headache from it. Also it feels like something is stuck in my throat alot. Can anyone give me any suggestions or help me with this? Anyone know what this possibly can be?"
"Otitis Media","Hi EveryoneMy name is Nadeem I am 41 years old and an Electrician by trade, I have developed tinnitus like symptoms in my left ear about January 2015. Initially I thought it might be just a wax or my work related noises might be causing this and ignored it for a few weeks than just home remedies as I am generally quite fit and well and look after myself and try not to bother GPs. But in this instance no difference in my ear so booked an appointment with gp he checked throughly and advised no wax no infections etc so reffered me to ent specialist. Got an appointment in another few weeks time. He did hearing test b4 I see him than slight deterioration in left ear but been told try to live with it as there's nothing in my ear but he asked me if he how if I send you for an MRI scan but everyone I sent so far for this problem there was nothing in their MRI results but I will send you anyway.we are now in July when I got my 1st MRI scan and after 2 weeks of that scan I received another letter to come back for another MRI with dye injection. Went again and after a month or so received a letter from same ENT to cone and see me. We are now end of September and he delivered the news that it is Acoustic Neuroma it's a small one approx 13mm by 7mm.He explained the course of treatment but a team of specialists at Leeds General Infermiry will decide that. Only last week I have received an appointment for 11/01 2016 to see a specialist at LGI.Any advise will be extremely helpful from previous patients or professionals as if I were to given choice between Gemma Knife and a surgery which one should I take bearing in mind ENT also mentioned that specialist might decide to leave it and monitor it for a few years because it is very slow growing but ultimate decion will be there's.help plz.thanks for reading,Nadeem"
"Otitis Media","So for the past three months off and on I have had a fullness feeling in my right ear and sometimes both. It comes and goes and sometimes it comes with some minor pain. Went to the doc 2 months ago and he told me to use Flonase which has not worked at all. Anyone else have this issue and I should note that the last three days I have had some throat irritation."
"Otitis Media","A rapid thumping started in my left ear three weeks ago and was on and off for the first three days. By the third day, it was constant and although I felt no pain it was almost inpossible to ignore making sleeping so incredibly difficult. I Visited a clinic after a week and was told it had something to do with my sinuses and was prescribed a steroid nasal spray to use for a week. After a few days the thumping went away. I continued to use the spray for a whole week but lowered the dosage. The thumping went away for a full week but then came back on Tuesday! Went to the Gp and was given a different milder nasal spray and was told a referral could take weeks.I discovered that if I steam my face for about 15 mins the thumping goes away for an hour or two but this doesn't always work. What can I do to make it go away, I can't stand it anymore."
"Otitis Media","Hi,I have many problems with my ears but I thought I should make little in-roads and that is why I am posting this discussion.I tend to get ear wax build ups very quickly and have had my ears syringed mulitple times in the last few years.

"Otitis Media","I was diagnosed a few months ago with glue ear and was told it usually clears up in about 3 months but it hasn't. Bought an otovent but that made no difference whatsoever. Went back to the GP and was referred to an audiologist who I saw today. He checked my ear and my hearing and said that I don't have glue ear as if I did the ear drum wouldn't move the way it did when he used some instrument in it plus he said the hearing was fine.But I still have this feeling of my ear being blocked and also a pain in it and down into my jaw. Anyone else had anything like this? Getting really fed up with it now"
"Otitis Media","Hi, I have bilateral Otoscelerosis for the past 5 years. I have been offered Stapedectomy surgery at RSCH, Guildford. Have anyone done Stapedectomy there?"
"Otitis Media","My ears have been severely throbbing to the point where I put my hand behind them in feels like my hand over my heart like heart palpitations I felt a ball like mass above that left ear on temple leak and felt the fluids go through tubes and another big sac in the middle of my head and hot liquid pour down my back and neck and felt like tubed were expanding and nerve in. Cheek on same side hurting and jaw twitvh when I touch it my zpak didn't work and my ear being cleaned didn't help i went to sleep and the throbbing pulsating ball woke me up"
"Otitis Media","I'll start from the beginning. Of May 2015, I was experiencing sensitivity of my ear. noises in general wouldn't be loud but certain noises would hurt my ear. I would be playing my guitar, students talking in class, dog barking and my ear would hurt. Basically anything somewhat loud or high pitch( happening to my right ear). Sometimes my ear would hurt at random( both ears mostly right). My left ear would twitch non stop as well. It then stopped and I felt better. Of mid July is started again. My left ear started to become sensitive. Twitching stop, but the ear sensitivity was bothering me. Then I started to develop ringing and lot of ear pain in both ears. I went to the ENT twice but by the time I had the appointment the sensitivity went away. He Doctor said it was tmj, but I'm not sure about that. Ive never had jaw pain.The ringing went away for about 1 week but then came back, so it's been lasting for about 2 and a half months( the ringing). The ringing sound like when you turn on an old box tv. Finally, it's October and I still have the ringing and sometimes pain in my ears. Can anyone relate or help?"

"Otitis Media","i am getting over a cold and my ears are blocked. How can I unblock them? I have tried yawning, chewing, swallowing water but they've been like this all day."
"Otitis Media","A couple of months ago I suddenly lost my hearing in my left ear for around 4 days, my hearing came back but since I lost my hearing I have experienced constant tiniitus. I used to experience simple fungal infections in my left earover the yearsand used castenen drops to clear it which worked. However this tinnitus has obviously come from the hearing loss. I have no pain, I have seen GP's and ENT's and they dont seem to be keen to have a good discussion and want to get to the root cause. I have taken anti biotics, seroids, ear sprays to no avail. I have started taking ginko and magnesium, zinc supplements. I am due to have an MRI in a few weeks but will that tell me anything other than if it is a tumour. My ears seem full but not blocked and there is no discharge from my left ear since the tinnitus started but before I used to get loads of discharge. Also when I wiggle my finger in my left ear it sounds different pitch and more echoey that my good right ear, any suggestions?"
"Otitis Media","I have had MRI and CT scans which fortunately show no other problem. The tinnitus was brought on following an ear-infection upon returning on a long haul flight. I have now seen an audiologist who has given me a masker and sleep pillow speaker. The sleep pillow speaker works well but at the moment I am not sure if I am getting any benefit from the ear masker. The noise I experience is a white noise. Like the sound of a lap top battery. It is non stop 24 hrs a day. I seem to be able to get through the day without too much problem so long as I keep busy and have background music on or getting out and about so you have natural noises around you. The worse time is sitting down in the evening to watch television. I seem to compete with the television with the noise trying to outdo the TV. Going to bed is a lot easier with the pillow speaker as this distracts from the quietness. I would very much appreciate to hear from anyone experiencing the same problem and their thoughts of how to cope."
"Otitis Media","My aunt, my mother, their mother (my grandmother), and I all seem to have the same hearing dissability and none of us have a clue what it is or what can be done about it. I can't find any similarities to our problem on any forum.I have a terrible time understanding people who are talking if there is the slightest background noise. I also have tinnitus which I have learned to accept and deal with. I went to a hearing aid specialist today who performed a typical hearing test. My results are far better than anybody in my similar age group. In fact, being in my mid-forties, I performed far better than many 20 year olds. I can hear a pin drop in the next room, but I have a terrible time hearing people speak clearly. Add the smallest amount of background noise and my ability to understand what is being said becomes a severe problem. The best way I can describe this is blurred, garbled, or distorted hearing. The doctor thinks that I was just there to get a free hearing test. I am serious that this is a huge problem for my relatives and I. I was hoping that a hearing aid would help me, but they said it won't help at all, and could make things sound worse.What is going on? This condition has very gradually worsened over the past 20-30 years or so, and people keep saying that I have selective hearing. I am becoming very good at understanding people if I focus on their lips, but if they turn around I often lose what they say to me. If it is perfectly silent when they are talking I don't seem to have as much of a problem understanding the person."
"Otitis Media","Hi all,In February 2014, I blew my nose very heavily after a sudden sneezing fit, and a week later (whether related or not), I woke up in the night with high pitched tinnitus in one ear.The tinnitus (pitched) lasted about 4 or 5 days, and I could only hear it at night, but it has persisted in various forms since. For the first few months, it was an infrequent, pulsing (not in time with my heartbeat) high pitch, but over the past year it has been a far less distracting muffled hiss.I went to my doctors who said ""it's tinnitus, nothing we can do"". That really annoyed me. I then went again, and had an ear wax clean with syringe, which cleaned my ears but didn't do much else. I went a third time, and he said my eardrum was bulging because I had fluid behind it, but that it would go. That was 12 months ago.I finally asked to see an ENT, who basically was useless and gave me a leaflet on tinnitus and sent me away. I know it's tinnitus (to a degree), but I want to know what's behind it!I'm pleased to say that the symptoms, by and large, have been getting VERY slowly better since then, with the help of Beconase spray which was suggested by another doctor I asked to see for a second opinion.I've only taken it on and off for a week or so at a time, but after doing some research, I see that they recommend 6 weeks of use for maximum impact.I'm into week 3 of this now, but unfortunately, an annoying symptom from last year has returned. The hissing has almost completely subsided, but I've got this low humming sound like a fridge or car parked outside. The last time I had this symptom was in November 2014, so it's annoying that it's come back. So frustrating. I seem to lose one symptom, and another appears.I like to think I'm on the road to recovery, but it's very annoying. Any thoughts?To clarify, my symptoms since March 2014 as follows:* Ringing in ears (infrequent nowadays, but had a bad few nights last week. Cannot hear during day. Does not affect sleep)* Low, growling sound in ears (November 2014 and present. Seems to fluctuate during the day. Was there when I started writing this post, but seems to be calming down now)* Hissing in ears. (Not loud enough to really upset me, even at night, but it's there and it's annoying)Things I DON'T have, which ETD can cause:* Dizziness* Pain* Loss of hearing (I went for a hearing test at ENT, and it came back absolutely perfect)So any ideas on a) what I have and b) what I can do to help rid of it for good? I can live with it, but I'd rather get rid of it."
"Otitis Media","I've been getting muffled hearing and ring constantly for these past years and it could last up to 5 days or 3 days if I'm lucky. I'm 22. I've notice when I finish having sex/masurbate I get ringing in the ear coming up slowly and then muffled afterward. Another thing I've notice the deeper the muffled hearing is the louder the ringing is. Sometime when I feel hot (redness in cheeks) while lying down on my bed it also occurs then?"
"Otitis Media","I have now had tinnitus for 9 months. I have had mri and ct which confirmed that there is nothing else untoward which is obviously good. I am struggling to cope with this. During the day it's not too bad because i am busy, but when trying to relax and watch TV it seems to compete. At night i now have to use a pillow speaker which does help. My real worry is how it will affect me as i get older and become less active. I have been referred for counselling but find the idea a bit distressing as i am usually the listener. Does anyone else feel the same and how do you cope."
"Otitis Media","I've been suffering from this problem for well over a year. I've visited 2 different ENT doctors in the past 6 months. In both cases I was given a hearing and pressure test and told categorically that I have ""amazing"" hearing in both ears. I actually got told today they rarely see results as good as mine. This is part of what makes this so frustrating.I experience 2 issues:1. Things sound quieter/duller to my right ear.2. I feel a constant pressure in my right ear, a simple swallow or nose hold will clear the pressure but only for half a second and then it returns.I've been told that:- I have pefectly normal and well functioning eustachian tubes- No wax build blocking anything- No issues with the ear drums- No sign of anything under the drum or infection- That I have identical ability to hear in both earsHas anyone ever run into something like this? I don't know where to turn. The main thing that's annoying is the constant feeling of pressure and needing to clear my right ear.The dullness of sound in my right ear is so easy for me to detect for example when I'm on a phone call I can move the phone between ears and the clarity and volume when the phone is at my left ear vs my right ear is noticably different. Yet apparently the tests say I have exactly the same hearing ability in both ears!Could this all be in my head? Is my brain simply choosing to amplify the sound it's getting from my left ear even though the right ear is perfectly capable? I'm clutching at straws here!"
"Otitis Media","I have the sensation of a blocked right ear. When I speak I can hear my own voice in my right ear, which is really frustrating.That is until I tilt my head forward ( I discovered this whilst doing the ironing)! When I speak with my head tilted forward and chin towards my chest it seems to clear ! How strange, does anyone have any thoughts on this ? Also I have a lot of congestion in my throat, could this be the cause ? If nothing else I know it helps when I'm ironing !! Any advice greatly appreciated "
"Otitis Media","Hello Everyone,I went to my doctors last Wednesday and was told i have a severe ear infection, this is causing hearing loss in my right ear, pain upto my cheek, pain down my neck, its VERY tender to touch, in fact i cant touch it. The GP gave me maxicillian? Antibotics but no pain relief. Nearly a week on and the antibotics do not seem to have touched it, but the PAIN is unbearable! it constantly throbs with pain, i cant explain it, i also get sharp shooting pains through my ear canel and down my neck. I am having many sleepless nights because of this dreadful pain! it is also weeping GREEN goo.I attended the urgent care centre (walk in centre) and they told me they couldnt do anything until i finshed my course of antibiotics but advisedme to take Ibruprefen and co codimol (together) along with my maxicillian. I know this is what the doctor has advised but taking so many drugs scare me a little. The doctor there aso didnt tell me how many to take and what mg. I have in the house 400g inbrufen tables and 8/500g co codimol - are these two ok to take together or is it too much? is it safe?im so scared that my ear is going to burst, i am in ears with the pain and i just do not know what to do with myself Also, does anyone know if i am on the wrong antibiotics? somoene told me maxicillian is very low?Thank you so much - from a very worried patient."
"Otitis Media","I've had this problem now for nearly a year. I am under an ENT doctor who has been very good, but doesn't know what it's caused by. It's not fluid so I can't have a gromit. I've had an MRI which showed nothing. I take nasal sprays and sinus rinses which don't help. I'm at the end of my tether, does anyone have any idea on what this could be and how I can get rid of it please ???"
"Otitis Media","With my story I hope I can be of help to others, and hopefully I may receive some wisdom too! When I was 13 I had a Radical Mastoidectomy. 9 years of ongoing ear infections since I was 4 years old had let to this (and I was left for far too long). The surgeon said to my Gran it was the worst case he had ever seen. I recall last few months before surgery of this daily foul smelling discharge. I had a Cholesteatoma and was so far gone I had a abscess on my Sternocleidomastoid Muscle. I had a second Mastoidectomy 7 years later, but despite having frequent re-occurring ear infections I had my third Mastoidectomy and widening of the ear canal (Meatoplasty) 3 years later. Now to prevent ear infections I have to keep my ear totally dry, and have to have microsuction every 3 months (if it is left 6 months it gets infected). So we have a lid on infection! I sometimes get facial nerve pain so bad all down one side of my face including behind my eye I have to take Tramadol. I understand after my second operation my facial nerve was exposed, and was warned about possible paralysis prior to my third operation. I was lucky in respect to that. I now see an Osteopath for neck, back of head, upper back problems, which I am convinced is a complication of my Mastoid problems (my entire Mastoid bone was taken away, so one wonders what on earth is my Sternocleidomastoid muscle is now holding onto). The side of my Mastoid disease my shoulder is lower than the other and I get an immense amount of pain in that shoulder and have been diagnosed with subacromial impingement syndrome in that shoulder, I have less range of movement in my neck to one side, get lots of upper trapezius pain, especially when carrying shopping for example. I have also the past 4 years suffered from incredible tension headaches. Any other Mastoid patient out there having muscular pain, stiffness in their neck, upper back, shoulder(s)? I also have 2 other syndromes which are very debilitating yet not completely recognised by the medical profession, which is a shame! Feel free to ask me any questions or impart any knowledge yourself! Big Love xXx"
"Otitis Media","I know this sounds weird but wondering if anyone else experiences this:When I share something deeply personal or get vulnerable in a conversation or share something close to my heart, my right ear kind of pulsates or shakes inside. It's like a brief little drumming inside my ear. Sometimes that actually confirms for me ""oh I must be saying something really important to me"". Does anyone else experience this? Thanks!"
"Otitis Media","I'm a 22 year old male and I've had ear problems for much of my life (mostly earwax buildup and lots of ear infections when I was younger). I haven't had an ear infection in a very long time, but about 9 months ago (the date is fuzzy, it could be anywhere from 7 to 11 months) I tried using an earwax irrigation kit to get out what I thought was just another blockage of earwax. Well, there was some earwax, but my ear continued to have reduced hearing and it felt like my ear was full, despite the subsequent ear drops not fizzing (indicating there was no earwax left). I figured there was water behind my ear and decided to tough it out and let it go its course. The feeling of fullness never went away. There was no pain, or very little (the initial pain being caused by irritating the eardrum with the water syringe).About 2 months ago I went to see a nurse about my ear troubles and she diagnosed me with an ear infection and prescribed amoxicillin. I told her I had ear pain, but in hindsight this was likely due to constantly holding my nose and blowing to try to equalize the pressure in my ear that day, so I probably didn't have an ear infection. Furthering my assumptions, the amoxicillin did nothing.I suppose I didn't see someone earlier because I have constantly battled with ear wax buildup my whole life and my hearing varies from month to month, so the loss of hearing wasn't as profound of a difference from my average state.My ear is still at the same level of diminished hearing (I can't exactly put a number to it because I can't really remember what good hearing sounds like, but if I had to, I'd say it's at about 50-70%), and there's still no pain.According to what I've researched, my options are to have the grommet surgery (which I'd really like to avoid, as I'm very anxious about the idea of poking a hole in my eardrum and what consequences it might have), wait it out (which I'm very much losing faith in), or as I've very recently learned, the balloon technique.At this point, my biggest concern is permanent hearing loss. I've dealt with the hearing impairment for a long time now, and it's nothing but an annoyance, but it can't be good to have this stuff stuck in my ear for many months at a time, and I'm afraid of it causing irreparable damage."
"Otitis Media","My 6 month old has a diagnosis of sensori-neural hearing loss and recently was diagnosed with allergies to cows milk and egg whites. Could there be a link between the two?"
"Otitis Media","Everytime I research anything to do with glue ear it always refers to children. So I am here for answers. I am 23years old and I have in recent weeks lost nearly 50% of my hearing due to glue ear. I suffered with glue ear as a child and had 2 sets of gromits, aidinoids and tonsils removed. I havnt suffered with bad ears for 10 years. Now its worse than ever! At work in the office I cannot hear if anyone is talking to me. What can I do? Another set of gromits would help but is there anything more permenant for an adult that could help? I would also love to know why at 23 I am still getting something I should have grown out of years ago.Many Thanks, Abbie."
"Otitis Media","A few weeks ago my ear was impacted with wax, I did have a thread on it. The doctor gave me drops which cleared it but a few mornings after it cleared I was still waking up as if my ear was glued shut, this would clear once I was up and about.Anyway we are now a week later and the ear that was blocked is itchy and there seems to be a yellowy/White/clear stuff in there and it smells a bit off (really sorry tmi)My wax is normally orangey coloured and the other ear is still normal just this one, I wouldn't say I'm in a lot of pain but my face, jaw and neck feel strange on that side still and I'm getting sharp pains from time to time In that ear but again nothing significant I just wondered if anyone else had had anything like this?"
"Otitis Media","I went to my dentist today and he said I might have TMJ. I have alot of problems and this has been bothering me for a year to the point where I have depression and anxiety. Some of you may know my story but to make this short .... Last year, my left ear makes a popping noise when I go to sleep or laying down, same thing. This has not stopped since. Then I started getting other symptoms .. ear pressure, both ears makes a clicking, popping sound when I move my jaw or swallow. I also need to wear ear plugs when having a shower or bath. NOW ... last month, I have tinnitus. It started in my right ear. Humming, low noise for a couple of weeks. Then it started in my left ear as well. Both ears. I hear humming, loud noise 24 hours and it is very upsetting. I already seen an ENT last year and he was so rude. I will see another one soon for a second opinion. Back to TMJ ... He wants to remove my 4 impacted widsom teeth and make a guard since apparently I grind my teeth. Could this help remove any of my symptoms? I'd like to hear any opinions, advice or experiences with TMJ or something related. Please help. Thank you"
"Otitis Media","I got a bad cold several months ago and developed fluid in both of my ears. My ears felt clogged and they crackled. some of the clogged sensation went away, but the crackling remains.

"Otitis Media","Hi All, since Decemberish last year I have had a small lump behind my ear and I get pain in my neck, next to the muscle near my pulse, its not always there but I feel it when it does turn up and it is a daily thing. sometimes I am aware of it more than others. I have been to the docs who didnt feel the lump was there but I know my ears and I know its there and It annoyed me he couldnt feel it. It gives me ear pain sometimes, deep in my ear. bit its my neck that hurts more. What could this be would anyone have an idea. Antibiotics and ear drops have not helped. I am currently being treated for 2 DVTs in my calf but have only recently since June been diagnosed with that. Any help please?? Thankyou peeps."
"Otitis Media","I am unable to have an MRI due to a nerve stimulator . I had a clear CT scan in January but my symptoms have got worse. 2 months ago I woke with no hearing in one ear, the hearing has slowly come back but still feels blocked. Doctor says my ears are fine when he looks. I have awful noises in that same ear now, especially at night in bed, it can sound like a fax machine to a throbbing base sound . I have high blood pressure and horrible headaches and neck aches. Tired all the time and just want to sleep. I have my eyes checked and this was also clear. If anybody could share their symptoms and stories I would be grateful "
"Otitis Media","My right ear is blocked and it's driving me mad. I have LPR (acid reflux) which may cause it as well as post nasal drip. I have seen ENT and they say is a blocked Eustacian tube.

When I hold my nose and blow the sound coming from the left ear is like a badly tuned radio noise - and people around me can hear it. I assumed it was an infection - but the really strange thing is that I have no pain whatsoever! When I wake in the mornings the ear is all caked up.Any ideas what could be going on? About 6 months ago I had the same ear syringed as I it was blocked with wax but that is the only problem I have had with it.N"

My right ear is more blocked than the left one & all I can hear is very muffled sounds. I have a constant ringing noise in my right ear but not my left.

"Otitis Media","My left ear has felt very full for the last 3 days. The ear canal is noticeably swollen and it hurts when anything hits the outside of my ear and it hurts to sleep on it. It also rings for 1-3 hours throughout the day and hurts/pulses often as well. The left side of my jaw also hurts and it is a bit painful to chew or yawn. I don't know if this is related but my throat is also irritated and I've been coughing once about every 1-2 min.I will be backpacking through Europe for the next 2 weeks (so no access to my doctor) and that involves about 4-5 airplane flights, swimming in salt water and showering in water that's not super safe to drink. Do I need to wear an ear plug while swimming/showering - because I have no idea wear to find them in Greece right now. What should I do to prevent it from getting worse/ help treat it?Side note - I had a minor ear infection in my right year about a month ago but it was milder (no jaw pain and less ringing, fullness and ear pain but my throat hurt more). My doctor gave me amoyxillin for that. I don't know if they may be related?"
"Otitis Media","I have a blood clot in ear. Have band of tightness over head. Is that normal ? I have also diagnosed with benign brain tumour . They concerned it's connected. Dr said one mass is in caverness sinus. And other in middle fossa. Another Dr said should not feel pain from ear.  So why tightness over head ? "
"Otitis Media","Alright, so for the past 4 months I have been dealing with on and off dizzines (not world spinning more like just my brain is moving its odd), tinnitus, lightheaded, eye floaters, weird vision (kind of blurry and off), depersonalization feelings, I've tried balance tests with my eyes closed and fail at only some. I've went to the doctors and he told me I have labyrinthitis and gave me antibiotics that didn't work. My anxiety has been crazy off and on. Normally what gets me is the DP, it's the most terrifying thing I have ever felt with. I went to the ENT and he told me that is not lab which makes me even more nervous now. I have a hearing test scheduled for Monday. (I have muffled hearing in my left ear along with the tinnitus). The doc did some kind of hearing test while I was there with a metal fork looking thing that makes a semi high pitched ring and for some reason my left ear (the bad one) I am freaking out that I may have acoustic neuroma. I've had two cat scans that both came back good, and still waiting for my insurance to approve my mri. Can anyone give me any advice? I have all symptoms except for Faison numbness. It's scaring me horribly and naturally is making my amxiety which makes depersonalization worse. It's a never ending cycle that I'm trying to break. The only thing that helps is ativan and sometimes just thinking about taking that gives me anxiety. "
"Otitis Media","I have a terrible pain in my left ear and the passed few days my jaw and bottom of my mouth had been aching.

"Otitis Media","Hi, have just loined group and hope I can help (group was ""Rapid thumping in right ear"" https://patient.info/forums/discuss/rapid-thumping-sound-in-right-ear-258497I have read all the posts and find this really interesting as this has just started for me. I have Bsc (psych) and my dad was an ENT ( Imiss him).This right ear thumping has recently started for me and I have tried the following1. Washing ear2. Continued popping of ears3. Using oil to maybe desolve wax (note.. used what I had which probably wasn't the best! Cooking... olive should be fine but both should achieve the result required)All of no real result.Having read all of the posts (and with a good psych degree) I have noticed that stress and anxiety seem to pop up more often than other issues such as tinitus. To have a thumping like this in the ear (especially the right ear for some strange reason) seems somewhat odd to say the least. Note: I have yet to try magnessium..What you should know is that I am at the moment experiencing a very stressful time and under treatment. This is when it started. I have, at this time of writting taken a couple of extra anxiety tabs (still within tolerance, don't worry) and awaiting resuls. I also drink a few wines but this is not a precuser. I think .... maybe ... could be anxiety, depression.. or just a complete coincidence. However, the posts have suggested that depression / anxiety may play a part. I will certainly be seeing doctor to examine my ear (to rule out a physicological problem) and also try the magnesiam. For me it appears too coincidental that this is a difficult part of my life. Once again I am so sorry my dad is gone and the conversations we could have had about this!! Perhaps it would never have started in the first place. My advice for others is thisStick your finger in the ear canal (someone else said this and it does work for me)Try the magnesium treatmentSee GP for a quick look into earIf streess / anxiety a problem, get that sorted (that is easy to say I know) but try.This is starting to drive me mad and I WILL find the answer for me and share. pardon any bad spellingCheerfully yoursJohn (jcdc)"
"Otitis Media","So about 4/5 months ago I had an ear infection and a Doctor Prescribed me some Anti-Biotic Ear Spray which was fine it cleared up after a week of all of one day...at which point I went back and was prescribed some more amoxicillin it cleared up for about a week and ever since then its felt blocked as if something was in there along with a faint ringing so once again I went back to the Doctors to get it looked at and he told me to come back to get it syringed because it was blocked and he was certain the tinitus was being caused by the wax so once again a week later I go back to get it syringed but of course theres not enough wax to justify Syringing yet I still have the exact same problems hearing is muffled/tinitus and its pretty inflamed and painful does anyone have any ideas that can help? I'm going back tomorrow for the doctor to look at it again and if I dont get results I'm going to ask to see a Ear Specialist but I just wanted an idea on what might be wrong cheers for any help "
"Otitis Media","in May of 2014 i went to bed just fine and woke up with hearing loss in my right ear. the ENT doctor has treated everything but my hearing loss. Now he is talking about hearing aids.

I started about three days ago taking extra vitamins and i will post in a few weeks what the results are."

However the head pain and feeling of pressure is getting increasingly worse to an extent I am really struggling to sleep as unable to lie down and have lots of other symptoms such as constant headaches, severe pains throughout my head, dizzy spells and lots of other things.

"Otitis Media","Hi,I have registered with this forum today to enquire about additional information and support for a long term health issue that I am suffering with.After numerous medical consultations and exams I finally was referred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge to a specialist in the audiologist department.It appears that I have an issue with the Stapedial reflex muscles. This causes me pain resulting from normal level sounds. They have prescribed relaxation and sound therapy rather than surgical treatment at this stage. What I am looking for is someone to talk to about my issues and for guidance about suggested reading on this topic. My pain some days is unbearable, but the consultants at Addenbrooke's Hospital have given me hope that I could be cured. I really hope someone can help me on my journey.Thank you.Gary"
"Otitis Media","I went too a gp over a year ago was told I had a ear infection I was put on antibiotics and ear drops for a week. Week later I went back as my ear still was block, another gp put me on another stronger antibiotics, week later I went back, and was told be my ear drum was inflamed he couldn't see right inside so, he referred me to ENT, after ENT removed polyup, didn't work , then I was told I would have a op as ear drum was deseased. I was told waiting list for op can be upto 6months, 11 months later I have a op Monday but last week I had a ear test by ENT and I've already lost 40% of my hearing in my affected ear. I was told the op won't improve my hearing just prevent more polyups, and it could get worse over time.i feel I've been waiting way to long that if was treated sooner I wouldn't of lost quite a lot of my right ear hearing, as a ear infection was not treated quick enough I am angry to be honest as my hearing loss could of been prevented if treated right. Is this medical negligence, do you think I should seek legal advice? "

"Otitis Media","I had sudden hearing loss in one ear and loss of sensation in outer ear when driving to work had been experiencing tinitus for some while. Went to go next day as was vomiting,vertigo and loss of balance was told I had blocked Eustachian tube even though I had no history of any upper respiratory infection. Was given Buccal stemetil and was told it would clear. 7 days later went back to GP repeated same story was told it was blocked Eustachian tube and told it could take 4-6 weeks to resolve & sent away. 10 days later on return to work a colleague who is a GP said she would have referred me urgently to ENT. Unable to get an emergency GP appointment I was eventually telephoned by my GP who suggested a hearing test and then return to see him 5 days later a Friday as that was all he could offer. I explained my concerns about hearing loss and that it maybe permanent after searching the net. I had the hearing test next day at GP practice unhappy the test revealed no hearing in ear I rang surgery and spoke to duty GP who rang EnT and spoke to consultant . Assured I would be telephoned by consultant I felt mildly reassured only that was dashed as no one rang leaving me to chase everything myself. Eventually after a further day i secured an appointment with ENT who when saw me said the window of opportunity in trying to restore or save hearing is 10-14 days with steroid treatments. I'm awaiting a MRI and now don't know whether I will ever have any hearing restored with a profound deafness in my ear at present.Has anyone has any positive stories of hearing loss restored without surgical intervention? Really would like to know! I feel seriously let down by lack of knowledge and care by GP's"
"Otitis Media","I was fine until I developed a lovely headcold/sore throat/chest congestion. The sore throat went away, the nose clogged up, the ears clogged up, the chest congestion started.

"Otitis Media","Hey- So I have flaky, itchy, 'weepy' ears on an almost regular basis. The symptoms vary between mild states to being extremely bothersome. At its worst, as it is now, I'm inclined to assume that this ailment is causing/irritating other infections, as I constantly get swollen lymph nodes right under my jaw, on both sides, which can lead to a sore throat or a cold or anything of the sort. How are these things related, and is there a way to treat it all?I'll mention that I have a horrible habit of scratching or poking into my ears when they're itchy (which is pretty much all the time), and I know I shouldn't, I just can't help it sometimes -- it's the only relief I can get, even if it's shortlived.On a related note: I wear ear buds a lot, and I don't think they help. Is there a certain type that would be best for these irritable ears I've got?I'd appreciate some help. I live an incredibly busy life, and I can't keep having days where I can only give 80% because of an ear/throat illness. Tips?Thanks,A"
"Otitis Media","Hello,This discussion site is new to me but as my son (He's 11 years) is experiencing a lot of pain in both ears (GP confirmed glue ear but that cleared and inflamed nose few weeks ago). But strong ear pain and sinus pain in head and eye (was very photophobic too). Now continues to have bad ear/head pain and keeps him awake at night plus bad vertigo on standing and needs support to walk now. It just been going on since symptoms commenced 2 months ago. He is so distraught and we finally been for CT scan today. I know people can wait a lot longer but because its quite serious to be getting ear pain for so long, and on reading about Labyrinthitis and other medical conditions, none seem to be stating that ear pain is predominant. I keep taking or talking to GPs who do not reassure and no painkillers help. Can anyone throw any light on this, or had this please? There may be a delay in waiting for the scan results. If he sneezes or yawns he says it feels like his eardrums will burst. He has had ear infections/problems in past but nothing like this."

"Otitis Media","It started with chills and fever and both ears closed up. Then only one . This happened 4 months ago. I also got a very bad cold/flu 2 moths ago. My eaar never opened up and I have a swoshing sound. Went to a ENT who frightened me more than did anything good for me. Said my hearing on the ear is poor and that the nerve is damaaged. He said you can't do anything about it. He wants me to have an mri which I refuse. I do not have mental peace to wait for answers for 2 weeks. I am a highly sensitive artist/author type. He said chances of a tumor is less than a 1%, but I am very worried. Does anyone have this problem and is there any preferably wholistic cure?

"Otitis Media","Hello everyone.Any help on my situation will be appreciated as I have issues communicating with the local doctors.The evening of the 18th I had a sudden hearing loss while on a trip.I came back to Berlin, Germany and today the 20th of January I was proposed to undergo an operation to check my inner hear.I said I wanted a scan first and now they will try to scan me tomorrow.What do you recommend, was it a good idea to ask for a scan (the called it MIT here) first?Is the operation to check my inner ear an invasive, dangerous one?"

"Otitis Media","Hi there - I am a 34 year old woman with otosclerosis in both ears - and I am trying to decide if I am brave enough to have a baby, knowing the condition is likely to worsen. At the moment my ears aren't that bad, I don't know my percentage of loss but I don't have hearing aids. Unfortunately my condition is bilateral - and unfortunately my ENT specialist thinks it's started to effect my cochlear too - meaning a stapedectomy might not be an option. So what do I do!?I would love to hear from any women with the condition who have had children and what happened to their hearing?Does anyone know might pregnancy make the condition in just my middle ear worse - or will it make the middle ear and cochlear worse at the same rate? (hope that makes sense)I wonder if there is a specific test or scan I can request to know for sure if my cochlear has been affected?If I knew the percentage of my hearing loss now - perhaps I could guess my worst case scenario if I did get pregnant?Any thoughts / stories or info greatly received.Many thanksSarah"
"Otitis Media","Hi everyone,I'm new here so I'm not sure if I'm doing all of this right but please let me know if im rule breaking or anything!I was diagnosed with a bad ear infection in both ears on Tuesday after being unwell for a few days. I've been on amoxicillin 500mg 3 times a day since then. All week I've been finding it hard to eat and it's just getting worse. I've ask had mild diarrhea on and off (more on) for about 3 weeks and am losing weight due to it. I am at a point now after feeling poorly for a week where I'm exhausted and just struggling to have an appetite and get anything down me. Yesterday I managed a banana in the morning and 2 slices of toast at bedtime. Is this normal?And any advice or tips would be very much welcome. Thank you!"
"Otitis Media","I was given a hearing aid last week, I am now having noises in my ears, like an engine running etc. I use oxygen and a nippy ventilator so I don't know what to do. Its really getting me down, not sleeping much which I need to do.I am 49 years old. The specialist couldn't do AN MRI scan on my ears as I couldn't lie flat, don't know whether they can do a CT scan either, I thought he would have offered something when I couldn't have the MRI, I am a bit cross, I am worse since having the hearing aid, my hearing was going but at least I could use the phone which I can't now, that is really getting me down as I'm not always with my partner so we contact each other by telephone, that is the only way I communicate a lot of the time as I can't always go outw ith my breathing problems.Please help"
"Otitis Media","I had Gamma Knife treatment for a schwannoma in October 2014.Initially I was very tired and slept heavily but I soon became very depressed and sad.I do have pains in my head occasionally but no other physical symptoms .Nothing seems to stop me feeling withdrawn and depressed.Being unable to hear clearly makes group conversation difficult.My hobbies are all group activities requiring conversation.Has anyone any tips that may help me cope better.I walk and train my dogs .I live alone so interaction with people is important.an I have encouraged myself to enter some Obedience competitions.Is it common to feel so sad ?"
"Otitis Media","I have been suffering for many years now, and I'm only 23.I first went to the doctor at 19 and complained of feeling tired and just not all there. Very vague but just a feeling of being off.I've been back and forth to doctors since, had all the standard blood tests and have always come back negative. I've seen a neurologist who said it's unlikely to be narcolepsy or a specific neurological disease but did empathise with me and believe that it was essential I got to the root of the problem.My GP doesn't really know what to say and it's basically up to me now to push forward otherwise nothing will get done. Things are getting worse and it's preventing me from pushing on with my life. If i hear another person tell me it's in my head I may scream!So back to my symptoms: My problems are general malaise, spaciness, cognitive and general weakness. However much sleep I get i'm never refreshed and can fall asleep anytime any place. My cognitive functioning is really declining. I'm nearly always in a haze and zoned out. The severity varies throughout the day. My head feels heavy and my symptoms seems to peak in hot/cold atmospheres or pressure changes i.e trains, planes etcNow let me add that for many years, I have had a fullness in my ears, particularly my left ear and I also have tinnitus. I have recently noticed a correlation that when I get a particularly bad attack of tiredness and spaciness it is preceeded by heavy ringing in the left ear. At this point a cloud comes over me and I find myself staring blankly into the television or book i'm reading for 20 minutes or so.I've also had a very strange finding that often at the same time as it lifting, I feel fluid trickling down the back of my throat. I presumed it to be some unrelated sinus issue previously but having inspected it it doesn't seem to be mucus. Could it be inner ear fluid?My research into inner ear disorders has highlighted that a problem with the inner ear could cause debilitating symptoms but the majority of the symptoms aren't particularly matching of mine. The feeling is a mild drunkeness at al times and alcohol does exasperate the problem, as does eating in general.I don't get nauseous, I don't get motion sickness or severe dizziness.I do have a sense at all times of MILD dizziness, just spacy and hazy. And this trickling down of fluid has happened many times as the fog lifted.If anyone can give me some advice I would be extremely grateful."
"Otitis Media","seven month agoi had ringing in my left ear and after had pressure in my hear with clogged ears, then started having fullness in the head,i went to doctor and did CT scan , MRI and all ear tests you can think about. doctor gave me medicine called (Tanganil 500 mg) i took it for one month the fullness was less but still had it from time to time. then he said that clogged ear and dizziness it may be allergy so i was given avamys which didn't do any effect,then was given claratin which no good result was there.then i just ignored it, but after two month of ignoring its the same.any advice anyone?."
"Otitis Media","hey for 3 days i have had a really strange sensation i have never had a ear infection before so maybe it is as simple as that i have random like tears coming out one nostril when i bend down which is strange but i also feel there is cool air stuck or cool water in my ear they is a slight bit of pain in my ear but its so faint its kind of a burning but its the cool sensation thats bothering me i have also had shooting ains through my ear randomly and pressure/fullness like when you hang upside down in my head temples and ear and eyes my throat has been abit funny as it went numb yesterday and was restricted to how far i could open mymouth even though they was no pain accept a mild sore throat i have a blister on my lip for the first time ever too i have never had a cold spot or anything so i just dont know what this could be is it possible to be a mild infection/virus thats going around i do have anxiety so its leading me to think brain fluid leakage or brain clot ect but as i have never had a ear infection before i dont know what to expect ?"
"Otitis Media","I was first diagnosed with this at 40 years of age. Before I had children I should add. At the time, there was a high risk of becoming permanently deaf, so I learnt to live with it.I eventually decided that I would enquire about hearing aids ten years ago, as members of my family were complaining I was saying 'pardon' too much!! I got some from Hidden Hearing, and after much tweeking, had these for around 6-7 years. When they started to go wrong, I couldnot afford to go 'private' again, so went to Specsavers.The aids I got from Specsavers were nothing like the ones I'd had before, and I had to have them changed three times before I found ones that were ""comfortable"".Then literally one morning around 8 weeks ago, I woke and couldnot hear anything from my right ear. GP checked for wax, the aids were working ok and after another hearing test @ Specsavers, audiologist said he was going to have to refer me back to GP as the aid was turned up as far as it could be and he suggested the otosclerosis had worsened and the bone had calcified. So I am now waiting for my GP to refer me to ENT in London.As I am at the moment, I wouldnt have any second thoughts about having a stapedectomy done as even if I was one of the 5% that lost their hearing altogether, it would make no difference as I cant hear out of my right ear anyway.Someone has already recommended Mr. Jeremy Lavy to me, so I am going to ask if I can see him.My questions are:- Is there alot of pain when its been done? Are there any specific instructions (other than the obvious i.e. swimming) that you have to follow post op, how long you are in hospital for and did you have to take any time off work??I cannot wait to get my hearing sorted out. I love having a good chat on the phone, but cannot do that as I simply cannot hear them. My left ear has deteriorated too, but I can cope with that, but I hope the otosclerosis does not manifest itself in that ear too.I presume they do not operate on both together again for the obvious reasons of balance etc.I so so want it all sorted out. I want to be able to hear properly. If anyone could help me with my questions, I would be very very greatful.Thanks"
"Otitis Media","Hi,I have had a constant ringing in right ear for nearly a week now and it never goes away.

"Otitis Media","My son (aged 5 1/2) went to ENT yesterday after having a test at our local hospital in September and December '07. Yesterday tests showed his hearing had deteriorated in his right ear, up until now the problem was only in his left. We were expected to make a decision there and then about whether he will have gromits fitted and also whether his adenoids should be removed. Blown away we agreed, but 24 hours later I am unsure. Teachers inform us he is doing well at school, and that his work certainly isn't suffering. He participates and follows instructions without any problem. The only thing that really stands out is the volume on the TV having to be quite loud! I really don't know what to do, will it clear in time or should we help with the intervention of gromits? I don't want to put him through anything un-necessary, like any mum. Can any one advise if they felt like this and if so what did you choose to do?"

"Otitis Media","I am a 61 year old female with a short history of ear pain treated by antibiotics. Last July I had too much sun and was sick (vomitting) immediately after I had tinnitus and a feeling of fullness in one ear with deafness. This lasted, and several trips to the doctors the diagnosis was Eustachian Tube Dysfunction. Was referred to specialist. Had hearing test and Doctor agreed had considerable hearing loss to the one ear. He has said I need an MRI scan which I am waiting for and see him again in January. He suggested Optovent which I had already tried. or an ear popper which I bought from Boots paid 拢90! this has not worked, but other people gave good feedback on the Boots website. He suggested a grommit and hearing aid. The GP has since said grommit is not so good long term, and keep on with the valsalva man. and popper. I would be grateful if anyone else who has had grommit could give me advice I would so like to get rid of this feeling of being underwater in my ear. Now have a cold and have taken Sudafed which seems to be helping."
"Otitis Media","I am 65yrs.old & a week ago had a grommet inserted into my Rt.ear due to a collection of fluid behind the ear-drum. Since the beginning of December last year my hearing deteriorated & I can only describe it as having a feeling of my ear being full of water, all the symptons that have been documented. My Husband & I have planned a trip to Australia in February this year, because of this the wait & see method was not possible & I had no choice but to opt for surgical treatment. On the Specialist's advice I had this done under a local anaesthetic, it did not take very long but the experience was something that I would not want to repeat.To date, although my hearing has improved, I am having to take paracetamol for pain, my ear feels blocked all the time & I have a constant popping noise inside my ear which makes me feel queasy. I did not expect these side effects & wondered if anyone else has experienced similar symptons after having had a myringotomy & grommet inserted. I would love to know, my GP says that this is the norm & will take weeks or months for my ear to return to normal.[i:21c89b96e2]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:21c89b96e2]"
"Otitis Media","Has anyone in the last year had an operation to remove an acoustic neuroma?David"
"Otitis Media","Hi all!I was looking for info on stapedectomy for a friend and came across a company called Surgeryinfrance who provide a research service on \""best surgeons\"" in the south of France. I dropped them a line as they have an ENT section on their site and they told me they provide UK patients with detailed information on a choice of surgeons specialised in their required treatment and then assist the patient through the whole process.It's a paying service but they apparently make no profit from the operation itself and are not tied in to any specific surgeons or clinics. Though they wouldn't give me any names (makes sense I suppose , they did tell me that they could recommend a \""highly experienced\"" ENT surgeon who has done \""dozens\"" of stapedectomies over the past 20 years. Their quote for the operation including all consultations, tests and their research and liaison service was \""in the region of 2500 Euros\"" which seemed pretty good even considering you would need to add travel and accommodation costs. My friend is thinking about it but I thought it might be of interest to some of you Good luck!"

"Otitis Media","Hi allNot sure what's happened but exactly a week ago I went out to celebrate a birthday and got into a bit of trouble where one of my female friends got punched by a bloke. After that I approached the bloke to find there were about 15 guys. It had all kicked off and I had been headbutted and punched several times. Since Sunday, ofcourse with the behind of my ear being bruised, I've had a weird feeling inside my ear, as if something is loose, or there is water. I've cleaned my ears out, had someone look into my ear to see nothing, if i move my body (not my head) left to right, to sort of take pressure off my ear then back on, I can feel something going back and forth dependant on my movement. Does anyone know why this would be happening?"
"Otitis Media","So I am 14 and I have had a cold for the past 5 days. Yesterday I began feeling one of my ears being muffled but I thought it would just stop when I popped my ears. Unfortunately I can't pop them anymore for some reason. Towards the end of the night last night when I swallowed I felt a weird feeling in my ear like a guitar string being plucked when I swallowed but this only happened about 4 times then subsided. I get 8-10 hours sleep each night. I cleared my ears not long ago. I hope this isn't permanent. I have been listening to music through my headset but nothing above 40% volume on my laptop. I did have a loud noise put to my ear for a very short space of time that gave a small ringing sensation that stopped. I noticed this morning that it has weakened my hearing so I can barely hear in my left ear. I closed my right ear and heard almost nothing (what I did hear was probably coming through gaps in my ear that I missed) and when I closed my left I hear fine. There is no ringing in my ears although one feels as if it is full or has something in it. I would love help because my body just never works like it should"

Its so annoying and when your not thinking about it its not there!

"Otitis Media","Right let me start from the beginning....in March went to my GP with severe dizziness. I was told I had a polyp in my left ear.... my op was booked and in July they removed the polyp and was told I have had a underlaying inner-ear infection and the dizziness was vertigo. I have had the infection for nearly 7 months now, I have had 8 courses of antibiotics ( different types and strengths ) the last being amoxicillin which I had a ADR with ( ADR adverse drug reaction ) now at the present day ( 1/9/14 ) I have still got the inner-ear infection and last week went ENT and awaiting another op which I was told I would probably have to wait 28 weeks for. But my problem is. That it is affecting my life and my work and my everyday living. And no-one in the medical profession seems to care much about it. This is what I have at present on a daily basis1. Mild to severe dizziness2. Severe pain on the left side off my head and neck and eyes3. Pain in both my shoulders4. Mild to severe pains in my chest ( told by Dr at ENT it was muscular strain ) 5. Feeling of shortness of breath and a achy type pain in my lungs6. Mild to severe stomach pains. Which have now caused me not to eat I'm drinking plenty of fluids. And I'm on painkillers. I also have high BP but the is stable and controlled by LOSARTAN POTASSIUM 50 MG TABLETS. as ramipril wasn't agreeing with me. I have got to the point now where I cant take it any more. I cant go on living like this. I'm losing sleep and losing weight rapidly. I don't know where to turn to so if any one has any tips or suggestions please reply. Thankyou in advance "
"Otitis Media","I got my ear pierced a week ago today and soon after i put on a new antiseptic wash, my ear became yellow and the skin went hard.

I have 5 courses of amniotics. But they didn't do any thing. The ear infection is cause me to have mild to really bad dizzy spells. I'm currently on amoxicillin for the infection which is my 6th course of tablets. I'm constantly dizzy bit like I said it varies in intensity.

(flush warm water and peroxide into them). this. hurt. like. hell. which I was not expecting. I jumped from the pain and she said.. oh I'll be write back. that's when I saw the blood. the doctor came back in after talking to an ENT (ear nose and throat specialist) said I have an appointment in 2 weeks with him and prescribed me ear drops until then because they think my ear is infected?

"Otitis Media","I have been diagnosed with Otosclerosis in my right ear for over 10 years now. The condition was diagnosed whislt serving in HM Forces. There is no history of this condition inmy family and it therefore came as a surprise. I was initially offerd a hearing aid but unfortunately, it was of no use. In crowded rooms, in particular, social events, I struggle to hear a basic conversation.I have now left HM Forces and have an ENT appointment shortly. Having read up on the condition on a number of sites, it appears that surgery may be a possible alternative. Why therefore, does the NHS not offer this alternative? I for one intend to request surgery - stapedectomy - and I would advise all sufferers to research the subject and if they feel that they qualify, demand surgery also.[i:d89ac0b2da]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:d89ac0b2da]"
"Otitis Media","Hi, my names Ryan.I've had a blocked euthracian tube in my left ear for about 2 weeks that developed from a sore throat 3 weeks ago. I went to the GP and he prescribed me a 5 course on amoxicillin, but it's turned out I had a viral ear infection.I have a constant ringing for 2 weeks, and the pressure in my ear had reduced quite a bit, but it tends to be in the evenings when my ear gets a bit stuffy and I can hearmy voice in my head, when I pinch my nose and close my mouth and blow it pops and crackles.I think my the pressure in my ear is reducing a little bit every day but the ringinging remains constant. I'm using decongestants when I get a bit stuffy which tends to be first thing in the morning and loads of steam baths.How long do etds take to clear up? And once the tube opens up again how long before the symptons die down like the pressure feeling and ringing?Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I'm trying to stay positive but I find myself teetering on the edge of a break down some times."
"Otitis Media","Hi everyoneI've had a blocked ear for 4 days. It's been accompanied by a stuffy nose on and off, but the ear has been constantly blocked. I went to an ENT yesterday who did a scope in my nostrils and checked my ears, said there is absolutely no wax or infection, no growths or obstructions. He said it could be due to a lack of air pressure in my ear, which may nor may not resolve spontaneously and which cannot be treated. I did a hearing test as well.When I open and close my jaw I can hear a fluid- like sound, but the doc says there's no fluid buildup there.I have had problems with the ear before due to a water skiing accident, but it's been fine for years. Now I'm getting pain in the ear. It seems I've exhausted the diagnostic options. I'm really worried. What else could it be?"
"Otitis Media","Hi,For over two years, my mother has suffered from ears which have been chronically blocked. She describes the feeling as 'gluey', as if there has been a build-up of fluid in the Eustachian tube, but there has been nothing to suggest anything of the sort in the examinations she has had. Besides causing her anxiety, it has resulted in mild coordination problems, e.g. when she walks, especially in crowds, she feels as if her balance is not quite right. She does not suffer from hearing problems. The condition varies in its severity between days -- sometimes (although not often) the ears do clear. The potential causes could be: 1) an allergy; but besides a likely mild intolerance to wheat, she hasn't tested positive for any allergies. She has also suffered from a sensitive stomach (but only for about a year) which may or may not be related to this. 2) a deviated septum; an ear specialist suggested that she have an operation to have it corrected -- but since he could not guarantee it would solve the problem, combined with her reluctance to have an operation, she is unlikely to have this done without substantial proof. 3) stress; she has undergone a disproportionately high amount of stress in the past three to five years. My personal (but completely unverifiable) theory is that the condition operates on the same principle as eczema, being triggered and further intensified by psychological distress. Since the problem is causing her anxiety, it becomes a vicious cycle. 4) psychosomatic; this is related to the above, and it undeniably plays a part -- but she is nonetheless adamant that the blockage is physical, even if it is aggravated by the ensuing stress. Also, if she is in a social environment with a glass of wine, the condition is alleviated due to her relaxing.5) age; again, related to 3) and 4), she is 60, an age which can apparently result in increased stress for women. Unfortunately, the condition is very psychologically taxing for her and the accompanying anxiety prevents her from undertaking as much as she would like. If anyone has any insights on what her condition might be, or how it may be treated, they would be much appreciated.Many thanks."

I don麓t feel like perforating my tympanic membrane to insert drainage tubes? so, this year I麓ve search the internet for alternative solutions and found 3 devices which open the Eustachian tubes. I麓m amazed that no doctor told me about them?Or they don麓t know about them or they know them but prefer to enrich the pharmaceutical companies and don麓t give a sh*t about us. I don麓t know what麓s worst?Hear are the web addresses:The EARDOC, costs 35 euros, produces subsonic vibrations which opens the Eustachian tube and enables trapped air and fluids from the middle ear to drain into the mouth.http://www.eardoc.info/buy-now/The OTOVENT, costs 11 euros, when you inflates the balloon with the nose the pressure should open the Eustachian tubehttp://www.pointpharmacy.com/shop/customer/product.php?productid=6965&cat=0&page=The EARPOPPER, costs around 150 euros, it creates a flux of air through the nose and when you shallow it should open the Eustachian tubehttp://www.earpopper.com/earpopper/index.htmI麓ve bought the eardoc and otovent but only tried the first one. I think it works for me and I think it麓s worth trying for all of you who are suffering so muchWish you the best luckRegards from Spain! "
"Otitis Media","I still have ear pain and a brown discharge"
"Otitis Media","13/8/06I am 57 years old and have had a perforated eardrum since I was 4 yrs old. My first mastoid operation was age 16, 1965, but still continued to have ear infections and discharge throughout the years, although I never had earache as such, although I have to say the mastoid operation was extremely painful for many days after the operation. Seven years ago on the recommendation of my ENT specialist I underwent another mastoid operation , again a very painful experience, and swore I would never have another operation. Since then I have still experienced infections and discharge. About 4 weeks ago I had yet another ear infection this time I experienced some earache which is unusual, as I did not have an appointment due at the hospital (I usually have a 6 month check up) I saw my GP who prescribed antiboitics it still didnt clear, so returned to my GP who gave me another course of antibiotics which I have just finished taking two days ago. The discharge is still there. I have an appointment to see the specialist in two weeks time, although I must say, I do not find this very helpful as I never see the same doctor. I don't realy know why I am writing this but I am just so fed up with the whole thing and and absolutely terrified about having another mastoid operation. I just don't understand why in this day and age there is no apparent 'cure' for this dreadful ailment.[i:f8eb9fd625]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:f8eb9fd625]"
"Otitis Media","My son has had ear infections all his life he is 9. He went into hospital for investigations and they told me that he has got a diseased mastoid. He has got to go in for surgery. I do not know if he will loose any hearing or get any facial paralysis, how long he will be in hospital, or what pain he will be in when he comes out and how long will it last[i:c9702e0ee4]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:c9702e0ee4]"
"Otitis Media","I had to spread the news that there is a \""cure\"" for glue ear now available. Having had to have a grommet in one ear 2 years ago, I was determined not to have the same again unless absolutely necessary.Research on the internet led me to a new device called an Ear Popper and luckily there is one company in England that imports them. I received mine yesterday and can already hear properly again!It is a small handheld device which emits a flow of air. Inserted into the nostril and plugging the other, one swallows and hey presto air is pushed up the tube and into the middle ear. It is a bit like holding the nose closed and blowing, but far more effective.I found it by Googling - there is a lot more info on American websites. The bad news is that it cost me 拢220, but I think it worth every penny.In my opinion this should be available at GP's surgeries. If it were a lot of surgical procedures on young children could be avoided!"
"Otitis Media","A few months ago, I didn't even know what otosclerosis or a stapedectomy were. A friend mentioned that her hearing had been degenerating for 10 years and that she had spent over 拢10,000 on hearing aids during that time. Her audiograms were getting worse and she too was told that surgery was a risky procedure with 1% chance of going deaf... the prospect of going deaf at 40 it made her feel quite down.I decided to look into it and spoke to old doctor friend of mine who knows most of the good (and not so good!) surgeons in France. He put me in touch with a very good ORL surgeon specialised in auditive problems and my friend came down to see him for a check-up and to see what could be done. He was astounded by her audiograms and said that she should never have been fitted with hearing aids given that her inner ear was fine and that the loss of hearing was basically a mechanical problems easily resolved with a stapedectomy . He even went as far as to say that if he had referred her to a hearing clinic for aids, they would have seriously questioned his competence!He then went on to say that 1% chance of total hearing loss and the idea that the operation may only be good for a few years was valid...but 15 years ago. Nowadays it is around 0.2% in France overall, that is to say including good/bad surgeons, other complications etc. Personally he has been doing 20-25 stapedectomies a year and has never had a patient lose their hearing (touch wood!) or have to wear aids. The procedure itself takes about an hour and no overnight stay is required.Needless to say, my friend is really thrilled and is planning to have her first stapedectomy before Xmas when work calms down (otherwise there would be no waiting time!). The French medical system is undoubtedly one of the best in the world but the language barrier and laws prohibiting advertising of medical services make it difficult for Brits to get information and to take advantage of it. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you are considering it and need help or information.[i:ded82fb8ff]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:ded82fb8ff]"
"Otitis Media","people say this condition can be very painful but i found paracetamol really helps . my first indication anything was wrong was i suddenly went quite deaf, then felt pressure builing up and within 2 hours was in pain. this started at 6pm and during the night my drum must have perforated as by morning the pressure and pain had gone although my hearing was still affected. i went to doctors who confermed perforated eardrum and was given antibiotics for week and told to return in 4 to 6 weeks as drum should heel itself."

He has been going to speach therpy since he was two. I had a meeting before he went to school and told the doctors that I did,nt thing he would cope well in main stream school at that time, but they did,nt listen to me.Now i face a second meeting to decide what to do, I can,t face taking him out of school now he has made loads of pals.

"Otitis Media","Hi Good to read about others experiences but it all seems to be very individual. I had my operation in my left ear 3 weeks ago. I was very surprised that it took me over a week to feel able to move around. I had the packing removed 5 days a go and still can not hear- Disappointing as it seems that most seem to get some hearing back when the packing is removed. I am still feeling dizzy/motion sickness, and hiccups are like mini explosions in my head. I have been told that it takes time but am feeling very frustrated. I am looking for some reassurance that all will be well and I have underestitmated my recovery time. I have been off work for three weeks and having returned to day I am think I should not have been so keen."
"Otitis Media","This is the second time now this year I've had an ear infection to the point that I can't sleep through the night due to sharp stabbing pain. I've found to relieve the lock-jaw type of pain hot drinks seem to help tempoarily, so I'm having lots of hot drinks all the time! You can get \""Otex Ear Drops\"" over the counter for under 拢5.00 which attempts to break down any blocked wax deep within the ear, and take \""Ibuprofen\"" for the sharp pain to help you through the night. I seem to only get this when I'm feeling exhausted or run down. This is day two at the moment, and from what I'm reading shouldn't last much longer, however if the body is meant to react to the bacteria infection naturally without needing medication, I'd wish it got on with it as I must say it is excrusiatingly painful."
"Otitis Media","My son is 14 months old. He did not pass his 8 month hearing check so was refered to the audiology clinic where he did not pass the test as he did not respond to very low or high tones. When they tested his ear drums they found that one slightly moved and the other one not at all and that there was congestion in both ears. As he has just recovered from chicken pox and a bad cold they have said to leave him for 3 months and then they will retest him. They also said that they think he is too distracted by the toys and maybe has selective hearing! Im not so sure even though there are no obvious signs and he is developing as fast as my little girl did after reading the other comments im now thinking i should maybe get another opinion what do you think?[i:b7b44a666f]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:b7b44a666f]"
"Otitis Media","My daughter is 3 and is constantly getting colds and having ear infections. I insisted in February that she be referred to a specialist and went to see him yesterday. She had a couple of tests and he said she had glue ear and put her down for the grommets and for her adenoids to be removed in less then 2 months. I'm extremely frightened and dont know what to do for the best, i kind of wished i never read most of these experiences!!!!!! Can anyone give me something positive to hold on to?!"
"Otitis Media","i had glue ear from when i was a little child, i think it developed soon after i was born.. i didn't learn to speak until i was 4 when i went to a playgroup when all the children spoke loudly. It wasn't even picked up that i had hearing problems until a hearing test at school in the winter showed i had problems, i went to the hospital every year for a hearing test but it was always scheduled in the summer until years later i had one in the winter and they found out i had only 40% hearing, the hospital said to wait until i grew out of it in which i got constant infections and ear aches.. I suffered greatly and not only that but i had trouble learning at school. I would get told off for daydreaming and not listening in lessons when it was because i couldn't hear them. My mother came in one day and told every teacher off for treating me badly when it wasn't my fault and they finally listened and tried to help me rather than telling me off. Having glue ear meant that to help i naturally learnt to read lips, this helped me with my learning even if people thought i was odd for staring at them.I finally had an operation for grommits at the age of 8, it dramatically helped my hearing and i found i could hear things like the wind against the grass and trees and i never had a problem again. until now.I am now 17 years old and last winter is started having dulled hearing and kept getting constant colds and viruses. i told my doctor and he tried giving me some de-congestant to clear my ears.When that didn't work he referred me to the hospital and i have just been today and had a hearing test. the consultant who i had back when i was 8 told me i had glue ear yet again and instantly put me on the waiting list for having the operation again, i cant believe i'm going to have to go through this whole thing again after growing up with it. the consultant has also put me on some nasal spray that i have to use everyday to try to clear the tube but if it doesn't work i will have the operation in about three months time. Who's to say i wont just get it again later?"
"Otitis Media","I had a Stapendectomy implant about 15 years ago in the UK. The implant,as can now judge, started to fail during 2005 but without being detected during visits to my local Hospital Hearing Centre. The result was that unknown to me, my implant had 'broken down'. Earlier this year (2006) I flew to the USA with a severe head cold and with the unknown 'failing implant'. This combination resulted in my getting Pneumococal (Bacterial) Meningitis whilst in the USA, which was very serious. After treatment for the Meningitis I was introduced to an American ENT Specialist who suggested he ""was the wrong person to deal with this"" and referred me to a 'pure ear' Specialist. My subsequent operation was performed under local anaesthetic and recovery only took a few hours. I had to wait for the ear to heal before I could fly home, about 6 weeks in all. The effects I had experienced during my first operation (sickness and giddiness, referred to by another subscriber on this site) were non-existent after this operation and I can honestly say that my ear has never been as good with all 'new techology' used to repair the first implant. It was truly painless and easy and should now last for ever. Stainless steel components are used for better durability. I am now contemplating having my other ear operated on early 2007. I am sharing my experience for anybody else who may have doubts about their implant who could, under the wrong circumstances have the same experience as myself and not be as fortunate as I in being in the right place at the right time to get help and have everything fixed.Hope this helps somebody.[i:62dd0dd4fd]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:62dd0dd4fd]"
"Otitis Media","My son is 6 and has had persistent glue ear for at least a year. As with lots of children with this condition his hearing worsens during and after a cold.When he was a baby he had an allergic reaction to cows milk, ie vomiting. I replaced it with soya milk and he improved. When I reintroduced cows milk, his eczema gradually worsened, so I cut out wheat and dairy for 3 months, which cured the eczema.Since then he has had only a little milk, until starting school where he drinks it daily. I'm now thinking that his glue ear started soon after he started school. I may be clutching at straws but will try to cut out dairy again, in the absence of any other help available. I would love to know if there are any exercises people use to help their children to concentrate when they are disappearing into their own little worlds due to diminished hearing.[i:6e02a7bfb0]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:6e02a7bfb0]"
"Otitis Media","well its 5.10 am monday morning, after repeated attempts to get to sleep I gave up, decided to take more painkillers that dont seem to know what their purpose is, my hair is all over the place after trying to massage my head, or pull my hair out... not quite sure which, so I've been sat here trawling through the net trying to distract myself from the pain, when I stumble across this place. I have to tell you its so nice in a bizzare kinda way that I'm not alone, I mean people say aw poor you it must be awful, but they dont really know do they!!! I've had this for about 18 months, suffer from ezema, went swimming got a sore ear.... so I thought, its getting worse all the time, my GP has been great, the pills and the drops worked to begin with, then failed me big style, so he sent me to the ENT clinic where I've been going fo the past year, but the fact its getting worse does not inspire me, I find the only thing that works is the aspiration and the cream packing, my last visit was thursday for the aspiration but by friday i had the twinges yet again, so im now waiting for the ENT clinic to open and hopefully get in today, my Jaw hurts, I cant hear properly, I have ringing in it, and it even feels like there is a pulse in there.I have found a web site though which sells ear putty, and an odd looking alice band type thing for swimming which I will try once feeling up to it.[i:2eb84d75f7]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:2eb84d75f7]"
"Otitis Media","I live in Los Angeles (originally from Australia) and haven't had any problems with my ears since I was 7 and had my parents had my tonsils removed because I kept getting tonsilitis and related ear infections. The infections also affected my hearing and my school work suffered. The Aussie doctor took out my tonsils and inserted grommets in both ears which eventually fell out after a while and I had no probs until now! I'm 40 yrs old and have had a bacterial middle ear infection for approx. 1 year now. Not sure how I got it, but I've been to 3 different well respected ENTs here in Beverly Hills and they all refused to give me antibiotics to properly kill the infection. Just like all the GPs here in America, they won't give patients antibiotics even if you beg! I've had them offer me much more potent drugs, even addictive drugs, but they refuse to write a script for antibiotics for some reason. Anyway, they cleaned out my ear and prescribed antibacterial and dermatological ear drops which didn't kill the infection. If anything the dermo drops aggravated my ear and blocked it so I couldn't hear anything cos the drops blocked my ear and I had glue ear. I was very distressed cos I need my hearing for my job as an attorney! Now I'm on my last week of a much anticipated vacation and I've had an excruciating ear ache since before the week-end and have been bedridden. I can tolerate a lot of pain, but this has been the worst pain ever! I have to wait until tomorrow to see another ENT for help cos I don't want to wait in the Cedars ER for hours! My right ear and face are double the size they normally are. I did some research on the internet and I'm sure I have AOM (acute otitis media) which is fluid in middle ear, PAIN, red and bulging eardrum, & fever. I am DEMANDING the doc give me (i) a ceftriaxone injection & vicodin for the pain; (ii) Augmentin to kill the infection (luckily I had some at home which has helped me a bit), and (iii) Ibuprofin for my fever. I almost feel like suing these so-called specialists for prolonging my agony for so long. I may even have permanent ear damage cos they didn't treat my infection a year ago when I first saw them all! I understand how patients must feel so let down by their physicians, especially when they're in PAIN! My advice is to not treat doctors as Gods, like they know everything, but to educate yourself thru research and tell them what to prescribe and be very aggressive about it.:headhurts:[i:6346df4f2e]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:6346df4f2e]"
"Otitis Media","Hi! My son is gong to be 5 in a few months and I have been concerned about his hearing for about 6 months. I have been to the doctors 4 times in the last year and they all said that the ear looked fine, there was ear wax but it looked normal. I finally had enoigh and insisted that I see an audiologist. When we he had the test, the audilogist did say that the hearing was below the standard level and because he had a cold this may be the reason, I was advised to come back in 3 months. I said that I did not want to wait for so long and wanted to see the consultant ASAP. Two weeks later at his school he had his hearing test and he failed that. I am now waiting for the appointment with the consultant and I hope that he does not need a hearing aid.[i:c8140c398d]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:c8140c398d]"
"Otitis Media","My 7 year old son had his first operation when he was 2 years old, he had his tonsils and adenoids taken out and his first set of grommits put in. Just 4 months later the grommits had come out without correcting his hearing problem, it was decided to put some more grommits in but yet again they did not work for him. it took another 2 attempts with the grommits within a year of each other before his consultant offerd me a same kind of procedure as the grommit but it was called the T tube procedure it works like a grommit but it is permanant. we decieded to try the T tube and yes it has worked his hearing is now perfect but we solve one problem and another problem accures, my son now suffers with at least one ear infection a month some worse than others. when we discussed his ear infections with his consultant he gave us an alternative. We could either take the T tubes out and my sons hearing would fails and he would need to wear hearing aids, or we can keep the T tubes in and basicly put up with the monthly ear infections, i have just 2 months to decide i relly dont know what to do for the best.:?:headhurts:[i:4db26fd4dd]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:4db26fd4dd]"
