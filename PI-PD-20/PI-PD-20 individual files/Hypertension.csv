"Hypertension","can I eventually get off blood pressure meds","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/can-i-eventually-get-off-blood-pressure-meds-738377","I was just prescribed lisinopril today for my high blood pressure. For the last few months its has been consistently high, where as before it was always normal. It would range from 135-165. There have been a few life changes in the past 6 months, as well as a lot of new stress. I ruptured a disc about 6 months ago which gradually got worse to the point where i couldn't hardly walk for 2-3 months. Then after that healed I was laid off from work. I stopped working out completely at the beginning of the rupture as well. I noticed my blood pressure started becoming high around the time I could hardly walk which was about 3 months ago.My diet has never been the best and I am a smoker. But after all of this I am going to start watching what I eat and start exercising and try to quit smoking. I'm only 35 years old which makes me think I'm too young to be dealing with this.My question is, if I'm able to start exercising regularly and get my diet in check, and quit smoking, will I potentially be able to get off the medicine? Also will I be able to tell if my body doesn't need it any more if those changes help or will I just need to get off to know?"

I normally live on the east coast.When I go to Utah, my BP rises, compared to east coast BP. This has happened for 3 or 4 years. When I return to the east coast, it goes back to normal.One obvious guess is other lifestyle changes, such as change in diet. But I probably eat more salt when I'm home. I go to the gym less often in Utah. (Note: Salt Lake City elevation is around 4,500 ft; the ski area elevation is 8,500--10,500.)I am a 75 y.o. while male in generally very good health, with well-controlled HT.I've found some research that shows that BP rises with increased elevation, but there's not much on this matter.Anyone have any guesses? My Utah internist dismisses my observations, says he is not aware of increases in BP as a function of increased elevation."

I have been eating extra healthy (veggies, egg whites, no extra salt, yougurts, nuts, whole grains, etc) since then (with some cheat meals in between). I have lost about 16 pounds but still don't feel great.Now I find that most times after I eat, within half an hour I get dizzy, a bit nausea and have an annoying headache in my temple area. I have not noticed any specific foods that cause this since most do. However, I am thinking it may happen more when I am eating something with higher sodium (since I cut out most of the salt in my diet).Its getting really annoying that after almost anything I eat (snack or meal) I almost immediately get headache and dizzy. Its manageable but annoying and will last all day.I do not have diabetes or any other conditions. Does this have to do with blood pressure? the meds? the salt? Trying to do everything right...and end up with different crappy symptoms 😦"

Currently I'm 16, but about 3-4 years ago they noticed my BP was slightly elevated during a check up. Nothing extreme so they didn't do anything about it. However about 2 years ago I started experiencing quite a lot of shortness of breath, especially during rest, so I went to my GP and at that time my BP measured around 130/90. Still nothing extreme but quite high for a 14 year old. I did some lung tests but everything looked good so she sent me to a cardiologist just in case. During a physical exam he noticed that I had a very weak pulse in one side of my groin, I have no idea what that means but it's worth mentioning. I did an ambulatory BP monitoring which also measured around 130/90 as a daily average (If I remember correctly, I'm not sure) and later I also did an echocardiogram that looked normal. Since they couldn't find anything they assumed there wasn't a particular cause and no more tests were done.That was a while ago but the last few months my shortness of breath has gotten significantly worse and I've started experiencing other symptoms such as:-fatigue-dizzy spells where I have to sit down or I will faint-Increasing headaches-palpitations (although my heart rate is generally very fast, around 90-100 bpm sitting down)-ringing in ears, especially the right one-blurry vision, especially the right eye as wellSo i decided to see my doctor last week. These were my BP readings:146/110136/105130/103She did some blood tests as well but I haven't gotten the results yet. But as you can tell, it's my diastolic pressure I'm worried about. What could be the cause of this and could it be related to my symptoms? I'm not overweight and don't have any family history of hypertension or heart disease that I know of."

I know those numbers are not great but they are not that bad either but I start thinking about extreme worst.I tried another approach as well by promising myself to measure BP only once a month but that also did not help. in 10-15 days I started thinking that what if my blood pressure is not normal, what if its too high and my panic triggered again.This anxiety is killing me. I get all other weird feelings because of that.Has anyone gone through similar phase? I will really really appreciate some tips to deal with this."

At first I was prescribed amlodipine (2.5mg), but it gave me heart palpitations. Then I was prescribed lisinopril (2.5mg), but it gave me chest pains, lower torso pains, and pains ""down there"" (these pains were short and sharp yet dull) . (I took both of those medications during the day). Now I have been taking Bystolic (2.5mg), but at night to avoid side effects because I am a full time college student and I need to be awake and focused during class lol(though for like the first three days I woke up with a little shortness of breath). The only thing is it doesn't drop my blood pressure throughout the day like the others and today my blood pressure has been elevated causing my chest pains and slight tremors to come back. I am kind of afraid to take it during the day because I don't know how it would affect me. So I have a couple questions, what medication you would refer to a 19 year old who has a clean medical history? Why you think I may have had the adverse side effect I had in the past or what ingredient that's in those two medications you think I may be allergic to? What are the ""safest"" (I know no drug is truly safe to take, especially these ones) blood pressure medications? Also, how long do side effects last and if the effects went away after a few days because I was sleep and didn't know will they come back if I take the bystolic in the day time?"

I have noticed, though, that fairly regularly about 9 or 10 hours after I take it, I experience some mild nausea--kind of a queasy feeling that emerges regardless of what I'm doing and lasts from 30 minutes to an hour. I didn't experience this prior to taking lisinopril, so I'm wondering if it's connected to that. Has anyone else experienced this? It doesn't happen every day, but it happens with enough frequency that I notice, and every time it's within that same time window (like if I took my medication later in the morning, it will be later in the evening when I experience the queasy stomach). I'm trying to determine if what I eat or other behavior helps determine whether or not it happens, but that's proving to be challenging. I thought maybe potatoes (potassium) through the day was the culprit, but I'm not sure that's consistent. I think water intake could be related. It has even seemed as if drinking up on water right at the onset, helps the feeling pass more quickly. One thing that doesn't help is that if I've just had a heavy meal out--fried food or potatoes or junky stuff--and then it's a day when the queasiness hits, that mild nausea has occasionally (a handful of times) not subsided but turned into a miserable evening of discomfort--perhaps just because there's more in my stomach to get unsettled. Hoping someone else has some experience with this and can shed some light. Thanks!"

I started out at 184/100, and was put on 40mg Lisinopril in January. Almost immediately I started to suffer with vertigo and dizzy spells where my hearing would cut out, cold sweats and fatigue. I knew that the first two weeks there would be some expected side effects, so I waited to see if they would pass. About a month later, I went back to my doctor, with a BP reading of 122/78, and she swapped me to Losartan Potassium 25mg. The same side effects continued, and after another month or so I went back (BP 126/90) and was swapped to Amlodipine Besylate 5mg. I've been on that since March, as there aren't any other medications my doctor can switch me to without going to beta blockers. But my symptoms have worsened.It’s like spacing out but worse? But also not like dissociating. For 10 or 15 seconds, I’m not “there” but I have the after image of whatever I was looking at before. Sometimes my eyes cross and I can’t un-cross them, or sometimes they close and I can’t keep them open, what normally brings me “back” is that I’ll sway too much to one side, or my head will jerk down. It used to be that parts of my body would jerk but not so much now. I wouldn’t say I’m confused? I know who/what/where I am but I don’t know what I was doing/am doing/should do next. It doesn't feel like falling asleep, it feels like my brain lagged out, or I’m behind a loading screen in a video game. I've been tracking them and can't find any triggers.I've had an MRI and EEG, and I'm waiting for the follow-up appointment in September to go over those results. I've also got a consultation with a cardiologist in October. I got a CPAP machine a few months ago with a diagnose of sleep apnea, but with the meds and stress from my symptoms it's hard to say if that's helped my BP any. We're trying to be thorough and check all the bases, but I can't shake the feeling that it's related to the medication, because it only started with them. I wanted to know if anyone else has experienced this and what results you had?"

I remember having it taken in 1994 when I was 31 and it was through the roof.

Told to come back next week to have it checked again but in the meantime check reading with my own monitor.

BP was always low normal-120/70, no shortness of breath, no exercise intolerance. After heavy periods, I ended up with anemia which caused shortness of breath that still persists (nearly 5 months later). My BP suddenly went up to 108 diastolic (systolic didn't go above 135 or so), was accompanied with flushed skin, shortness of breath, severe headache and chest discomfort. I was initially put on HCTZ, which didn't help. I saw a cardiologist who suspects my BP spiked from the tachycardia (weird as that hasn't happened in all these years..but very possible). He put me on 2.5 mg of Bisoprolol twice a day, starting with once a day and going up if HR is still above 90. The 2.5 mg brought my heart rate down to 70 and my diastolic down between 77-84 (which is still a bit higher than it used to be before the spike). I am not taking the 5 mg as it lowered my heart rate to 50, and I am not very comfortable with that plus from what I am reading it's a hard medicine to wean off (something I'd like to do eventually, under medical supervision of course) so if I am doing well on a lower dose, I'd keep it that way,I would love to hear from anyone who can relate to this or has any thoughts/experiences to share."
"Hypertension","How is your hypertension treated?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/how-is-your-hypertension-treated--693385","Hello. I am a 44 year old female who has had chronic high blood pressure since I was in college. Seems to just be bad genes, as I've been through every test imaginable and the doctors have never discovered a 'reason' for it (no kidney issues, etc). For as long as I can remember, my blood pressure was controlled quite well on Coreg CR, 40 mg. In the last year or so (I think in relationship to perimenopause) it has steadily increased and I am working closely with my doctor to tweak my treatment and find a medication/combination that works well. I am currently taking hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg), Lisinopril (5 mg) and Coreg (40 mg). The doctor had me try cutting out the Coreg to see what would happen, and although my BP didn't get too high, my pulse became quite fast, even at rest. So, the doctor is now having me try 20 mg Coreg along with the other 2 meds. I guess my question is (and I'll discuss this with my doctor, too) is - how can I get this back down to just 1 or 2 meds? Having to take 3 pills every morning seems, to me, to be quite a lot. Is 3 meds a 'standard' treatment for HBP? I know combinations are often beneficial over a single med, but, I guess, just ugh. 3 meds. Any insight would be appreciated. Thanks!"

He started me on Amlodopine 5mg.

After four trips to the hospital / clinic, the doctors finally identified that his blood pressure was dangerously high, like 145/100. They admitted us to the hospital and then ICU and slowly brought his blood pressure back under control with Labetelol and Norvasc.Since then, we have been searching for a cause (and solution) with no luck, and we're running out of things to look at. We have, at times, suspected a pheochromocytoma, renal artery stenosis, seizures, heart problems, and more, and, essentially, the doctors are running out of things to look for. I can provide more detail if desired, but here are some of the things we've done:I'm sure there's more that I'm missing, but the doctors have essentially exhausted their testing. He's on 2.2 milligrams of amlodapine (Norvasc) twice daily and it more-or-less keeps his blood pressure below 110/xx, but we have been having to add in the Labetelol recently on an as-needed basis to keep it below 120/xx.My wife and I are really scared for him - this whole thing has been just killing us.

Also sorry for the lengthy post in advance.2 years ago I was diagnosed with panic disorder and generalized anxiety. Sometime last year I had two really bad panic attacks which I called the paramedics for. The took my vitals and my blood pressure was 172/128 the first time and 180/124 the second panic attack. I had another one recently which shot my blood pressure up to 172/117. When I got to the hospital, my blood pressure had dropped to about 135-140/85-90. This frightened me so I decided to buy a blood pressure machine which isn't smart for someone with anxiety but I needed to know if my blood pressure spiked on other occasions. One night I had a panic attack that woke me from my sleep, I immediately got up and took my blood pressure and it was 205/115. 5 minutes later 150/90. Then eventually went back to 120/79.This part is a bit personal and a little embarrassing, but I was curious about blood pressure during certain activities like self pleasure. So, each time I engage in self pleasure I take my blood pressure in the arm that I am not using and each time my blood pressure spikes upward 170-182/120-130. This can't be normal. I brought up this issue with my doctor who just brushed it off as anxiety. He says I am too young, (28) and in shape to be worried about blood pressure because every time he takes it, it's normal. He says of course your blood pressure is going to spike with anxiety + activity. However from what I read, your diastolic shouldn't change much and mine spikes along with my systolic to extreme numbers.I guess my question to you guys is, do you agree with my doctor or should I look into seeing another doctor about these concerns? Does anyone else experience these kind of spikes? What could be causing this high of a spike?"

I'm a 29 year old female with chronic tachycardia and high blood pressure. I was recently put on metoprolol but had horrible side effects. So, my doctors switched me to atenolol a few days ago. It has had a lot less side effects, but the one thing that i have noticed is that when it comes about 5 hours before taking my next dosage (im on 25 mg every 24 hours) i start feeling SO cloudy headed and fatigued that I cant hardly funtion at all! Has anyone else experienced this? Im currently taking it in the evening (because with metoprolol i had to take it before bed or i would get so sick) and im wondering if I should switch to taking it in the mornings instead - so that once it starts ""wearing off"" and i feel lousy, that would be in the night time instead of the middle of the day? Or is it just a coincidence that im feeling lousy mid day? I feel fine when i first wake up, but then around noon-2 or so i feel so wiped out..... When do most people take this drug? Of course this is something that I plan to follow up with my doctor about, but its a holiday weekend and they wont be back for 4 more days - so i just thought that I would ask other peoples experiences in the meantime. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? When do you feel is the best time to take this medication? Any other feedback? I know fatigue can be a side effect with this in general, but wondering why it only gets so bad at certain points...."

Recently (Past few weeks) my blood pressure has been quite high. It stays at or around 130/90. A few days earlier it even went up to 145/95. I’m asymptomatic except my ears get hot, sort of feels like hot air coming out of my ears. That’s when I know my pressure might be high. My late father had high blood pressure, my older sister takes blood pressure medications and another one of my older sisters have also recently started taking medications for blood pressure. I’m not too keen on taking blood pressure medications as I’ve heard that if you start taking blood pressure medications you can’t stop taking them. Many people have said that 130/90 or 130/80 is normal for my age but I’m afraid this might damage me internally (heart, brain etc). I’ve done several Echocardiograms and all of them have reported to be normal. Another risk factor is that I’m obese. But I’ve been controlling my diet and walking for an hour daily.

"Hypertension","High Blood Pressure + Neck/Headaches Issues/Heart Rate Up!","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/high-blood-pressure-neck-headaches-issues-heart-rate-up--687151","Hi Family,I've posted here and thought about doing it again. I'm extremely on edge and always thinking about this issue I have with the BP. If you go back to my post history you can read my start on some meds that I wasn't in agreement with. After my initial post about 7 months ago, I decided to change my doctor who was my primary care. I started to get into trying to solve the problem and getting everything done on me to see what was really wrong. Before my initial post to sum up what happen. I had a doctors appointment with my heart doctor. I was worked up the whole time driving out there which is 25 miles and I parked so far away, by the time I got to his office (walking) I was shot. I got hooked up with the EKG, all was well but my pressure was high and heart rate was high. I do have a history of anxiety and worry. He wrote me a script for Metropol Suricate 50mg. He also gave me a heart monitor for 4 days and that was about it. I went back and he told me after review, everything was good. I really do not believe that called for the med, but that is fine. As I said, I would go to the new GP and get through check of blood, etc. That always came back great. Off the bat, I was low on folic acid, vit D, and B12. Later, the B12 would come back higher after I started taking a prescription. From what I was told the blood work is all on the up and up. I just can't seem to get over this issue. On my last meeting with my GP, I told him the Metropol was not doing anything, so we decided to stop it. We started over to Lorstan 25MG, I was originally taking out night at 6pm, but switched to morning right when I head into work. I feel this has been better for me on the BP side. I check my pressure daily, which I start to over obsess over it, which is a problem, as I am thinking the worst and that shoots up my anxiety for worry. Any random pain I get is always a problem, but seems to go away like an hour later or when I feel calm again. I get random pains, not sure what to count them anymore. If they are heart burn or what but it really is annoying. I always think the worst! I think I do have heart burn which mimics a lot of the symptoms of chest pain since I am very sensitive to Advil and all that jazz. I just can't catch a break. Since about a week ago I went to go see a new heart doctor that my GP referred me too. I went in, they took my pressure which was a high (Haven't took Lorstan that day yet) and I was at 145/90 or 92, something like that. They wrote it down and we did our normal EKG, all was well. I met with the doctor, prior to that my old heart doctor sent me to do a calcium scoring test at a MRI lab, which came back a score of zero back in 2017. The new heart doctor was set back that they sent me for all these tests, as I am a 30 year male. He said the heart is strong, sure the BP is a little high, but we can treat the main problem for you is to loose weight. He said that is what we need to do, since that will treat other factors that I have. I am 5'6 and standing at 242lbs. I decided from that day to push hard and get active and lose weight. Earlier this week on Tuesday, I met with their nutoristist to go over a plan which was very basic and I will start my own to start to meal prep. I have started on my own to start cutting down on the bad items which started on Tuesday. They want me to get down to 150, but I told them baby steps. I am really shooting for 220, then to 200, and try to level out at 180. It will be a lot of weight to lose, but I will stay focused. I noticed when I stopped the Metropol, lately I am feeling increased heart rate. It can be anywhere from 85 to 110, etc..... I am not sure if this is my anxiety playing games, but it can be rather annoying. I'm trying to cut down on the caffeine and will start adding exercise into my daily life style. I just see the little things that bother me, like for example. I am building my house and notice where I am staying now, I am living at a house and my room is on the 3rd Floor. When I get to the top of 3rd, I notice my heart beating harder and faster for a few seconds and slowly calms down. It worries me but it all seems normal. I am not sure if I am giving this too much thought. And to finally add to the end of the story and sorry for going ALL over, I am not the best story teller. I am noticing when sleeping I am waking up with neck pain. I did have an MRI on my neck (I might open a new thread for that under neck issues) but I do have a herniated disc (I think 2) and they said I would need to do some physical therapy. I plan to do something about that, but I'm just getting hit all over the place with these issues! Please give me your thoughts, of maybe someone has the same issues or some like me.To recap: I am a 30 year old male, 5'6, ~242lbs.As of now I am on Lorstan 25MG and do have klonopin as needed. I did try PPIs for my stomach but had to stop due to headaches, so do take Zantac/2x a day, but not sure if this is contributing to my headaches?Please help!"

Much appreciated.I am terrible with dates so forgive me. Roughly I don’t know about 4-5 months ago I went into my gynecologist for my yearly exam. While I was there I mentioned to her that I was having some weird side effects from my birth control pills (I’ve been on the pill since I was 15, I just turned 30 and am a healthy weight) She suggested I try another type of pill and I was happy to do so. So, I start the new pill, all is well. I go in for another visit, just a checkup on how the new pills are going. I tell her they are awesome and I’m very happy with them. She takes my blood pressure while I’m there and it was stroke level baddddd. I have never had an issue with blood pressure and it was fine at my yearly exam prior. The only thing that had changed was the new bc pills so she suggested we do some blood work to rule some stuff out which I did. My blood work came back fine and she put me on some calcium channel blockers to try to get it down while we figured out what to do. A month goes by I’m still on the bc and bp pills, my bp was not going down so she added a beta blocker and diuretics. At this time I’m taking 2 diuretics, 2 calcium channel blockers and a beta blocker a day. I finally decide okay time to quit the pill, so I did. She told me to stay on the bp meds and let’s wait and see if it goes down. I went in for weekly visits to monitor it as well as checking it myself at home. It did start to go down to a reasonable number. Here I am currently off the bc pills for a month, still taking all of these bp meds. I’m monitoring my bp like a crazy person because I’m so desperate to get off all these pills. Yesterday I totally forgot to take them and out of curiosity I checked my bp and it was perfect! I haven’t seen it that low since before all this started and it stayed low and awesome all day and night. Well today I decided to not take the pills on purpose so I could see what my bp did and it was great and normal again! However, I’m a good patient and wasn’t able to get ahold of my doctor today for advice so I decided to go ahead and take my pills like I’ve been told to. After I took them my bp has pretty much stayed the same and on some readings it’s actually higher then when I didn’t take them. My doctor wants my top bp number to be at least 90 before I stop taking the pills but it just is not lowering anymore. Can anyone give me some advice here? It seems so crazy! I plan to call the doctors office tomorrow in an attempt to explain this but I’m just so confused. ANY advice or help would be SO greatly appreciated you don’t even know. My family and friends are so over hearing about this and I’ve googled until my eyes hurt to no avail. Thank you so much for reading this book LOL"

I wondered if anyone has had the same problems taking amlipodene or Ramipril and have changed to something else that suits them? I have been naughty and missed my tablet last night as I felt pretty rough. I'm sure I feel better today actually feeling hungry for the first time in ages. I will take a tablet tonight though.

I was lying on the couch, watching a movie, when my vision suddenly went wonky on me. It's always the left eye only, but since I lose half my sight, it just seems like it messes with both eyes. If I close my left eye, though, I can see out of my right eye okay. When my eyesight starts going like that, I get dizzy, lightheaded, and feel like I'm going to pass out. I get a tightness in my chest and get short of breath. And I just feel uncomfortable. I don't know how to explain it, just uncomfortable.I feel relaxed before hand, and it just hits out of nowhere. However, tonight I had noticed that I was having a lot of skipped beats prior to it. I can't remember if I was having the skipped beats prior the other other times. I've had this happen about 4 or 5 times over the past 3 months. It's not done it either time that I've gone to the ER, so tonight, I decided I wanted to get a record of my BP and P while it was going on, to share with the cardiologist on the 20th. Since these just hit out of nowhere, and they don't happen frequently like this, I thought it was important to document during the episode. I'm always relaxed before hand, but when my vision starts going like that, and I get lightheaded and feel like I'm going to pass out, that always scares me a little. I don't say anything when it's going on, because I don't want to worry my kids, so I just lie there until it passes. My BP was fine during the episode (which lasted about 1/2 an hour), but my pulse wasn't.

My BP right now is 137/80 and pulse is 100 irregular. I have a headache and have had one since it stopped, which has been 5 hours ago. I'm also not sure what the ""irregular"" means on my BP cuff, as I accidentally threw it away the manual when I got it. :-/ I'm always so freaking tired anymore. I have absolutely no energy. I do enough to get through my jobs, but everything at the house is falling apart because I can't get the energy together to get everything done that I need to get done. Then, when I do find the energy, I get short of breath easily, my heart starts racing, and I'm wore out quickly. Please just let this be stress. I can deal with stress. Though, I will say that my BP has been elevated recently (for me). I have vasovagal syncope, and my BP has always been low, but it's been getting in the 140s/90s, 150s/100s. My BP has never gone that high before. So, anyone hear of anything like this? Can this just be anxiety or stress? "
"Hypertension","Changing BP medication","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/changing-bp-medication-673884","Hello everyone,I am after a bit of advice, after two years of misery I went to my GP yesterday and asked to change my bp medication, I am currently taking 10 mgs of Amlodopine which gives me ringing in my ears all the time. I have been changed of to 5 mgs (she wants to start on a low dose) of Lisinopril, suggesting that I take only 5 mgs of Amlolopine and the Linsinopril together for two weeks and then stop the Amlodopine.

"Hypertension","furosemide for hypertension","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/furosemide-for-hypertension-673306","Dear Forum,In 2012 my then GP prescribed me Amlodipine 5 mg for my high blood pressure, which reduced my systolic blood pressure to around 140 Hgmm.In 2013 I was taken to hospital with spinal injuries, and presumably because doctors there had found that Amlodipine did not work well for me, they added Furosemide.40 mg to my high blood pressure regimen. It resulted in my blood pressure's dropping to 120-130 Hgmm. I felt really great.In 2016 I changed my residence, and a GP at another health centre arbitraryly, and without warning me that his taking me off Furosemide would lead to an increase in my blood pressure, and saying that Furosemide will dry up my kidneys, took me off Furosemide and increased my Amlodipine dosage to 10 mg. My blood pressure went up. I blame myself for not resisting him aalthough I was not sure if I could insist on keeping the status quo. Another GP at the same medical centre, to whom last December I complained that because of my not being on Furosemide, I was now suffering from headaches, ignored my request for Furosemide.On 08.08.2018 I saw yet another GP, who despite the fact that on the first reading my systolic blood pressure was 159 Hgmm, and on the second it went down to only 149 Hgmm, and that he could see for himself how badly high blood pressure affected my balance too, did not restore me to Furosemide.I think that increase in my high blood pressure is caused by water retention. I have difficulties passing water. This explains why Furosemide had worked for me, and Amlopidine, even in a higher dose, does not.I need an advice on what to do. I want to avoid any confrontation with doctors at my health centre, but on the other hand, just because I am too polite, I do not relish a prospect of having a stroke,Yours faithfully,jozsef81284 "

No one’s day to day life is like that. if high bp is dangerous it shouldnt matter what you are doing with a few exceptions like exercising at gym.I can understand doing it to establish a level to check whether trend is up or down but to determine your actual bp it all seems at bit false to me.Certainly at the doctors they bever do that and when you wear a 24hr ambulatory device you are exoected to go about your day to day activities which makes sense to me."

"Hypertension","New to Group","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/new-to-group-672439","I am a 52 year old woman with history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolisms, vasovagal syncope, and hypotension. So I find myself intrigued that I am now joining a group to talk about hypertension. Approximately 2 to 3 months ago, I had an episode while I was out driving (between clients) and was in the middle of nowhere. I felt a bad pain in my back, around my shoulder blades, right shoulder and along my jaw line, then felt a pressure in my chest. I actually was adjusting my clothing, thinking that it was somehow causing that pressure in my chest. I called work and asked them to look up symptoms of a heart attack for a woman. Since I was in the middle of nowhere, no traffic, and I had no way to tell anyone where I was at, I kept driving. The pain and tightness lasted about 20 + minutes. Finally, it stopped. Ever since then, though, I've been having daily episodes of skipped heart beats. On occasion I will feel a tightness in my chest. This has resulted in 2 ER visits and one Urgent Care (though they referred me to the ER instead of seeing me). 1st visit at ER I went, everything had stopped before I got taken to the back and they didn't find anything. They told me to follow up with my regular doctor.Problem is, right now I do not have insurance. I fall in that grey area, make too much for assistance, but not enough to pay out of pocket with a pre-existing condition. I haven't been on my blood thinners for a couple of years, and haven't been to a doctor in that long. My blood pressure has been fine through all of this, at least I thought it had. BP was fine at the ER, slightly elevated at the second visit. However, I bought a blood pressure / pulse monitor because I wanted to keep track of things. The 2nd ER has referred me to a cardiologist, which I will see on the 20th. I was taking my blood pressure today and it has ranged from 122/89 to 132/108 and 152/92. Since, in 52 years, I've never had a blood pressure that high, I'm wondering how concerned I should be about this. My pulse is averaging about 90 but has gone as high as 132. My monitor has indicated several episodes of irregular heartbeat. The 2nd ER doctor put me on Xarelto. It has the added bonus of keeping me from developing new clots. Some of the other symptoms I have gotten in these past 3 months is when I'm getting the skipped beats, a few times my vision was impacted in my left eye. I have heard my pulse beating in my left ear and one day felt like my head and face were pounding along with my pulse and I could hear it in both ears. Having never dealt with high blood pressure, I don't know what to do when it gets elevated. I know what to do for low blood pressure, but this is a new experience for me.I don't know if this has anything to do with it, but my sleep has been extremely sporadic during this time, too. I'll wake up several times a night and now I find myself waking up early and not being able to get back to sleep. What should I do to prepare for the cardiologist? How many times a day should I keep track of BP and Pulse to give to the cardiologist? I've been taking it every time my heart skips a beat. Thank you for any information."

I also recently had a stress echo that I didn’t feel was necessary for undiagnosed chest pain.

I think I was on Prozac when I had the better reading. Would that have handled my stress enough to keep it down that much? Or could it be anxiety? I don’t have a lot of salt intake and I don’t drink caffeine. I eat fairly healthy. Nothing I’ve done should’ve changed it that much in such a short time I feel."
"Hypertension","Off my BP meds with a better diet - yippee!","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/off-my-bp-meds-with-a-better-diet-yippee--663479","Hi Guys,Thanks to everyone who give me advice over the last year or so about my high BP.I just wanted to post to say I am off my BP meds now because I changed my diet and lost a little weight. So, if I can do it, then I am sure many people in this group can do the same without relying on medications long term. Of course, everyone is different so different types of diets will work for different types of people. For me, I was pretty drastic, I cut out pretty much all processed foods along with dairy and anything with animal products in them. I eat lots of potatoes, veggies and fruit. I have also cut out all oils including olive oil. My BP was never crazy high like some people but it was high enough to be put on BP medication for over a year. My highest reading at the docs was about 180/90, eventually meds (Olmersartan) got it down to about 130/80. My doc always said my meds were a low dose but even so, I never felt great being on them and hated the idea of been on them for the rest of my life when I was only 47yrs old.I will stick with my current diet for sometime as I need to lose 50kgs to get down to a reasonable weight for my height. I do intend to slowly put some foods back in my diet but a LOT less then I ate before! BTW, when I first started my diet I had not been checking my BP but when I did after 2 weeks of being on it, my BP had dropped to 105/74! I was then checking twice daily and it was still around similar readings so I went to visit my GP who put me on a 24 hrs monitor and when I got the results, the doctor says no need for meds no more!! My readings now off the meds average probably around 110/75. It is still early days but hopefully if I continue the diet and lose more weight then it will stay the same similar readings.I hope this helps some of you guys and thanks again to everyone who helped me deal with high BP over the last year or so. Good luck!!"

It didn't bother me at the time but over the weekend the pain grew so I couldn't lie comfortably in bed so I went to the doctors. He said I had strained my ribs and it was typical that the pain got worse over a few days and it could take weeks to get fully better. However, he said I had high blood pressure and was concerned and sent me for an ECG, told me to cut salt out of my diet for 2 days and then go back for another blood pressure check. I did this - the blood pressure was still high and the nurse got me straight in to see a doctor who put me on 1.25mg of Rampril once a day and was told to go back in 2 weeks unless I experienced pains in my chest (which I pointed out may be difficult to spot with the current rib strain). I borrowed a blood pressure monitor and have been monitoring the blood pressure morning and night and it hasn't lowered. Two days ago my doctor rang and said that he had my blood sample results back and they were fine but he also had my ECG and though I shouldn't be concerned he wanted me to have an ultrasound on my heart which would take a few weeks. As my blood pressure was unchanged I should double the dose of Rampril. I have done this and so far nothing has changed though I have only been on double for 2 nights.Now - all my life I have had no issue with blood pressure. I had a medical last September and 2 incidents in A&E this year for minor head injuries, the latest being 2 months ago all of which included a blood pressure test... so I know it was fine very recently. I am certainly not overweight, eat quite healthily, have never smoked, go off hiking most weekends and as mentioned my bloods are fine. Naturally I am a bit of a worrier but actually I am less stressed this last year than I have been in my life (in my view).I am a bit concerned that given I know I was 'fine' 2 months ago I do wonder what other things it could be. The only external factor I can see is this rib strain I have which has improved a lot in the last week. The ECG seems to have shown something up though but I could be waiting weeks for this ultrasound. Can strains cause damage to the heart?"

Raised BP, Anxious, Stressed or Doc says vertigo, really?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/whats-going-on-raised-bp-anxious-stressed-or-doc-says-vertigo-really--655818","Me - Im 35, male,tall, slightly overweight but not too much very active, lots of sports, good diet loving husband and and great daddy to a 6 year old! No illnesses apart from the very occasional anxiety spell when Im overseas or out of comfort zone etc... maybe 2 a year for 5 mins. I had liposuction 4 weeks ago on my chest, (gynecomastia op).. wearing a very tight compression vest at the minute, 4 weeks in, another 4 to go until it can come off.... OK, thats me,..Enough about me....Recent events - Wife had minor heart attack in February, didn't notice it, taken to docs cos her bp was very high, taken to hospital, stent in her ventricle out 5 days later. Shes fit, healthy, never smoked, doesn't drink heavily, not really in family either. 4 weeks after coming out she had a TIA. Jeees WTF?!!!... another 5 days in hospital. Shes fine now.....Thank god!. 3 weeks ago I was sat at my desk at work writing an email. (im a stress-head might need to add). I was typing an email and got hit by a dizzy spell, nearly knocked me off my chair!... For no reason!,...Thought it would pass, it didnt. That evening still slightly dizzy and a headache. ( i never get those). Same the following day and couldn't concentrate, pain in back of head moving to front of eyes repeatedly. I went to A & E.My BP was 190/110!! They gave me a diazepam and a Cortizone jab. Told me it was stress at work and waited till BP came down and sent me home.Following day, same, back to A&E, doc says I might have developed hypertension having been through such a tough time lately with the wife, gave me enalapril 10mg, blood test - normal, ecograph, ecg, normal, xray and ultrasound - normal. Did a weird finger test and said my eyes flickered to the right and diagnosed me with Peripheral Vertigo, gave me Betahistine twice a day and told me to make appt with GP and write my BP results down 3 times a day.3 days later, betahistine has had no affect on the dizziness and I have now developed unprovoked anxiety panic attacks! (What the he'll are they? - Horrible). Sat at home in bed, sat in a restaurant, 2/3 times a day.. for no reason?.....3 days after that, the dizziness seems to have subsided slightly and I cant stand these panick moments so I binned the Betahistine to see if that was the potential cause, low and behold, touch wood, I havent had an anxiety attack since (maybe just coincidence), is this a side effect??Went to GP a week later with BP results, average 160/95 morning, 158/95 afternoon and same in the evening. GP changed BP tablets to Ramapril 5mg once a day and gave me Lorazepam 1mg for the panic attacks and said I was OK to have them one a day and may also help with the dizziness and BP. I also (for my sins) have a few wines every night pretty much to destress and chill. (ive always done that) I told the doc and she said it isnt ideal obviously but to me its better than benzos?? OK so here we are today.. I havent taken the Lorazepam as theres only one of us working here and I need to be sharp. BUT I AM NOT! My BP is still 150/90 all the day on average and either the dizziness or fuzziness has reduced somewhat or I have just begun to handle it better. (I meant to say, I have zero appetite either with the headaches)I have a permanent headache now (mainly around the crown area). I struggle to focus on anything, my work is suffering, I feel like my head is going to explode all the time, Im tired more than usual, I struggle to laugh, im just not myself at all. I feel like Im sat next to me and my body is just going through the motions... quite sad really..... My little girl is beautiful, work is going well, Im not depressed (I dont think I am anyway), my wife is fine now and although yes it has been awful start to the year, she is genuinely doing well and I cant simply put all this down to stress, I just cant, it just sounds wrong.Appreciate this is information overload!!, but I needed to get this out. Any feedback or thoughts much appreciates. Just nice to have someone to talk too.....Adam. "

Currently on a ACH inhibitor, so I haven’t NOT been taking anything for my high BP. Has anyone had this problem going off beta-blockers and will the withdrawal symptoms ever go away?? When my heart used to pound that fast before I was taking beta blockers (from anxiety or stress) it didn’t take much for it to slow down. But it’s been hours and it’s been fluctuating in between 110-124 BPM. I don’t know if it’s because the fact that it is beating so fast that’s not helping it come down or what. Either way, I am worried and annoyed. No chest pain. No problem breathing. I didn’t have any problem with my heart before the beta blockers but I’m afraid that problems may develop them since I’ve stopped them. I’m so mad at myself for not defeating these things when my doctor first talked about prescribing them.

"Hypertension","Feeling terrible from lowered bp after incredibly high bp for years","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/feeling-terrible-from-lowered-bp-after-incredibly-high-bp-for-years-645748","Long post coming up - sorry! I'm a female & 46 years old. On February 2 I went to the ER because I was losing vision in my right eye. I was terrified. They discovered that my blood pressure was 270/150. They treated me, got the bp down a little and sent me home (crazy!). I visited an eye doctor that day and he said that I had suffered an eye stroke in my right eye due to uncontrolled high blood pressure. Back story, I'd been diagnosed with high bp about eight years ago but quit taking my meds because I didn't like my doctor. I felt fine so I figured it was fine. Dumb! So anyhow, we're assuming my bp has been incredibly high all these years. So, fast forwarded back to February. The next morning my bp was rising again and I was concerned so we went back to the ER. They admitted me that time, thankfully, and I was there for about four days. My bp seemed to be getting under control with the medication they put me on and it was 158/99 when they released me. Still high but much better.I was placed on 2 bp meds - Carvedilol 25 MG twice a day & Amlodipine 10 MG once a day - and told to follow up with a hypertension specialist and my family doctor. I also purchased a bp monitor and began taking my bp various times throughout the day. After a few weeks it was obvious the medication was working for sure because I was averaging about 125/82, sometimes much lower too.Unfortunately, I was feeling rotten. I was sleeping 12 to 13 hours at night and still needed two or three naps throughout the day. When I was awake I felt like a complete zombie. Miserable. I had an appointment with the specialist on February 27. He said that the reason I was feeling so awful was because my body was trying to adjust to my bp being so much lower after being so incredibly high for so many years. He decided to raise my bp up to about 140/90 in hopes that I'd feel better. In order to do that he cut my Carvedilol down to 12.5 MG twice a day but left the Amlodipine the same. He said if that didn't work we'd cut the Amlodipine down to 5 MG once a day too.Well, it worked.....kind of. My bp is still only averaging about 130/85, sometimes alittle higher or lower. But hardly ever even close to 140/90. I'm able to stay awake more but I still feel rotten. I'm tired and weak all the time. I have some dizziness and feel out of breath sometimes. Plus my brain just feels ""foggy"" all the time. I'm frustrated!I finally had an appointment with my family doctor on March 19 (she'd had an emergency and wasn't available for quite some time). She thinks I'm okay the way I am. She wants to keep the meds the same and thinks I need to start walking on the treadmill. I am overweight and know I need to lose weight but right now the idea of walking on a treadmill is crazy to me. I'm so tired all the time. I'm lucky to stay awake and carry on a conversation.I'm seriously considering cutting the Amlodipine down to 5 MG once a day to see if that will help. I""m thinking it'll get me closer to the 140/90 goal that my specialist wants. Plus I've read a lot that Amlodipine can be very sedating. I'll be monitoring my bp closely and if it rises too high I'll go back to taking the 10 MG. I'm just curious if any of you have had this type of thing. Have any of you lost vision in one of your eyes due to high bp? My vision still hasn't come back, by the way. The doctors say it may but it may not, they don't really know. And, also, have any of you experienced a situation like mine where you had incredibly high bp for a long time & have now lowered it significantly? Did you feel rotten all the time? How long did it take for you body to adjust to the lower bp? "

"Hypertension","BP Massive Variations","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/bp-massive-variations-657441","Long story short(ish). I was told I had raised BP several years ago, typically around 145/85 and was put on Candersartan. I bought a home BP machine and for 2-3 years never really saw much of difference in it. There were times it would come down to 120/80 but generally it was at best 135/80.Then about 18 months - 2 years ago I bought a larger cuff for my machine as I always found the one that came with the machine a little tight. This made a massive difference and my BP was always 120/80 or 110/80. Only then did I realise the importance of getting the right size cuff!Anyway, whenever I saw my GP they would test my BP and the results they got where always a lot higher typically around 155/95 but I would explain that whenever I test it at home it's 120/80 to which they would say that they trust home readings and that they know I have white coat syndrome and suffer from anxiety anyway.One of things with my anxiety is I get ectopic heartbeats, these come and go but for the past 2 months I've been getting them a lot. I know that if I take a beta blocker they go away so a month ago I went to my GP explained the situation and asked for some beta blockers that I could take on days when I was getting lots of ectopic beats. The doctor agreed but said to be careful about taking them with candersartan incase it lowered my BP too much.I then found that if I took the beta blockers I got no ectopic beats but if I stopped they returned so in the end I stopped taking candersartan and just took the beta blockers.So yesterday I go to see my GP, explain I'd stopped taking candersartan and that I had now run out of beta blockers so could I have some more. She said that she was a bit concerned about stopping candersartan as it's better at lowering BP than a beta blocker and took my BP.It was the highest I've ever seen it 165/111. I explained that when I take it at home it's 120/80 and so she asked me to take my BP twice a day for a week. Seeing that high reading really freaked me out and I've struggled to get it out of my mind ever since.Anyway, when I got home yesterday I took my BP and it was 125/85. Later that day I was reading up about BP and found that you are meant to recalibrate your machines every 2 years. This freaked me out a bit as mine is probably 7 years old and so I started to worry that my machine was wrong and the readings at the GP were in fact correct. I ordered a new machine there and then which arrived today. It's a much better machine, Omron M3 Comfort but when I took a reading it shocked me as it was coming up as 155/105. I took 3 readings all about the same. I then switched back to my old machine that always tells me it's 120/80. This time though it couldn't even give me a reading as the BP was so high. After several attempts it too said something like 150/100.Since then I've taken 2 sets of 3 readings with the new machine, averaging 159/105 with one as high as 171/110. Switching to the old machine it was coming up as 160/104.I now have no idea what to believe other than I know I'm now anxious, very anxious. Is my BP really around 155/100 and all those readings of 120/80 I've been getting were down to an old incorrect machine? If so why does the old machine also now give me high readings?I guess it could be the effect of stopping Candersartan but I'm only on 1x 16mg tablet and I took my BP at the weekend just 2 days before seeing the GP and then it was 120/80 so how has it jumped 40 points systolic and 20 points diastolic in just 3 days?Equally how this morning at 9am was I getting 120/80 and yet just now at 10pm I'm getting 152/100?I just don't know what to do or believe and, as I'm sure you can tell, I'm freaking out which obviously isn't helping matters either."

"Hypertension","High Diastolic Pressure when active","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/high-diastolic-pressure-when-active-656426","Recently I've been experiencing a feeling of unwellness when active - even just slow paced walking. I feel weak, shaky, my hands and face feel numb and tingly, nausea, dry mouth, sweating etc. I started taking my blood pressure readings after walking or even standing and my blood pressure is high, particularly my diastolic pressure. It's consistently above 90 and I've seen it as high as 121. When I'm lying down, by pressure is pretty consistently 120/80. It's just when I move about. Even sitting in a chair seems to escalate my BP. I saw my doctor yesterday after getting a really bad episode. He's at a loss and my reasing was normal with him, but he referred me to get a 24 hour ambulatory BP monitor. However, it's not for a couple weeks.From what I've read, Diastolic BP shouldn't fluctuate too much - if anything, it should decrease during activity, so this is what's got me concerned. I have anxiety, but in the past, during anxiety attacks I've only seen my diastolic go into the low 90's. I don't feel like I'm having any serious anxiety lately, and I feel like I'm physically able to feel the spike in BP. I guess where I'm in the dark is understanding what normal fluctuations in BP are under exercise and stress/anxiety. What's dangerous? How concerned should I be? I'm on 1.25mg Bisoprol that I started taking for arrhythmia, but I'm thinking of upping to 2.5 because of the recent high BP. "

Quick background is that I am 28 y/o, and I have had elevated blood pressure ever since my 20's. It fluctuates widely - for the most part, I average around 130/70 on a consistent basis. Whenever I am truly relaxed and stress free, it will go down to 120/65. However, I have had a very stressful job and very stressful career, so I take my BP while I'm at work during my breaks, and it will shoot up to 140/85, sometimes even 150/85 whenever I give a presentation or during a very stressful time at work. However, after about a good 5 minutes of just breathing and relaxing, it will go back down to between 125/65 to 130/70. I do this on almost a daily basis and have figured out the trend that yes, my job is stressful, and yes, I need to learn to somehow manage my stress while I'm at work.Also want to add that I was a good 35 pounds overweight. I shedded 35 pounds which has definitely helped. I am 5 feet 9 inches, and my current weight is 160 lb (normal range). I am trying to drop another 10-20 pounds to help with my blood pressure, because I really want to stay below the 120/70 threshold. Ideally, I would like my BP in the realm of 110/70 on a daily basis. I have read too much about how high BP is a major issue and therefore have taken the necessary steps to really keep it down as much as possible. I have been dieting and exercising everyday, which definitely helps with it. However, the hardest part right now is keeping my BP down while I'm at work due to a stressful job (a lot of thinking, programming, math, solving complex problems, etc). This is something I need to somehow manage. Also, I would like to add I do have anxiety issues and stress myself out a lot pretty easily. I've been seeing a therapist to help with my anxiety because its definitely affecting my health and BP.I have gone to numerous doctors about this issue (i.e. a cardiologist and my primary care physician doctor). I've passed all the tests (EKG, echocardiogram, stress test, etc). Both doctors passed me as a healthy 28 y/o. However, it really disturbs me that my BP can peak up to 140 to 150 systolic while I'm at work. I don't see how this will be sustainable in the long run if my BP keeps peaking this high while I work on a daily basis. Is there a cause for concern? I know me worrying about this issue definitely doesn't help my BP either. The fact that I am pretty young and my systolic averages between 130 to 140 systolic has got me worried. Any advice would be appreciated, thank you. "

I am 5'4 135 pounds. I walk 5.5 miles most days and except for occasional issues from GERD, have not had to take any medicines. My BP has been consistently low/normal my entire life. I have always impressed the doctors with my consistent low/normal BP. It is usually between 110/70; 117/70; 110/60 and some days 123/80.Two weeks ago at a visit to my doctors office my BP was 159/79. I couldn't believe it. They took it again and it was 147/79 They took it the third time and it was 157/82. I left the office depressed. I had to go back to the doctor this past Monday (3-12-18) and I was trying to be calm and not worry but my BP was 165/91. I just got very depressed. My doctor is baffled because while he's a new doctor, on all of my visits over the last year my BP has been normal, as it has been all my life. He suggested I get a monitor and monitor my BP for a week and bring it in so they can compare and see how it goes. If not, he says I have to take BP medicine. I have cut way way back on my salt intake. I admit I never worried about sodium because I had such low BP and I liked the taste. The week after my first reading I cut way back on salt, and reading labels more carefully for sodium. I cut back to one diet pepsi every three days and while I do have two cups of coffee in the morning, thats it for me and I have always had 2 cops of coffee. I eat mostly chicken or fish. I cook fresh vegetables for dinner every night and brown rice or lentils. I thought I was doing well.I was just wondering if anyone has any words of wisdom for me. Thank you."

Why?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/extreme-diastollic-pressure-when-standing-why--647554","Hi everyone,Some time ago I opened a thread to ask about my unexplained diastollic pressure, usually happening in the evenings.Since a couple weeks I noticed I also have an extreme Diastolic pressure when I am standing upright. Strangely the Systolic pressure doesn't change when I stand, this stays between 130 and 140, which is alright for me.But the lower pressure rises to 105-115 range, I start to feel it too, pressure buildup in my head, my heart I can quite literally feel in my brain (???)No doctor has been able to explain yet why this happens when I stand/walk, and to be frank, it is all draining me quite a bit. I feel like a walking time bomb because I feel the lower pressure is dangerously high.When I measure my BP standing upright it can be 130/110. I sit down and a mere 2 mins later it already sinks down to 130/94, still high, but more acceptable.Does anyone know of a reason, or is experiencing the same problem?My current medication list is: Amlodipine 5 mgLisinopril 20 mgMetoprolol (Beta blocker) 47,5 extended releaseHydrochloorthiazide (diuretica) I am based in the Netherlands, female (31) and overweight.Any feedback/help/tips/support great appreciated !"

I have been to heart ultrasound, ECG, kidney ultrasound, blood test, and everywhere they told me that i am fine, and i have no problem doing physical excersise, so conclusion, i dont have hard physical symptoms.However, i have been having problems with my blood pressure. 3 years ago they did a 24-hour measuring, and the midday average came out 150/90 with once above 170 , but at night it was often below 110/70, so they put me on low dose ACE inhibitor. It didnt seem to have much effect so i dropped it and didnt measure my blood pressure for a year or so due to some personal issues. Around 1 year ago I went to a cardiologist who did a stress test (had to ride the bike) and found my bp to pike at 190/90, but told me as long as at home i measure normal readings i shouldnt take medicine. So I'm attaching a picture of a diagram of the readings i've been having for the past 2 months. They seem fine i know, but when i go to the doctors, its always around 150/90, and one month ago i had tonsillectomy and i was very nervous beforehand, and they measured 197/95 ( after 20 min it went down to 145/90 ) but there they told me that i should take it seriously.Sorry for long story, i have been to multiple doctors who had different opinions, one said that i should take medicine to prevent my vessels from damaging, others said i am fine its just white coat and stress. I have been obsessing over it and its starting to effect my personal life too, so i was wondering if someone with experience would share theirs with me. "

A little background. About 7 years ago I went in to my GP to have a prostate exam with the old glove and lube. When the nurse took my BP it was 210/118. She left the reading on a stickie on the office door for my GP to see when she came in to see me. When my GP cam in and saw it she took my reading again. It was still high. SHe immediately slapped me on Coversyl and a water pill and sent me on my way. No going home with a home monitor No hospital for tests. Just meds and home.I read my BP at home and could always get it down to 120's / 80's after about 5 or 6 reading. one day I read it and it was 170 over 95 and I got fed up.. Havent read it since. Now in the 7 or so years over time. I have come down with Erectile Dysfunction....Vision Problems and Gout. All side effects of the drugs. WHen I asked her to switch my meds she said she liked the meds I was on and gave me a prescription for Viagra. When I used to come in with my readings 120's over 80's, she would tell me we could get them lower. Now I am going to be 60 this year. I am tired of worrying about my BP. She never explained that at my age 140's over 90's is ok... Gotta get it lower.. Im tired of worrying about my weight.. What I eat ... What I drink.. I want my life back.. and all the side effects... Im done.. She asked me to take 2 readings a day for one month before I come into see her... THat is 60 readings.. to see if we can lower the meds.. Who has the time for that.So I have decided I think .. that in 2 weeks when I go into see her.. I am going to start over to see what my BP really is in a relaxed environment and then providing on what meds I need.. to switch the meds so dont get the bad side effects.. or I am switching doctors.. I dont like the way this whole situation has been handled.. and there have been other issues as well. I have lost some trust in her.. Any opinions.. "

The surgery was a success, I’ve stadotoof checkups and taken my meds (including BP meds). I’m concerned about the elevated readings even at home. I just finished a echocardiogram, the dr said every thing was normal. But he expressed concern over the elevated BP and increased one of the meds.

I was sent home with Lisinopril and that was that. I bought a home meter because it got me worried. I started measuring and slowly but steadily the BP went down, the GP added Amlodipine, but as a result I started getting palpitations, problems with my heart rate, it kept being far too high. Metoprolol retard was added and my BP was perfect for a good week. Now since 4 days I’m having a new problem.

I went to my doctor about two days after the initial attack when I realized my anxiety was more intense then it's ever been before, the first time I went my blood pressure was fine (125/81), fast forward four days I went in again for a follow up due to my medication reacting to me poorly and my blood pressure spiked to 150/84. I've always had a huge fear of feeling my heart beat along with doctors checking my blood pressure in general so this wasn't to shocking for my doctor to see it spike, especially with the state of mind I was in. A couple more appointments go by within the same month and my blood pressure was jumping around, ranged from 128/80-150/80 with the highest spike being 160/84. My doctor didn't really seem to be to worried about it because I informed him I was at the verge of a panic attack each time I was in the office.Fast forward to today, my Dad who is 63 just got diagnosed with Hypertension (It started rather recently) and it drove my health anxiety off the charts, I began to backtrack on those appointments and began to worry ""What if I have hypertension, I'm going to die!, etc"" yanno, all those fun anxious thoughts. My girlfriend has a blood pressure machine (Don't know the exact name of them) at home and I decided to check my blood pressure, the first reading was 148/86, I was extremely nervous at the time because like I stated before I hate taking my blood pressure in general, I decided to lay down and relax for roughly 20 minutes before taking it agian..Once I was relaxed (well as relaxed as I could get) I took it again and got a reading of 138/87 which put me at ease, however it's still borderline Hypertension.It's nearly impossible for me to remain calm and get an accurate reading, especially within the past week or so due to my hypochondriac self coming out full blown. I'm worried I have Hypertension, especially at a young age. My cholesterol is borderline high as well (Mainly due to high Triglycerides), my diet and laziness is to blame. However I've been changing my diet for the better (Veggies, Fruits, No more Soda, cut down on smoking to the point I only have 2 throughout the day...YES I KNOW I SHOULD QUIT COMPLETELY) and I've been exercising (push-ups, sit ups, going on walks, jumping jacks etc). Basically what I came here for is for advice on what to do / hoping that someone can put my mind to ease...I've found many studies that Anxiety can cause high blood pressure spikes and what not so I'm hoping that's the main cause of my high readings. I've been seeing a Psychiatrist for the past 7-8 months and I've made a lot of progress with my mental health since, however the Panic Disorder still strongly affects my every day life. I'm not on medication at the moment because my doctor believes I am able to beat this on my own and not have to rely on medication which I strongly agree with."

"Hypertension","extremely high BP out of the blue","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/extremely-high-bp-out-of-the-blue-635074","Hi, I'm a 35-year-old active male. I'm 140lbs and 5'9"". While I've traditionally eaten a lot of sodium and sweets, my diet has only gotten healthier over the last year or two. I have never had blood pressure problems in my life, and neither of my parents has high blood pressure (though one died from a cerebral hemorrhage in a part of the brain normally attributed to high blood pressure). But my grandmother on my mother's side has longstanding high blood pressure, sometimes with really high readings, and is medicated. She also claims to have ""white coat hypertension"".About six months ago my doctor noticed that my blood pressure was periodically a tad high. So, he had me take it at home for a month and come back with the numbers. They were pretty normal, so he didn't worry. Then my dad died unexpectedly from a cerebral hemorrhage, and he wanted to play it safe, and had me do it again. At first, the numbers were unremarkable -- 135/90, say. But within a couple of days they got very high -- 157/109, 160/110, 180/94, 144/120, etc. I went back to my doctor who thought I had developed an extreme form of white coat hypertension, or, anyway, fear of taking my blood pressure. So, he had me do a 24-hour test. Lo and behold, the numbers were consistently very high -- as high as 206 on the top and 126 on the bottom. He concluded that I really do have hypertension, albeit sudden and extreme onset, and that it is likely secondary. So, he is scheduling me to get an MRI to test for renal stenosis and pheochromocytoma. He also put me on Bystolic 10mg, and, since taking it, my blood pressure was 141/101 when I tested it. He wants to try other blood pressure medications too, but says that they will interfere with the MRI, so is holding off.My questions are as follows. First, do any of you have stories like this? Could this just be ""primary"" hypertension? My grandmother suggested that her story is much like mine. But I find that hard to believe.Second, could stress be responsible for numbers like these? I am under a lot of stress. My dad only died about 3 months ago, and it was unexpected. I am also under a pressing deadline on a major project at the end of February. I have always been a very anxious person, but this has never appeared to affect my blood pressure.Third, given how high my numbers are, is it safe for me to be out and about, living my life? I have been getting headaches, but I can't tell if they're stress/anxiety related instead. I have refrained from exercise since the numbers started being at ER levels (despite the doctor's earlier suggestion to exercise as normal). Any other thoughts or suggestions?Thanks, in advance! "

I'm underweight, not overweight, never drink or smoke, eat mostly grain, veggies and a little fish with low salt, hike in the hills regularly, semi-retired, low stress life with daily meditation, definitely don't fit the profile for hypertension. Go figure Anyway, I've recently read about studies that show a few disconcerting conclusions about BP meds, such as:- they frequently don't work, even with 3 combined meds (ACE, Calcium Chain + diuretic)- they work for awhile but then stop, and reconfiguring meds/doses doesn't help much- some studies have shown they actually increase, rather than decrease, rate of heart-attack/strokes in takers, as a side effect, even if the numbers seem to go down- other studies show the rate of heart attack/stroke in people who ran high numbers for any length of time, then successfully brought the numbers down with the meds, had just as many heart attacks/strokes as those who never brought their numbers down, indicating that once the vascular damage is done, even if meds successfully lower your numbers from that point on, it makes little difference to the damaged veins, heart and organsObviously, if any of those points are accurate, the BP drug-makers don't want you to know, so some of these studies seem hard to locate, but I've seen 'emSo I'm interested in the latest accurate info about these points, from people who really know.

This is my first day taking it and most of my symptoms from high blood pressure went away besides I have a heart beat in my left ear that came back after two hours of taking the medicine. I thought it was due to my high BP 138/90 (23F 5foot tall and 138 pounds) but it returned so maybe it isn't? Does it take a few days to really kick in and take away all of the symptoms? I've never had to take any medications before until now. And for some reason my left hand feels prickly and the veins seem to be sticking out a little more than normal. I'm not sure how I feel about this medicine yet.Thanks "

"Hypertension","Changing pressure meds","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/changing-pressure-meds-630453","Hey, guys. I’m 22 years old and I was diagnosed with hypertension about 7 months ago over the summer. My doctor started me off with 50 mg Metoprolol. That wasn’t helping so she increased my dosage to 100 mg with a diuretic to take along with it. I had been taking the 100mg with the diuretic for the last 5 months. They were helping my pressure but I was gaining weight, even with the decent eating and excerising no less than 4x a week. The Friday before New Year’s, I made an appointment with a new doctor (reccommended by family bc I had a feeling my current wouldn’t hear me out about the beta-blockers side effects). The doctor ended up putting me on a new medication because as I had suspected, I gained over 10lbs (I was scared to get on the scale at home). The new meds is an ACE inhibitor. My doctor told me to stop the beta blockers and start with the ACE inhibitors, a low dose of course. But now I am afraid. Should I have weened myself off the beta blockers first or at least asked him about it? Or have I not been on them long enough to? I don’t go back until the end of the month. I had been having the usual side effects with starting the ACE inhibitor. Headaches, but nothing I couldn’t handle. Yesterday (Saturday) would make a week of me taking the ACE inhibitor, and today when I got in bed to take a nap, my chest started feeling tight. Not to a point where I couldn’t function, but enough to notice. And I immediately thought about the potential danger of stopping beta blockers abruptly. Should I be worried? Should I call a doctor? Also, I started back taking my iron supplements because I’m anemic. I also heard that ACE inhibitor can cause iron deficiency. The tightness started right after I took the iron pill. I took my pressure meds earlier this morning. I’m rambling, but I’m a hypochondriac and I am getting worried. Making the tightness worse. What do you guys think? Anything would be helpful. Thanks. "
"Hypertension","Sudden increase in BP","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/sudden-increase-in-bp-627570"," Hi there,I'm currently 39 years old, male, and I've been struggling with blood pressure over the last several months. I've had bouts of pre-hypertension prior to this (depending on how you define it of course) but back in August I was having my blood pressure checked and it was quite high (150 - 160 / 100 - 110).I was already exercising and dieting at the time which I found to be frustrating. In previous times when my blood pressure was on the rise losing 5-10lbs and starting to exercise regularly would get me back where I needed to be.I modified my diet and went mostly plant based (the exception being salmon, cod) and continued to exercise and monitor my BP. Without any medication I was getting regular results of 135-145 / 85-95. I was pretty obsessive about checking it for a while there but more recently I've checked it a few times a week.On Monday of this week I checked it on my home machine and it was consistent with what I got at the gym (the gym I go to is connected with a medical facility). My BP was 140-145 / 90-95 (both at the gym and on my machine at home).I decided to check last night (Wednesday) and was shocked that I was reading 155 - 160 / 105 -110. This was pretty consistent (I took several readings over the course of 2-3 hours). I woke up this morning to the same results. I've been taking readings throughout the day and I range from 155-180 / 105 - 115. I went to the gym this morning to confirm (hoping my BP machine was being inaccurate) with the same results.I can't figure out what in the world happened? A few noob questions:1. Is it possible that excessively taking my readings (the pressure the machine puts on my arm) did a little damage somehow and made the results less accurate (wishful thinking of course - just hoping)2. The last day I had my typical readings I did some heavy resistance training. Afterward, I did about 30 minutes of HIIT. I alternated walking 2 minutes with 45 seconds of sprinting. I was wearing a HR monitor at the time and my heart rate was sore to 170-180 but only for a small interval. I don't normally do this (first time in a loooooong time for running) and just wondered if this could be a cause for concern?3. Clearly, I'm an anxious person and this is really feeding my anxiety. I'm sure this contributes, but how much?Also - While I've lost weight (35lbs or so) I'm still carrying quite a bit of excess (I'm 5'9"" and weigh 240lbs). I've fluctuated quite a bit but until this year NEVER had to worry about BP as long as I was losing weight and exercising. I made an appointment with my GP who will no doubt want me on meds which I desperately wanted to avoid...I appreciate any feedback in advance."

The 25mg is not enough to bring my heart rate down and the 50 mg lowers my blood pressure to almost dangerous levels. I start getting dizzy and almost passed out a couple of times.I was feeling very dizzy while laying down and so I took my BP. 118/43. And then I found this thing called pulse pressure.I subtracted the two numbers and got a PP of 75! According to some studies, it should actually be 40. Oh my god.But all the studies seem to only concern older people and men, so I'm not even sure if this applies? Nonetheless, I'm freaked out!I stood up and took it again. Can't remember my BP, but my PP was around 55. Better.But am I going to be okay? I've talked to a cardiologist about how low my BP goes, but she didn't seem so worried. I even told her it made me feel dizzy and she just said to take some salt water. Which is annoying to do after a while. Like, every night it's like this. It has even erupted my sleep. And well I guess she must not be worried about pulse pressure. If she even calculates that at all.Sorry... I'm going on a vent here, but this is truly frustrating. I've been dealing with this for months now and I have no idea how both my BP and HR got so high. It all just came out of nowhere, and so far my blood tests are normal.Had EKG, Stress Test, and Echo as well. All normal. Aside from mild MVP which my cardiologist isn't even concerned about it.I'm trying to push to see and endocrinologist, but either my primary doctor doesn't care or my insurance is very limiting. I have to have a ""reason"" to see an endocrinologist. I have to have a blood test first. Maybe that's a thing, but... I mean... isn't my history is high BP and high HR enough of a reason to see a specialist?I really do believe I have a thyroid problem or something and I know blood tests can be normal even if you have thyroid problems.It's all frustrating, slow, and depressing. I can barely move around without feeling dizzy and I just want to give up.I also have shortness of breath too but only god knows why. I've been to the ER more times than anyone.

What's strange is that I all of a sudden seem to be developing the dizziness and faint-feelings that the GP warned me might happen when I first started it. I didn't have this to begin with, so why might it be happening now?Just to complicate matters, I have also very recently been diagnosed with sarcoidosis, and my respiratory consultant advised a low-salt diet to help get my bp down and my kidneys as healthy as possible in case I end up needing steroids for the sarcoid. I've been following this advice, but in the course of trying to find out what is happening regarding these symptoms, I've discovered that the advice on ramipril is to ""discuss with your doctor"" if you follow a low salt diet. My consultant knows I am on ramipril and still advised this, but I suppose I'm wondering if it's possible that the low-salt diet is working, and therefore my dose of ramipril is now too high? I'm pretty new to the idea of having health conditions of any kind, so having been diagnosed with three (also have ovarian cysts) in the space of a few months has left my brain boggling!Thanks in advance for any advice or experiences.

Currently taking Metoprolol 100mg. Doing great. Almost too great. But my bottom number would shoot back up to almost 110 during activity, like walking really fast or being constipated. Yes, I monitored my BP during that time because I would get a headache/dizzy.While constipated, my BP went as high as was 130s/108. Maybe the 130 isn't so bad, but I know the 108 is. Afterwards, my BP went right back down.I'm so scared. I know this puts me at a huge risk for something deadly. Does anybody know what to do with a bottom number so high? I wonder if an actual BP med would be more helpful? But I'm also on Metoprolol because my heart rate suddenly increase as well. Not dangerously, and my heart rate is normal.It would just beat really fast.I'm seeing my doctor on the 9th. But has anybody dealt with just the bottom number spiking like this? It freaks me out, though I try to stay calm. I don't know why only the bottom number is like this. It used to be both, but now with the medication, only one spikes up badly. Maybe it means something?I had an ultrasound of my kidneys and some blood work done. So hopefully, the doctor finds something. My BP used to be normal and then it screwed up, I think due to stress, lack of sleep, etc. I hope there's a reason for all this."

He said that my pulse rate was high and that I should see a physician before getting cleared medically. I went to my physician she took my pulse and it was high again. I left the office (both the aviation medical examiner and physician) and my pulse rate shot down back to in the 70s. I tend to have a lot of anxiety going to the doctor. My question is, is this alright to have a high pulse rate at the doctor than have it come down at home? Some mentioned white coat syndrome but I was not sure about what it really was. I have had no heart palpitations at all I always feel fine and healthy never no pressure in my chest or nothing. Another thing is, without going to a doctor because my pulse rate will always be high. How can I prove that I am in good shape so I can get approved medically? Thanks for the help! "

It seems to be just a short-term effect, but I've seen it a number of times now.?Now, it is also possible that a milk-based product somehow neutralizes one of the BP meds, so it doesn't cause BP as such, but it blocks the med. This is certainly known to happen with some other drugs and nutrients. But as far as I've noticed, either fresh milk or ice cream, does not seem to have the same effect.?Thanks."

"Hypertension","Taking BP meds at night","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/taking-bp-meds-at-night-362106","From a Daily Mail artice, although it has been discussed here previously:Meanwhile scientists are testing whether taking blood pressure pills in the evening rather than the morning may be more effective at reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks. Patients traditionally take their tablets in the morning when blood pressure tends to be highest. But some studies have suggested swapping to night is a better way to reduce blood pressure and associated risks. Blood pressure drops naturally as we sleep and the theory is that taking the medication at night increases this effect. Now more than 10,000 people across the UK are taking part in a trial run by Dundee University which could lead to changes in the times hypertension drugs are taken. "

"Hypertension","Are BP readings reliable?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/are-bp-readings-reliable--612817","I think it's great having a BP measuring machine at home, they come in a bunch of models, and I guess you could even go bulb and stethoscope ""sphygmomanometer"" if you're stuck in 1967. But no reading method is very exact, and I wonder at the very concept of pressure-constricting an arm or wrist, to measure pressure.?Different doctors use different devices, and my cousin the nurse says that if a nurse gets one reading and the doctor another, believe the nurse - they do it more often. But isn't this just a little bit horrible, that we're not sure what to even make of these readings??And I'm asking really even when the readings are repeatable. I know we're not supposed to be able to just sense our BP but I can usually guess the range - usually but not often, sometimes I get surprisingly high or low readings.

Not sure I find that acceptable, my BP always goes through the roof when taken in the surgery and if it's taken by a nurse or HCA who doesn't know me she is likely to throw up all sorts of red flags. The dr knows this happens and I always take my home readings in with me. She is totally satisfied with them and doesn't even bother to strap the cuff on as she knows what the result will be.I just wondered what others here think of this.

I've been to the ER so many times, the doctors don't even hook me up to a monitor anymore or perform en EKG or draw my blood. But I had a CT scan done a couple days ago. All clear. Currently waiting for an MRI appointment.I'm very worried about my future. I know at this rate, damage to the arteries has taken place. Especially with that bottom number. With this constant headache I'm afraid of a TIA or worse. Moving around the house seems to trigger the symptoms as well. Walking around is ok, but once, I had chest pain that last for hours.

At the time, my doctor said my BP was high at around 170/90 which was similar to the pharmacy readings and put me on 20mg of Olmersartan per day. Anyway, I decided to make some lifestyle changes and have lost 10kg since May (I am well over weight) and I continue with my change in eating habits to hopefully get down more weight. Anyway, after a recent visit to the doctor for pulsatile tinnitus (which is scary but turned out to be hardened wax which needed unblocked), my doctor checked my BP and said it was still high at 166/90 and then said I needed to double my Olmersartan dose to 40mg a day to get it under control. However, I explained to him that I read my BP at home regularly and most of the time it is around 125/80 altho it has gone up to 150/90 the odd time but he said it should still not go up to 166/90.So after some research I am now finding out that my arthritis medication has a side affect of high BP and also Ibuprofen. The same doctor prescribed arthritis medication (diclofenac) which seems strange when he was also given me Olmersartan to reduce BP. My doctor also kept saying Olmersartan 40mg per day is a small dose which I am not sure is true?So, to my question, have any of you guys used natural remedies to get BP down? For the last 4 days I have stopped taken diclofenac and Ibuprofen (I was taken them alternatively) and I had already started taken magnesium citrate about a week ago which I read helps lower BP. Now I have started to use more ginger, garlic and cayenne pepper in my cooking which are all suppose to help. I have also read so much about Turmeric (and Curcumin) and how strong it is as a anti-inflammatory so will be starting to use that in cooking. I started taken a curcumin supplement (anti-inflammatory) as well to replace diclofenac/Ibuprofen with it and see how it works out.My BP is now 109/66 so not sure which is kicking in first, maybe the higher dose of Olmersartan but wondering if some of the other changes. Anyway, I am now worried with so many changes will my BP drop too low? My BP readings are starting to average around 110/70 but I am frightened it will drop too low as I only made changes around 5 days ago so sure some of the changes I have made have not kicked in yet.

"Hypertension","Newly diagnosed with high blood pressure and scared..","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/newly-diagnosed-with-high-blood-pressure-and-scared--602117","Hey there everybody. I just joined and can use some advice. I know this isn't medical advice, but I can just use some advice in general.So for the past month or so, I just haven't been feeling right. Been dizzy and whatnot. My boyfriend actually thought maybe I should be tested for diabetes because I eat A LOT of sugar. Even he's noticed, and he's told me in all honesty that I need to cut the sugar... I know this isn't good, but I have never been tested for diabests, cholesteral or anything like that. I haven't even had a physical in a good 3 years . After he told me he had some concerns about my sugar, I called my doctors office and made an appt. for a physical but they said they were booking into December and would call me a month or so before hand to make the actual appointment. Well anyway, one day while I was at his house, we were all talking with my boyfriends mom and she has some health issues, one of them being diabetes, so she has a sugar checker. So I asked if she would be able to check my sugar, and she did, and it came up 93, which she said is a good blood sugar. I was fine with everything after that but I was still so dizzy.. And I got to thinking about my blood pressure. The last time I was at my doctor's office for a sinus infection, my blood sugar was on the higher side but nothing too bad. The nurse that knows me fairly well told me that it was higher than normal for me, but still was in the ""okay range"". She said it could be due to my body fighting off an infection and she didn't think much of it.. I took it one other time at my gym, and it came up kinda high (don't remember the exact numbers) but I know those things have to be calibrated and I was excersisiing so I shrugged it off again (which now I know I probably shouldn't have). So anyway, my boyfriends mom did have a blood pressure cuff and brought it out and took my blood pressure and the first reading came up 158/118. Needless to say I was freaked out.. So she took it in the other arm, and it came up 156/105. Still freaking out at this time. So she tells me to relax a bit and takes everybody elses blood pressure....which all come out fine. Afterwards she checks mine again and it comes up 167/115. By this point, I'm freaking out but trying to stay as calm as I can...So after a few more tries, they all come up around those numbers and I take myself to urgent care. I know they can't really do anything, but I needed them to check to make sure #1 it was accurate and advise me what I should do next. When I got there and got into the room, the nurse checked my blood pressure and the first reading came up at 177/122. She told me there's no doubt my blood pressure is high but she will check it again in a few minutes, and she did and it came up 174/108, so she confirmed that my blood pressure was high but that the doctor will be in soon.So anyway, the doctor took a look at me, told me that I needed to make an appointment with my doctor within 2 weeks. When I went to urgent care it was around 7pm and my doctors office was closed so I called first thing the next morning. The receptionist told me that she had to get the reports from urgent care and give them to my doctor to look over and that they'll call me back soon to tell me what the plan was going to be. So she did and told me that he said the last time I was seen, my blood pressure was normal (which was 3 months ago or so), so it hasn't been high for too awful long, and that I needed to be seen within 1-3 weeks. Well the earliest appointment they had was 3 weeks away.. And to be honest, I'm not medical professional, but numbers that high, I feel like I should be seen sooner... I'm REALLY worried with those numbers but I'm trying not to worry too much. I bought a blood pressure cuff for myself and have taken it at least once a day and they are all coming up with 160's over 110's or in that range of some sort. I think the lowest I got was 138/105.To be completely honest, I don't eat right, I don't excersise, I've put on a good amount of weight in the last few years, and my job is very stressful. My job changed around the time my blood pressure has (maybe) started to go up to where I had to be up for work around 3am to get there by 4am. I'm 35 years old, and the mom of 2 boys, so the earliest I was getting to bed was 10pm (sometimes later), so I was usually going off only a few hours of sleep every night.So anyway, I'm hoping somebody can give me some advice about what to do . Idk if I should push to get in sooner? or wait the 3 weeks?. Idk, I'm just really scared . Any advice would be GREATLY appreciated."

It lasts around 30-60 seconds usually then I'm fine until I sit down and stand up again. It's not every time, around half the time I would say. Occasionally I also feel like I'm a bit out of breath after it happens.I have suffered from anaemia in the past and thought it might be this again so a few days ago I had a blood test (awaiting the results). But I have also been told on a few occasions to have my blood pressure checked because it was high.I recently bought a home blood pressure monitor so I could track my blood pressure and let my doctor know the results if needed. I suffer from anxiety which means I don't think my readings at the doctors at very accurate because I'm anxious. I also occasionally take propranolol for anxiety which would reduce my reading. I had it taken on Tuesday and she said it was fine (I had taken propranolol before the appt).The last time I took propranolol was on Tuesday (today is Thursday) so I assume it will have left my system so I can only assume my blood pressure readings from today are accurate (correct me if I'm wrong).Lying down reading112/69Pulse 42Standing reading98/79Pulse 78Lying down reading115/70Pulse 46At a recent doctor appt (duty dr) to discuss my symptoms the doctor mentioned postural hypotension and said to see my gp about my blood pressure it was 145/93 (no propranolol was taken) she advised me to stand up slowly (I often sit with both my legs up on the sofa).I wondered do these readings suggest postural hypotension? or perhaps something else? I can't understand why my blood pressure is so high (probably anxiety related) then quite low, especially upon standing. I'm also a little shocked at my pulse because I'm not fit in the slightest.If the blood results don't show anything I will be following up at the doctors regarding my blood pressure. I just think due to my anxiety it's going to be difficult to get calm readings as I do at home.Any advice or suggestions of things to mention to the dr would be much appreciated."

"Hypertension","Health concerns (Pre-hypertension @ age 22!)","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/health-concerns-pre-hypertension-age-22--598313","Hello, I have recently discovered that my blood pressure has been higher than it should be. I moved in late 2016, and I can admit my stress levels have been quite high since then (but my whole life has probably been like a 7/10 stress lol).A little background: I smoked Marijuana regularly when this all started. And I moved from a relatively cool weathered place to a desert. My health concerns first started with a dull but consistant chest pain. At first I thought it was something serious because I had been smoking for 2 years straight and I never had had it before, and I've NEVER had any health problems before. So I went to the ER, and they tested my blood and gave me an EKG. They said everything was fine. So I kept going on with my normal routine. I worked out A LOT, and smoked A LOT. I've began to notice the chest pains getting worse, and also happened much more frequently around the time I smoked. So after 3 or 4 months of persistance, I decided to quit smoking AND lowered my work out regimen from about 6 days a week to 3. (Because I also had a theory I was overtraining my chest muscles.) After a month or so, my pains lessened, however they remained persistant. I noticed fatigue, and my gains at the gym to stall if not cut my workout much shorter. I then stopped working out completely (and smoking weed completely), but my exercise did not cease, because I walk just about everywhere. So I would say I walk at least 2 miles a day. During this whole time I checked my blood pressure 2 or 3 times (not including the ER visit) and everything remained in the green. Recently, I've started having pains in my lower back/lower abdomen. So I rush to the conlcusion I had kidney problems. I went to the DR and I pointed to the spot it hurt, and he said It was much lower than where my kidneys were, but he ordered I get blood work to make sure. I haven't had my follow up appt yet, but it is this wednesday. Since my first appt 2 weeks ago he saw that my BP was pretty high. (167/xx), but I had a lot of alcohol the night (morning) before. So he suggested I check it daily. The following readings are my BP for the past week or so; 144/92, 150/71,147/74, 136/62, 134/70, 143/77, 130/69, 127/71, 124/63, 133/70, 127/74,135/75, 117/73 (this day was the day of my bloodwork and I had been fasting for 8 hours), 132/58, 127/68, 131/67. My reading lowered substantially after I stopped drinking alcohol completely, and stopped smoking ciggarettes. However, they remained in the pre-hypertensive state. I lowered my sodium intake, and got more sleep as well. I have also started a low weight work out regimen, and increase my water consumtion. The weather had been around 100-120 degrees where I live for some time now so I think that may have something to do with it. Anyway, I would appreciate anyones advice.Hello, I have recently discovered that my blood pressure has been higher than it should be. I moved in late 2016, and I can admit my stress levels have been quite high since then (but my whole life has probably been like a 7/10 stress lol).A little background: I smoked Marijuana regularly when this all started. And I moved from a relatively cool weathered place to a desert. My health concerns first started with a dull but consistant chest pain. At first I thought it was something serious because I had been smoking for 2 years straight and I never had had it before, and I've NEVER had any health problems before. So I went to the ER, and they tested my blood and gave me an EKG. They said everything was fine. So I kept going on with my normal routine. I worked out A LOT, and smoked A LOT. I've began to notice the chest pains getting worse, and also happened much more frequently around the time I smoked. So after 3 or 4 months of persistance, I decided to quit smoking AND lowered my work out regimen from about 6 days a week to 3. (Because I also had a theory I was overtraining my chest muscles.) After a month or so, my pains lessened, however they remained persistant. I noticed fatigue, and my gains at the gym to stall if not cut my workout much shorter. I then stopped working out completely (and smoking weed completely), but my exercise did not cease, because I walk just about everywhere. So I would say I walk at least 2 miles a day. During this whole time I checked my blood pressure 2 or 3 times (not including the ER visit) and everything remained in the green. Recently, I've started having pains in my lower back/lower abdomen. So I rush to the conlcusion I had kidney problems. I went to the DR and I pointed to the spot it hurt, and he said It was much lower than where my kidneys were, but he ordered I get blood work to make sure.

"Hypertension","Isolated systolic hypertension: Should I take Amlodipine?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/isolated-systolic-hypertension-should-i-take-amlodipine--524891","Hi all I am a male in my seventies and for the last 8 years I have had isolated systolic hypertension (ISH). During this time, I haven't been on any medication for the problem and the BP readings have been fairly similar for most of this time, averaging 170 / 70. However, at a recent visit to my doctor, he took several BP readings which fluctuated quite widely, between 148 and 220 systolic and a low diastolic between 60 and 70. I have seen in some articles that, with ISH, older adults do worse when the diastolic reading falls below 70mm because 70mm is already low enough.So the question is, should I take medication for my ISH or not as the latest reading using my own BP machine was 180/66 with a pulse of 58? In other words, because I already have a low diastolic reading, would it be dangerous to go on to medication to reduce my high systolic reading? And if you do recommend that I need to go on to medication, is Amlodipine a suitable choice? Overall, I am in very good health, and walk about 4 kilometres a day, and I don't feel any ill effects when walking up hills. Thanks very much for your help with this. Regards Martin "

He has tried Lisinopril and now is on 40 mg of lisinopril and now they added 10 mg of norvasc. He is now in his early 20's and we are still trying to figure this out. I feel like there could be something causing this. His BP with 40 mg of Lisinopril is 152/93. Any advice whould be great. Has anyone heard of such a high BP in such a young healthy active kid and if so what did you or they do? "

As soon as that cold started I felt the pressure and feeling of fullness in my neck and head, similar to what I feel when my BP goes above normal range.

This has been going up and down like a yoyo between the upper range and almost normal for the past 2.5 weeks. I've had no incidents like this at all in the past 3 years so I was surprised.

"Hypertension","Resistant Hypertension","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/resistant-hypertension-564186","Since being diagnosed with very high blood pressure (bp) in 1999, I've had a difficult time finding a bp medication that doesn't give me intolerable side effects and/or lowers the bp to an acceptable level. I have been on all the different classes of bp meds and have been on Carvedilol, a beta blocker (25 twice daily) since 2011. However, in the last few months my upper bp number has been in the high 150's to low 160's. Although on the highest recommended dose, my doctor had me try 25 three times daily which resulted in intolerable side effects. Then tried 2 1/2 daily (although the pill should not be split) but it still didn't lower bp enough. Also, since being on Carvedilol I've noticed considerable hair thinning, low platelet count, double vision in one eye, worse tinnitus, joint pain, and crusty scalp. My doctor didn't think these symptoms are from Carvedilol and was attributing them to aging (I'm in my 60's). I told her I thought it awfully coincidental that all these symptoms have developed while being on Carvedilol and want to get off a beta blocker. I've also become a blood ""clumper"" in the last two years but the hematologist doesn't think it's from the beta blocker (?).

My doctor is practically at a loss for what else to do and may refer me to a cardiologist. ALL that being said, is anyone else having a difficult time finding a bp medication that lowers it enough without intolerable side effects?Since being diagnosed with very high blood pressure (bp) in 1999, I've had a difficult time finding a bp medication that doesn't give me intolerable side effects and/or lowers the bp to an acceptable level. I have been on all the different classes of bp meds and have been on Carvedilol, a beta blocker (25 twice daily) since 2011. However, in the last few months my upper bp number has been in the high 150's to low 160's. Although on the highest recommended dose, my doctor had me try 25 three times daily which resulted in intolerable side effects. Then tried 2 1/2 daily (although the pill should not be split) but it still didn't lower bp enough. Also, since being on Carvedilol I've noticed considerable hair thinning, low platelet count, double vision in one eye, worse tinnitus, joint pain, and crusty scalp. My doctor didn't think these symptoms are from Carvedilol and was attributing them to aging (I'm in my 60's). I told her I thought it awfully coincidental that all these symptoms have developed while being on Carvedilol and want to get off a beta blocker. I've also become a blood ""clumper"" in the last two years but the hematologist doesn't think it's from the beta blocker (?).

"Hypertension","High Blood Pressure?!","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/high-blood-pressure--563467","I am a 29 year old male. Slightly overweight.Several months ago, from nowhere I felt a sudden and quick sharp pain run up my leg. I thought nothing of it and went to bed. The next morning I felt dizzy and my balance was very poor. My arms and legs also felt very heavy.I went to the hospital and they performed an MRI Scan on my brain. Everything came back clear. I was given some medication to help with the dizziness and my balance. My blood pressure was checked and it was very high. (175/100)By now the dizziness, poor balance and heavy feeling in my limbs had gone. But the blood pressure remained high. I now had a general malaise in my chest area, a feeling of heartburn/constant indigestion and the occassional moment where it felt like I had 'lost my breath'.I had further tests...An ultrasound on my leg. Everything came back clear.Lung function test. Everything came back clear.Blood test. Everything came back clear.Chest X-ray. Everything came back clear.The blood pressure continued to remain high so I was diagnosed with Stage 1 Hypertension. I had done a 24 hour Blood Pressure check and my average daytime figure was somewhere around 145/95. I was told this was high 'but not that high' so I was prescribed some medication. (Diovan)My father does have high blood pressure, but the onset of my symptoms seemed so sudden. I am relatively active (I walk a lot) and my diet isn't what I would say terrible. (I don't smoke and I rarely drink)I have been taking the diovan for several weeks and there has been little improvement. Some days I am completely symptom-free, but my blood pressure is still high. Other days, I have all of the symptoms.It's worth pointing out I am currently living abroad. I haven't got on particularly well with the healthcare in this unnamed country. (e.g- being prescribed medication without any discussion of my diet/lifestyle) I will see a doctor when I return home next month, but I feel like there is more to this than me just simply having high blood pressure.Any input would be greatly appreciated."

I have always known that I have had high blood pressure since I was 18, but no doctor ever told me i needed to do anything about it, until the other day. The doctor brought in several other doctors to lecture me about my blood pressure levels and said I need to be on medication. They said it may not affect me now, but can at any day. They said any one of my major artieries could start to shut down. They informed that I had 180/113 and that was the highest levels they've seen in sometime. They claimed it doesnt matter how perfect my diet is or how much I exercise, it won't change my bp since its hereditary. Is there any other options to lower my BP other than taking meds? I am someone that does not like to put anything like that in my body. I only resort to meds at an absolute last restort. I feel no different then i've always felt. I only went to the doctor due to having walking pneomonia, which is the first time i've been to the doctor in years. That's when they informed me of my ""deadly"" hypertension.

"Hypertension","Lotensin (benazepril) effectiveness and libido","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/lotensin-benazepril-effectiveness-and-libido-258846","I'm sorry for the double question - ""hitting two birds with one stone"" type of thing - but it's about the same drug.I have been taking benazepril for two years now, and I have noticed that it seems less and less responsive and effective. Its onset is supposed to be about an hour, but after an hour I now notice very little change in my high morning BP readings, which average 160/95, hr 64. (My heart rate is never a problem since I quit amlodipine, the poison from hell - use the search window to read my other postings on amlodipine for all the gory details.) I take 40mg of benazepril in a single dose in the morning on an empty stomach.The situation is complicated because I also have generalized anxiety disorder and whenever I take 1 mg of alprazolam later in the morning, my blood pressure drops in an hour, often ~50 points in my systolic and ~25 in my diastolic!This drop seems much more than just alprazolam had ever done on its own, and it seems that perhaps (just a guess now!!) that alprazolam (xanax) somehow potentiates (increases the activity) of the benazepril. But alprazolam leaves me drowsy and unmotivated - formerly I only took it at night before bedtime, but now it is the only thing that keeps my BP under control during the day, but it's making working and functioning during the day very difficult - I feel like I constantly need a nap badly, even though I slept well throught the night.I also discovered when I consumed large amounts of potassium-rich food and took potassium supplements (a no-no with ACE inhibitors such as benazepril), that my BP stayed down, and my energy stayed up.The second problem is that lately I have had no libido, no sexual interest whatsoever - and I have always had a very high sex drive. This is simply a fact - a sometimes quite inconvenient one, not a brag in the least. I have also ceased having morning non-sexual erections, which have been normal all my life. I've taken alprazolam for years longer than benazepril and have never had this phenomenon with alprazolam. Benazepril is the newest drug I've taken regularly (aside from my 2 weeks with amlodipine, which actually cause the opposite problem of inappropriate, unwanted, even painful priapism several times during the night!!)I am at such a loss now. My doctor says he has no more to offer, but I cannot continue to run 160+/90+ with benazepril, and do not want to continue to compensate this apparently weakening, sexual-neutralizing ACE inhibitor to lower my BP with benzos, i.e., alprazolam, which I must take to control my anxiety/panic attacks.I cannot take amlodipine - whose ONLY positive aspect is that it dramatically lowers your blood pressure to normal - at a great cost in unpleasant, sometimes scary side effects.I hope this helps someone in a similar plight, and I hope that we can find some helpful suggestions. My immediate plan is to drop benazepril and increase my intake of potassium, both by food and supplements. "

As with any therapy, you should work with your health care provider before starting any treatment. You may use herbs as dried extracts (capsules, powders, teas), glycerites (glycerine extracts), or tinctures (alcohol extracts). Unless otherwise indicated, you should make teas with 1 tsp. herb per cup of hot water. Steep covered 5 - 10 minutes for leaf or flowers, and 10 - 20 minutes for roots. Drink 2 - 4 cups per day. You may use tinctures alone or in combination as noted.Talk to your doctor before taking any herbs to treat hypertension, especially if you already take medication to control blood pressure.Achillea wilhelmsii, in a tincture, may help lower blood pressure, according to one double-blind study. However, more research is needed. Achillea may interact with blood thinners such as warfarin (Coumadin), clopidogrel (Plavix), and aspirin. It may also interact with lithium and some sedatives.Hibiscus (Hibiscus sabdariffa) tea helped lower blood pressure according to one study. Pregnant women should not take hibiscus.Reishi mushroom (Ganoderma lucidum) may help lower blood pressure, although evidence is weak. You may also take a tincture of this mushroom extract. Reishi can interact with other medications and may increase the risk of bleeding.Garlic (Allium sativum) may help lower blood pressure slightly, although not all studies agree. Garlic may interact with blood thinners such as warfarin (Coumadin), clopidogrel (Plavix), and aspirin. It can also interact with many other medications.HomeopathyFew studies have examined the effectiveness of specific homeopathic remedies. A professional homeopath, however, may recommend one or more of the following treatments for hypertension based on their knowledge and clinical experience. Before prescribing a remedy, homeopaths take into account a person’s constitutional type -- your physical, emotional, and intellectual makeup. An experienced homeopath assesses all of these factors when determining the most appropriate remedy for a particular person.Argentum nitricum -- for people whose blood pressure increases as they feel anxious or nervous. They may be warm-blooded and subject to claustrophobia and strong carvings for sweets and salty food.Aurum metallicum -- for people who are serious in demeanor and who concentrate on their career. There is a general tendency to feel worse at the end of the day. They may have a strong desire for alcohol, and feel angry or depressed when they believe they have failed.Calcarea carbonica -- for people who often feel tired and overwhelmed when sick. They may have clammy hands and feet and often feel chilly. They may crave sweets and eggs, and may be overweight.Lachesis -- for people who are often talkative and agitated, with a fear of disease. They may be suspicious and jealous, and feel tightness in the chest. They feel worse after sleeping, and may not be able to tolerate clothing around their necks.Nux vomica -- for people who are impatient, don't like to be delayed, and are ambitious and driven. They may have a strong desire for coffee and other stimulants, and may be sensitive to light. "

I sometimes find it even starts as I'm approaching the time to take them, so even though most days I stick to the same time, I start feeling unwell beforehand. The problem is that I am between a rock and a hard place as I get side effects from the meds, which are unpleasant, and have done with several of them over the years, yet can't lower them because my blood pressure soars. A real nightmare; this is starting to rule my life.I wondered if anyone feels anything like this, or any other feelings when their blood pressure is running high?

I am diagnosed with hypertension and my readings have been always around (150/110, 151/105).I have consulted 3 doctors and 2 of them put me on daily pills (Revalol 50XL) but the BP was still around 150/95, even after taking pills for 3 straight months. He was going to increase the dosage so I decided to take a second opinion. The 3rd doctor said my earlier blood pressure readings could be wrong (white coat syndrome may be ?) and asked me to get off the pills as our body gets habituated to the pills and you cannot stop taking it. He asked to relax, stay happy and do exercise everyday. So I am not taking medicines as of now and I been working on reducing my weight and changing my lifestyle. I have been experiencing awkward sensation in left side of the chest. It cannot be termed as pain but kind of weird feeling and it makes me feel that something is not right. That sensation is not only limited to the chest but I sometimes I get that in left shoulder, left back and in the fingers too. When I was under pills, that sensation disappeared but it is back as soon as I stopped taking pills. So there is a connection. When i get up in the morning, my heartbeats are faster than normal.Frankly, I don't want to take medicines for life and I am ready to do anything to reduce it naturally. But it seems like my body is not able to reduce the blood pressure to normal levels. I feel devastated. I never smoked nor had a drink in my life. I eat healthy food and I don't have a stress in my life.Is anyone else here experiencing a similar situation and have you had any success in lowering your BP by natural means?

In 2016, I did my routine check up and BP was 160/110, 155/106 and doc asked me to be on medication.1. I don't smoke or drink.2.

Every year I do around 160 shows during summer in various hotels on the island with my crossover group.I am 49 years old and was diagnosed with hypertension in 2012. Since then I have taken 30mg of Adalat CR (slow release) successfully. Last year in November my cardiologist added Co-Approvel 300mg (in winter) and 150mg (in summer) to the mix and told me to take the Adalat twice daily. My BP is normally then around 120/80.During the hot Corfu summer I really started to experience problems with this combo. I was continuesly tired and dizzy. Sometimes the BP would spike after shows (180/110). Other times it would drop to 110/60. So during the whole summer concert season I was micromanaging my blood pressure.When the season however recently started to change into autumn, I started to experience extreme fatigue. My blood pressure shoots up to 150/90 if I walk from the bedroom to the kitchen and falls rapidly when I sit down. My pulse, which is normally between 60 and 70 will shoot up to 80 or 90 and then comes down again when I rest.Today, because of the colder weather I have taken 300 mg of Co-Approvel and it just makes me feel dizzy and jittery. About ten days ago I also started to have a kidney infection that I need to take antibiotics for at the moment. At first my BP was (probably because of the infection) low at night. Twice 80/49. Today it was high again, hence the fact that I took the double dosage.I am totally at a loss. Right now my BP reading is 122/86.In the last two weeks I had blood tests and saw a cardiologist who did a ECG and heart sonar. All fine. He could not explain my fatigue and BP fluctuation. Maybe I am just overworked? I took off from work for ten days but I don't seem to improve. Plus I am on my second five day course of antibiotics for the kidneys that, at times, really hurt.Hope there is someone out there that can help."

She drove to the hospital and was admitted to the ICU with high blood pressure (235/176) in which she's been taking .1 mg of Chlonidine to control over the past 3 years. They coded her as having a ministroke to the brain (TIA) after she displayed temporary stoke-like symptoms (unable to lift arm, stick out her tongue, say her name). Well, they discharged her from the Hospital on Sunday with 3 new blood pressure medications. She came home and was doing ok (mostly laying down, talking, relaxing). By Tuesday, we called 911 because she became non-responsive after feeling extremely week, hot and sweating profusely. She sat down and frantically called out for help. Then, she had an episode where her face and body became stiff, her eyes stared off in a daze with tears rolling down her cheek. She could see and hear us, but could not talk or move parts of her body. Her face, mouth, limbs, shut down for 30 seconds at a time. Her blood pressure was 170/101. She even Passed out in the ambulance. The doctors in the Stroke ambulance said she was having seizures and not a stroke. She was admitted into another hospital During the next few days, the episodes (response delays and stiffness) became longer, sometimes up to 5 minutes at a time. even after being readmitted into hospital, these episodes continued throughout the day until she went to bed! The MRI, CT Scan, EEG, Echocardiogram, EKG and blood work all came back negative showing no signs of stroke or seizures. So we have no idea what's going on. The neurologist from the 2nd hospital performed a 2.5-hour EEG, but found no seizure activity. She scheduled a 24-hour EEG to be performed at a 3rd hospital, so that they can totally rule out seizure activity. She was discharged from the 2nd hospital. On Friday, my mother started having episodes again. Weakness, heaviness in chest area, she was really faint. I asked her to move her eyes to the left and to the right. She could not. I asked her to lift her arms/legs. She could not. After a about 20 seconds, she could speak, but her Speech was very short and choppy. She tried to start a sentence, but she hesitates, stutters, and pronounces words incorrectly. She said it feels like her brain freezes. Can anyone shed some light? "

It seemed to do the trick with bringing my bp down to an acceptable level, but occasionally I'd still have high readings. Eventually I was referred to a renal specialist who did loads of tests (24 hour urine collection, mri, bloods etc) and all came back as normal. I asked if I can come off my meds and he said I could trial stopping them but it takes a week to be out of my system. Before I stopped my readings were: 121/8724 hours off meds: 119/74 which I thought was great!However 36 hours off and my headaches and strained vision seems to be making a come back. As well as a few aches in my thigh and shoulder and arm. My bp reading is now up to: 154/95It's not super high, so should I wait to see if it goes back down again? I was thinking to wait until morning then if it's still high to go back on the tablets.

"Hypertension","CCBs","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/ccbs-506394","Having read a number of threads here over the last few months, there seem to be some quite knowledgeable people regarding CCBs. Although I've been taking these for just over 18 months now, I'm not really sure why I'm taking them, as opposed to a 'normal' HBP medication. Many years ago I used to take atenolol which is what I would describe as 'normal'.I will say that I am taking these along with seven othe prescription medications. It would probably help if I stated my condition, which I will do, but initially, I'd like to know what the 'generic' use of them, compared to non CCB HBP medication is."

The doctors can't work out why I have HBP as I am slim and 47 with a healthy diet, however he did ask me how much I drank, and I was fairly honest, not much in the week but can certainly drink a bottle or red on a Saturday which appauled him. There are 10 units in that, you can't save them up you know he yelled..I don't think it was that bad Anyway, I do feel this is all down to anxiety but the HBP remains and I'm not sure what to do next, I feel like a walking time bomb. Everytime my BP is taken the nurse/doctors purse their lips and up the dosage. I'm just off for hypnotherapy in a bit to give that a whirl, though the hypnotherapist herself mentioned she has HBP so not holding out much hope.Any advice/guidance would be welcomed, I'm not sure where to turn next.

I have bad anxiety with a real issue around medical stuff. Nurse recommended I get my own monitor which I did, tested for a month then brought the readings in to the doctor. Home results were mostly on the high end of normal. She took it again at her office, refusing to use the necessary large cuff, and giving a reading around 155/85. She told me I would need to go on medication for white coat hypertension...!Since then I've had tests all coming up normal (kidneys, cholesterol, ecg). They insisted on doing the ECG directly before a blood test - knowing I am extremely scared of needles. My heart rate was around 103 and the nurse & doctor told me I had ""severe tachycardia"" (what?!) even though it started to come down after a bit. They repeated the ECG 3 more times and eventually got it down to 87. I tried to tell them that my normal resting is ~65 and they basically laughed in my face. They started talking about medication for my heart rate as well as bp.I had a 24hr BP monitor 2 weeks ago which was awful. As soon as the nurse put it on, it inflated and was so painful I was nearly sick. She told me it's because my arm is big that it has to inflate more, which I understand. For the next 12 hours it was mostly just uncomfy and a bit painful. Every single reading when I was resting was around 125/75, with a few of 130s/80s while walking, cleaning etc. In the night, it woke me up every hour and adrenaline went through my body spiking my heart rate up to 80 or 90, giving ""night time"" readings of 130-140/80s! By this time every inflation was sickening,crushing agony so I gave up at 3am and took it off!I'm seeing my doctor tomorrow to discuss but I just found out she went behind my back and referred me to a cardiologist without telling me...

Within two days of coming of it it felt like a cloud had been lifted from my brain and I felt incredibly sharp. I realised for the first time that the Losartan had been causing this cloud. The changes in my brain had occurred so gradually over the four years I hadn't actually noticed.The doctor then prescribed Amlodpoine Besylate 5mg, which worked ownderfully and my blood pressure plummetted. This was in combination with Atenolol. Over a few months I began to feel really drained and quite ill, until I nearly passed out in a taxi. I knew it was the Amlodopine, as I had been through a similar experience with Losartan. I stopped taking it and the cloud lifted from my brain with 48 hours.Went back to the doctor who prescribed Losartan Potassium 50mg with 12.5mg hydrochlorothiazide (as well as the Atenolo 25mg). After a few months I am finding the brain fog is returning and when I stop taking it I feel much better.Got to go back to the GP. Has anyone had a similar experience to me, and if so did you ever find a drug that actually works and doesn't make you feel tired/ill all the time?The Atenolo works really well. It brings my heart rate down to about 75. Amlodopine brought the BP down to about 125/80. The Losartan never did better than 140/90.Thanks in advance"

I will give you a brief background on myself. Since i was 28/ 29 I have been on bp tablets. I am healthy active women and weight 8 1/2 stone now 9 stone and I am 5'2 and 31 years old now. I eat well of course with the odd takeaway. I am not massively into anything with salt. (I don’t put it on food). When I started to get these extremely bad headaches I ignored them. Then it got to the stage I had to go home and sleep them off, This came frequent.. Then I notice I was getting very Breathless walking around and short of breath and along with this I was always very lifeless. I went into the chemist one day and they checked my reading it was 155/95 they said for me to go to the doctor. I did and ever since I am on blood pressure tablets. I started off on 20mg of Marcardis. when I was 28.And last month I am on 40g Marcardis. The reason for this was the headaches came back, I got very foggy head and I was feeling extremely tired all the time and a pain in my left side of my chest. Readings on the BP monitor was 144/105 pulse 82 and 148/100.I am getting readings of today 116/82 pulse 89 and readings later of 128/78 it is very up and down. I have still have the occasional 189/90 reading.The reason for why I decided to join was I do not feel ok. The doctor goes oh it is hte bp it will be ok. But I have a lot of pressure in my head, If I bend down to look under the bed it feels like my head is going to explode. And now my right eyeball is gone completely red with the veins. Would this be related to my blood pressure? I still workout and do a lot of yoga and trying to keep active. But the lack of energy and I am loosing my balance a lot even walking if frustrating. I am dizzy even when my bp is up high. Is there anything I should be watching out for ? or asking? Hopefully someone will be able to help me out. Thanks to whoever reads this. "
"Hypertension","Is there an optimum time to take home readings of BP?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/is-there-an-optimum-time-to-take-home-readings-of-bp--505096","When diagnosed 3 years ago [163/90], my GP said to take 2 home readings twice a day at random times and to record just the lower of the 2 readings. Taking it twice or even 3 times I could get a variation of up to 20 sys. between the first and the last reading. The second readings I would take in the evening and those were invariably lower. If I take the early readings after breakfast instead of before I mostly get really low readings, around the 110 syst. level [why?]. I want to keep these numbers as low as I can but which of the two times gives the most accurate figure? After some months the rules changed and i was instructed to take the 2 readings as before but to do an average of them and this is what I do still.Before I have my 6 month check up I have to do the same readings and record every one for 8 days pror to the check up then do an average of them all to show to her. Based on these figures she will presumably assess if the dosage of Losartan 50mg is the right dose.I just can't help worrying that I get wildly variable readings, do other people get these fluctuating readings?It would appear that as long as the average overall is fine then there is nothing to worry about, is this right?

"Hypertension","High blood pressure - 23/M","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/high-blood-pressure-23-m-505179","Hi everyone, Apologies for the long post & also thanks in advance for any assistance given. I am a 23 year old male with high blood pressure and a bit confused about what I can do to lower it. I first learned of my high blood pressure when I was 21 and woke up with very bad chest pains. I dismissed it at first as I had been having similar pains for the previous few years. After about 8 hours I decided to go to the hospital and told them about it. They did ECGs etc. and said there was nothing wrong with me and I should go home. They had noticed that my ECG was abnormal (but were not sure if 'it was normal for me')and that my BP was elevated. After going back to a private doctor he put me through blood tests / MRI / CT scans / ECGs as well as a 24 hour blood pressure monitor. They also did another test which I can't remember the name of but was a bit like an ultrasound on a pregnant woman. When the results came back he suspected I had a case of pericarditis and was surprised when my blood pressure average came back as 155/90 over 24 hours. I am not overweight, I exercise a few times a week, do not smoke and although I drink more now I didn't drink too much at the time. Admittedly my diet was very bad a couple of years ago and I decided to change it to prevent any further damage.Being quite stubborn I ignored the doctor's advice to go for thyroid test / adrenal gland tests etc. and hoped it would improve with just a change in diet. Coming into 2016 (now 23 and still on a fairly good diet/lifestyle and low salt intake) I used a friend's blood pressure monitor and got quite a few averages - from different times of the day during the period of a week - and got readings typically around 170-180/100. I decided to go back to a doctor last month and gave him the list to have a look at. He sent me off to do a full range of blood tests and everything came back in the normal range - including thyroid tests / cholesterol etc. but my blood pressure was still high when he measured it at 160/100. He prescribed an 80mg ARB dose once per day. A month of this treatment has gone by and I am still getting readings anywhere around 150-180/85-105. While I do drink more than I should I otherwise seem quite healty and I am bit concerned that it is still not coming down. I'd really appreciate any advice / guidance on where I should go from here with my doctor? Is there, perhaps, anything they might have overlooked? Thanks again.Tom"
"Hypertension","Natural treatments for hypertension?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/natural-treatments-for-hypertension--504331","Does anyone know about non-drug treatments for hypertension, especially the isolated systolic kind (high systolic/low diastolic)? But not magnesium or ubiquinol. Has anyone here tried Anistrol?I'm not keen on taking calcium channel blockers etc., partly due to side-effects and also because they reduce both readings. I'm already getting dizzy spells so don't want to reduce my diastolic any further. History below if anyone's interested.72-year-old female, BP steady at 110/70 till menopause at 45, then started climbing. 150/90 by mid 50s. I put myself on magnesium 375mg per day, which was well tolerated (no diarrhoea). BP fell to 120/80 after a couple of months, and stayed there for the next 15 years.A year or so ago the diastolic started falling and the systolic rising. Most days I record 160/60, both on my home monitor and in my doctor's office. Still taking magnesium, I added in ubiquinol, starting at 100mg per day, increasing to 200mg after a couple of weeks. After a few months my BP was steady at 130/70, plus the extrasystoles that have plagued me all my life had stopped.Five months after starting ubiquinol the diarrhoea kicked in. Very severe, as in not being able to leave the house some days. Because it started so late it took me six weeks to work out the connection. It cleared up when I stopped the ubiquinol. BP now back to 160/60 but the extrasystoles haven't returned. Yet.General health excellent, apart from mild Sjogren's syndrome (autoimmune condition) and under-active thyroid treated with thyroxine. Recent bloodwork perfect according to my doctor. Lifelong non-smoker, moderate wine consumption, very low salt intake - small amount when cooking potatoes and vegetables only, and no junk food. BMI 23.6 and I'm reasonably active, walking one hour per day on average.Any suggestions? I'm wondering whether to try stopping the magnesium and re-starting the ubiquinol, as I suspect it might have been the joint effect of both that caused the diarrhoea. But I'm open to any other ideas."

I currently go to bootcamp 3 times a week, do a workout dvd once a week. Food wise I am on a plan with a Persona Trainer where I eat things like eggs for breakfast, chicken and veg for lunch, some carbs like sweet potato or rice in the evening but only after a workout. I don't snack, i rarely have crisps or chocolate or fast food, yet still my body doesn't want to shift the weight.So last night my blood pressure came up at 155/105 which was obviously high (so I was told as I have no clue). He tried a few more times but it only got higher, probably because I was stressing at this point, but he has told me he is concerned as it shouldn't be this high at 25 years of age. He sent me for blood tests today and said they would do lots of tests to try and resolve this, but what worries me is looking online how it can cause strokes, heart attacks, etc.Also with regards to my diets I don't know what I can cut out as I rarely ever drink alcohol, I don't eat bread, crisps, biscuits, anything like that. I mainly eat chicken, peppers, onion, courgetter, some red meat. I drink water but have 1 can of diet coke a day.

Nothing officially came of this either.December last year he had yet anouther monitor, this time to take blood pressure morning and night for 7 daysm the results were noted as 'higher than it should be' so a few blood and unine tests followed, the results of which are clear. The problem is where to go from here? The doctors seem to be happy that he is 'OK' and are leaving him to it until the next time they check his blood pressure during a routine visit and notice its high, they;ll send him home iwht the monitor aghain and the same thing shappens again.

I was taken to St. Thomas's hospital where I was thrombolysed. I made an amazing recovery having initially lost my speech, use of my right arm and right leg. Within 5 days I was allowed home. I was given Simastatin, aspirin, ramipril, persantin and omeprazole. The Simvastatin 40mg initially gave me pains in my legs, but this slowly subsided. However, my biggest worry for the past 8 months has been the control of my blood pressure. On one occasion when I had to attend our primary care clinic because my bp had risen to 269/104 I was given Indamapide, when this failed to lower my bp I was put on beta blockers, these did lower my blood pressure but also lowered my heart beat to 40, causing me to pass out, so I was taken off the beta blockers. I was also taken off ramipril because of the awful cough which developed over the months. I then went on to Candesartan 8mg. When that failed to lower my bp it was increased to 16mg and then to 32mg.On having my blood pressure checked yesterday at 4p.m. the reading was 189/104 - so we are back to square one. I have today started taking Losartan combined with hydrochlorothiazide (Cozaar - Comp) so we will see how that goes. I am also on 80mg of simvastatin a day, which is giving me headaches.

So the morning i called doctors to book in for the next day but by early noon i developed a really bad headache that wouldnt budge even after taking loads of panadol. The morning of the appointment i still had the headache and told doctors of the symptons i been having and she didnt seem to think it was anything apart from a viral bug i might have caught. Blood pressure taken was around 140ish. Got given an appointment to come down a couple of days later to take bloods to check thyroids level.No sooner then getting back in house i started vomiting but only bringing water up and this continued throughout the day with the headache getting worse and worse so i called doctors to be asked to seen again. Doctors saw me and gave me some anti sickness pill and told me to come back next day to see if headache any improvement and gets blood done then instead of waiting. So after a night sleep the headaches eased of and sickness has gone so had bloods done to check thyroids level. (This was on a Friday). Over the weekend i felt totally fine then on Monday got called back into doctors as results have come back but thyriods was clear so doctor retook blood pressure and somehow over the weekend it had shot up to 230. The doctor was soo shocked and had to phone hospital to see if they wanted to admit in hospital but the hospital said to start me on Ramipril 2.5mg and to see how i get on for the day and recheck blood pressure next day.So next day had blood pressure checked and was still high around 220 so was admitted into hospital where they took loads of bloods, given me loads of meds to bring my blood pressure down and eventually had to stay overnight. Next day had ultrasound down to check kidneys as they found protein in urine. Ultrasound came back fine. So i was sent home with amlodipine 10mg and doxazosin 2mg and told to come back next day for eye scan. Coming home to sleep was a huge relief as i hated hospitals and was feeling really tired and run down by now. Next day had to attend the eye scan and BP was around 180ish, scan was ok apart from some bleeding at back of eyes but was apparently normal as my bp had been soo high so need to recheck after a month later. Doctors then sent me on a CT scan which was fine too and then upped my dose of doxazosin to 4mg but 2mg to be taken at morning and the following 2mg at night.So after a month of being on the bp meds bp has dropped to 140ish/130ish but the side effects have been awful. Constantly getting up at night to go toilet, dry mouth, restricted breathing, nose constantly blocked, tired, weaken immune system, struggling to breath at night whilst sleeping and constantly getting up gasping for breath that i now have developed a fear of sleeping.Have seen the doctors at gp surgery about this but he has said to go back to 2mg of doxazosin and given me a spacer for the inhaler to help with breathing. Tried to make another appointment with the usual doctor in surgery i see but she is away until tomorrow. So for the past 3 days i came of all meds and i feel alot better. I have more energy, i can sleep without gasping for air etc but bp is creeping back up to 170ish/160ish.Im really scared that they gonna put me on meds again and i will be back to feeling like crap again. im only 36yrs old and i dont think i can live with feeling like that for the rest of my life.

"Hypertension","Blood Pressure suddenly rises","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/blood-pressure-suddenly-rises-479567","I have had high blood pressure for nearly 3 years. It was brought on by excessive drinking and consumption of energy drinks. When I got diagnosed with high BP my bp was 220/118. It took me nearly a year to get it under control. I have had to learn that when your bp goes up, it takes days for it to come back down. But I still have episodes where it ramps up. I am one of those lucky few that can feel it when it rises. If my top number goes above 150 my chest starts to tighten and my face feels prickly and sometimes I get headaches. My last cardiologist visit my bp check in at 128/78. My cardiologist removed me from the diuretic I was taking and cut my office visits from 2 to one a year. Well 2 months after that visit I met an amazing woman and I am head over heels for her but she lives far away and is in the process of moving in my area. We talk via text and phone but it's not the same as in person and I honestly believe I am stressing about it. For about 3 days now my chest has been squeezing. I took my bp and it was 163/83, and that was yesterday. Today I took it and it was 161/76 and tha was right after I got up. I take 40 mg of Lisinopril. I also take a bunch of supplements aimed at helping reduce blood pressure. I take fish oil, krill oil, garlic oil, L-arginine(just started that one), resveratrol, amealpeptide, and coq10. I have had stress related elevations in bp 2 other times. The last one sent me to the ER because I thought I was having a heartattack. I was fine. I guess what gets me is that it takes me days, even a week or 2 to get my blood pressure back to a normal range. Why? Why does it take so long and why do I feel my chest tighten? Everytime it happens I think I have a blockage. My sister always reminds me that I go walking 4 to 5 days a week at 40 minutes a pop. She said if I had a blockage I would not even be able to make it around the track one time. I also notice when I start walking if I had any tightness, it would go away. I guess it's worry and anxiety over the beautiful woman. She is always on my mind and I guess I need to focus on something else. Has anyone ever had this problem? I feel like I am the only one but I know there is someone else that can relate."

"Hypertension","Is it appropriate for me to go see a Cardiologist?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/is-it-appropriate-for-me-to-go-see-a-cardiologist--398693","Two and a half months ago, I found out my bp was 135/92 at a doc visit. I've never had a bp issue in my life. I freaked out, started obsessing over it and then my bp begain to see saw. Sometimes it would spike as high as 178/112, w/ a headache, then quickly come down to maybe 116/88. HBP runs in my family so I guess I've finally come down with it too at 33 yrs. old. I've been on bp meds for 2 months now. I tried splitting the pills seeing if my bp would hold on its own, as it was staying around 110/76ish. Within a week it started see sawing again . I put myself back on the full meds and now my bp can be anywhere from 97/60 - 116/83ish. Everyone thinks I'm suffering stress/anxiety about having hbp, and being on these awful meds which is causing hair loss and swollen ankles. I've been told by friends I should talk to a cardiologist about my hbp, and choices for better meds as a specialist would be better at this than a GP. Especially since in the past 2 months I quit a very potent saline laxative that I was using for the past 4 yrs., and energy drinks. I've already had an EKG done at my doc office, which came back normal. So should I really be talking to a cardiologist? I don't want to offend my regular doc. She's aware of my ankle swelling, and gave me a water pill to take in conjunction. It's just making me pee a lot on top of everything else. I just don't want to go through 50 bad experiences before I get to the right one. Should I give my doc a chance or just skip all the ""guessing"" she's going to do, and see someone who deals with this specific thing every single day?"

"Hypertension","BP 233/114","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/bp-233-114-398015","Last Saturday morning my BP had been its usual morning level 168/85. As the morning went on my chest felt tight and bloated but no wind coming up and my head felt tight as well.When I checked my BP at 5pm it was 196/95 heart rate 44. After a small for me dinner I checked it again at 8pm as my chest and head felt even tighter with a slight pain behind my breast bone and a numbness in my left arm and tingling fingers. It was 232/114, heart rate showing as irregular and 66. I took the 50mg Losartan I now take at night.I phoned the out of hours 111 service and they said to get to A&E within the hour. Ambulance? No chance but if you feel worse on the way dial 999. Eight in waiting room and screen said 2 hour wait to be seen. Saw triage nurse after about half an hour and she got reading of 220/80 and did an ECG. She compared it to an earlier one that I pointed out was from November 2011 the last time that I had gone to A&E with chest pain prior to my aortic valve replacement. They only have records for A&E visits and cannot access other records.She asked if I had been very fit when younger. I asked why and he replied because of my low heart rate. I denied ever having been fit. Then seen by a mature student nurse in her late 40's who took BP again and fitted me up to heart monitor. BP still over 200 but heart rate fluctuating from 70's dropping into my usual high 40's. Heart trace showing various irregularities. They then took bloods and sent them to lab with an hours wait to get them back.Then seen by a middle aged Asian doctor who I could hardly understand and who could not pronounce words like bicuspid or prosthetic.He said that I was in AF and said Losartan will not lower your BP you need amlodipine and gave me a tablet. I went through my reasons for not taking Warfarin, Statins and Amlodipine.Blood results eventually came back and he was concerned that troponin level (sign of having had a heart attack)was a bit high and said that they would keep me overnight to check it again and wanted me to have a chest X-Ray. Ended up in five bed MAU (medical assessment unit) ward after 1am. Another doctor came to see me. Go through history and BP now around 180/85 and he wants me to take a 100mg Losartan and says that I should be on warfarin. I tell him of joint pain with it and he suggests Rivaroxaban that I tell him is contra indicated with a replaced heart valves. He looks it up in BNF on his iPad and says that they can still prescribe it if they think it is necessary although it has not been tested on heart valve patients. I go through my usual refusal routine. He wants a urine test done in case my high BP has caused bleeding from the kidneys. I tell him that the nurse downstairs had already checked my urine. He says that she might not have checked it for that.... no notes made down in A&E? He says that his boss will see me in the morning. It is now 2.45 and my sleepy wife gets a taxi home.No chance of sleep there as ward bright for me and others in the ward getting attention most of the night and another patient brought in after one sent elsewhere. All the time it sounds from the constant chatter and laughter at the nurses station that they are having a cocktail party with other staff joining in. A couple more times they come and take my BP and then put a cannula in and take more blood for testing.The boss doctor comes in to see me around 7am. Go through all the usual stuff warfarin etc. He is also told that rivaroxaban is not for me. He notes that the blood tests show iron/ferritin level is low. I tell him that I had to have a ferritin infusion before my operation and iron tablets sometime after but since been told that level is borderline. He assumes that I am losing blood from somewhere and should have another colonoscopy... you want me back in AF I ask. Well you should have an endoscopy in case it is from your stomach. No way I tell him, I gag just cleaning my teeth and my uncle and a doctor at the practice I used to go to both like Joan Rivers went into cardiac arrest and died during one. I did actually have one in 1983 but never again. He says that they will fit me with a 24 hour ECG monitor. And off he goes. Soon a very junior pasty faced young feminist doctor comes to see me and we argue about rivaroxaban and other drugs and I tell her as the others that the three makers of the new anti-coagulants had all confirmed to me that I should not take them. Losing the argument she then turns her head away from for the rest of the time asking if I want to have a stroke. I ask if she wants me to have a bleeding brain or stomach instead and she stomps off. No one ever asked for that urine sample.All in the ward are in a pretty bad way. One is from a specialist facility for permanently disabled people. He has his own carers with him who do twelve hour shifts.They have decided to move me to a cardiology ward just as my dinner is arriving. I'm taken up there with my dinner. I ask if they can heat it up for me and am told that nurses are not allowed to use the microwave:-) Eventually they find someone from catering who is authorised and I get to eat. This ward is even worse than the last one with five old guys continually coughing their guts up with chest infections. I protest but am told that they are not infectious. One is comatose all the time the others most of the time. Two have dementia and at least two have had a stroke. None are capable of conversation. I say that after a sleepless night that I hope that this ward is dark and quiet. I'm assured that it is. When the main lights are turned off the ward is like a disco with flashing lights from various equipment. I get up and pull my curtains round my bed but green lights still flash through and the five others cough and choke. Three of them keep trying to get out of bed. A nurse decides to sit in the middle of the ward to keep an eye on them. I manage about an hours sleep before more noise wakens me up. By now I am seriously considering checking out. I get back to sleep for a little while before getting wakened to have my BP taken at 2am. Another restless hour awake and doze off to be wakened to have the battery in my ECG monitor changed as it is not transmitting. Doze off again and then nurse back as one of the leads has detached. At 6am they come round doing blood pressures etc (now 164/78).Another young doctor and his even younger learner come round and say that I can go home. I'm no longer in AF but have my usual ectopic beats that I seldom notice but show on my BP monitor and my troponin reading is within range so I have not had a minor heart attack. Stay on the same BP medication. If they had tried to change it I would have said no as the Hypertension Centre I attend are now supposed to be doing that. Have the Rivaroxaban conversation yet again with him saying that they can override the makers and the BNF if they think fit although even if it has not been tested on patients with prosthetic valves. He says that I will get an appointment to have a seven day ECG monitor fitted and an appointment in three months with a cardiologist. I tell him that my GP had asked for me to be referred back to cardiology out of concern about my slow heart rate and that I have been waiting for an appointment since January. Then have to wait for him doing my discharge letter. He goes over my ECG readings and explains them to me. He said that an ablation would stop the ectopic beats and future AF. I said that they would not consider it for me as many are much worse than me and can't get it done. He said to wait until after the 7 day monitor depending on the R test I might be able to argue for it. I get a taxi home and have something to eat and we go out for an hour and do some shopping. When I get back I check my BP it is 96/66 heart rate 47. Go figure."

Ok so around mid Feburary, on a doc visit, it was discovered my bp was 135/92. High but stable. Well because, my mom and sister have hbp I freaked! I took my bp repeatedly that night in total disbelief. By the time I was ready to go to bed that night, I blew it up to 156/95. After that because I was so stressed and worried about it my bp became totally unstable. In the next few days my readings were all over the place from, 122/88-168/113! I was so up and down it made me sick. I had so much pressure behind my eyes and head associated with headaches. Needless to say my worse fear came true and my doc put me on meds. Amplodipine (5mg) and Triamterene (37.5-25 mg). I absolutely HATE taking these meds. Within less than a month my bp came down to 110ish/72-86ish. My top number seemed to be pretty stable throughout most days but the bottom seemed to still wanna go a little high. I thought maybe I was ready to get off this crap so, I started cutting the pills in half for a week. Then just stopped taking them. Well I lasted for about a week, and that bottom number started going high again causing the top to go up too. I'm back to taking the full pills again. How long does it take for bp to stabilize? I'm trying to eat more fruit, veggies, drink more water etc. Before all this I was abusing saline laxatives, getting hardly any sleep, and had not too long before come off energy drinks. When would the doctor think it's time to cut my dosage in half or take me off the pills? Would my blood pressure have to become super low? Should my bp be stabilized by now? Why won't my bottom number come down like the top? Everyone keeps saying because, I'm stressing about it. When I stopped the meds I was nervous and didn't trust my body to be able to do it on it's own. Sure enough I started feeling pressure in my head and my bp started doing waves again. Anxiety can't do this to you? Does anxiety and worry control the bottom number? I don't want to have to take this medicine forever. It's awful. Now that I'm back on the meds my bp ranges from 99-116/65-88. Will I ever be able to get off the meds? I am in a HUGE depression spiral right now, but it's mainly due to my bp."

Aged 12 I developed complex regional pain and have problems with my autonomic nervous systemWhen I was first diagnosed locally a 24hr halter and tilt tables showed my BP was highly erratic to the point where it generally was high but there were 3 or 4 instances where it fell as low as 55/37 with a pulse around the 200 markMy local hospital were worried that beta blockers, sertraline or clonidine usually used in treatment of POTS would not be adviseable and I was referred to a specialist autinomic unit in London who tried to repeat the 24 hr halter but the arm cuff either blew up too tight and my arm turned blue or kept reinflating but gave error readingsI went for the results yesterday. They took my bp stiing at 154/117 and asked me to stand for 2 minutes and again 3 cuffs and 2 machines failed to obtain a readingAt the appointment I was shown my 24 hr trace but it didnt show much as the readings were taken 30 minutes apart and the cuff had to be removed after 7 hours so we only had evening and nightime readings. It showed mild hypertension and a high baseline heartrate so they are starting me on propranololMy concern is this wildly erratic BP. Its worse in the day but the hospitsl say everyones BP fluctuates. When I said it changes from 60/40 to 190/130 in 3 minutes they looked at me like I am making it up so Im pretty puzzled tbhI have a home monitor my local hospital advised me to get so I can check how things are when I feel poorlyThese are readings at 9pm yesterday laid on the bed watching TV all taken 5 mins apart (bp followed by heart rate)170 106 99151 94 119181 124 115145 61 125169 103 136100 62 100161 97 140150 126 107Has anyone experienced similar or have any idea what is happening.London did blood tests which the ruled out adrenal tumors with.

I am 32 now. I've been with my doctor for over 6 years, she's great and very understanding -- always reassuring me that I am healthy. I went to ER for different reasons and EKG always normal.I've been seeing therapist for over 2 years now and have been taking xanax. Which helped me gain weight from 150 to 170 in 2 years. I've always had poor diet consisting of fast food, soda, snacks, fatty foods, etc...The xanax helped me relax and stimulate my appetite, thus eating more than ever. Before I was always too nervous to eat.Sorry for rant, but my question is having a 140/83 blood pressure when lipids, diabetes, thyroid, kindey, liver test are all negative a sign of possible heart attack in near future?This morning, my new nurse was this cute attractive lady and I got extremely nervous. My BP test was 140/93, second was 139 and 20 minutes later it was 139. My doc did not seem concern with this. She gave me pamphelt about reducing salt intake and asked me to come back for recheck in 2 weeks. I do not want to label this as white coat syndrome because I've been tested at docs many times.Now my concern is that I will drop dead of heart attack. I have no symptoms of heart disease whatsoever or family history of heart issues. I feel fine, even though I do no cardio or exercising.Here are my blood pressure results throughout the years, yuo can see the increase from when I was only 150lbs til now. I hated being skinnny at 6'0 and only 152, so I was happy to get to 170.Are these numbers concerning or showing a trend to hypertension?

My backstory is that when I went to the doc when I was around 31 he said it was high at 150/90, which was a shock to me. Since until then I've never had a problem.Somehow I seemed to get it under control a year or so later (not sure how) and it was somewhere around 135/80 on average. Still a bit high but ok.But now the doc said it's around 150 again and sure enough when I bought my own monitor it does seem to be that. I've been doing exercise in the last few months and lost about 4 kg's, so was hoping that would get me back into a good zone but the average now is only about 145. Hardly any difference.My BMI is 25.3 (5'9"" and 79kg) so not too bad. Although my waist measurement is 98cm which is apparenty over the 94cm mark that is considered ""fat"". (it is a bit flabby to be honest).I also get kinda nervious taking my BP (even when at home) so could that do anything to the readings?? (higher or lower)Kinda at a loss to get it under control. The doc hasn't put me on meds yet but if I can't get it under control soon I was ask for some myself. Is there anything I'm missing?"

They show an average of mid-high 120's/mid-high80's which compared to where I was a year ago is in my book brilliant. My GP said they are TOO LOW as they should be nearer 150/90.

Not sure this is the right thread since it is more about hypertension. I was in good shape in November and now everything is changed. I was working with weights 4 times a week. eating relatively health, but not perfectly. I was trying to cut down all my sugar, eat more protein, veggies and fruit. I never took any pharmaceuticals not even asprin, but suplements such as vit C, D, probiotics, cranberry (for prevent recurrance of urinary infection).Then all changed. I was going into my medical exam for my immigration to Canada. I went through a wicked blizzard to get there. But they found my PB systolic 155. I have been fighting to get my residency in Canada and living with my wife like a refuge for 12 years here in Canada. I went to check my BP in a drug store and now it was 168 range and I was told to get help. So after Christmas parties which I hate I had and argument with my wife and a night or insomnia. The next day I had BP over 200. SO the emergency doctor gave me ativaan and amlodipine. I thought I had better take it. So he told me to find a family doctor. I did and the night before my appointment I look down and there is an inguinal hernia!! Now I though I was screwed.The doctor did not even care about the hernia, he just said when you get your insurance you can get it fixed just were a belt. At 62 working in the steel shops I was ready to quit. But I found a comfortable belt.Now I can only walk to detress. The doctor had me taking my BP three times a day and I was going into an anxiety spiral. My blood work showed no problem with my cholesterol, lipids or diabetes, so I assume the stress was doing it.I wanted to chuck the BP machine and the amlodipiine made me feel like another person. Dizzy, depressed, out of it. I gave it up and stopped taking the BP readings for 4 days hoping meditation and other things might resolve it. But no I have constant ringing in my ears and growing insomnia problems. I have to take epsom salt bathes and meditate. But the last time I went to the doctor I told him I wanted a new BP med so I am on my 2 day of Valsartan and BP is around 170 /98 range. But I am having poor sleep or no sleep. The doctor offered some psychotropic drugs but since my goal was to stay off pharmaceuticals I said no thanks. I don't want to get hooked on a bunch of pills that can hurt me! i JUST WANT TO GET TO THE CORE OF THE ANXIETY PROBLEM, GET MY BP DOWN AND HAVE MY HERNIA FIXED.... I SO MISS BEING ACTIVE IT IS LITERALLY KILLING ME ( I LOST 25 LBS IN A MONTH) I am in a vicious cycle now. an allopath being pressured into being a pill popper.

The lower reading is less than it was while taking medication and the top reading is about the same as when I was taking the medication. Is this normal? Is it a problem? What could be causing my systolic to be so high when my diastolic is normal? When I was first diagnosed in 1985 the doctor was only interested in the lower number which is fine, is this still the case?"
"Hypertension","Stopping high blood pressure medication and trying a healthy diet","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/stopping-high-blood-pressure-medication-and-trying-a-healthy-diet-313656","I was prescribed Amlodipine back in February this year, started on a low dose then doubled. Taking it for 6 months I sufferred terrible side effects of swelling feet/ankles/legs/insomnia to list a few! I was changed to candesartan in August, which seemed to have few side effects but did not really get my bp down, so the candesartan was doubled. Taking my bp at home I registered that it was in fact higher on the double dose.. we are talking here about readings of as high as177/98. Well... really disillusioned with medication, and somewhat wary of side effects after my experience with Amlodipine I decided to stop medication and have joined slimming world which advocates a very healthy diet ( i had thought I was on a healthy diet until listening to the slimming world advice) I joined 3 weeks ago, having discovered my BMI WAS 31, and that i was apparently 3 stone overweight. I have already lost 5 1/2 lbs and my bp has gone down considerably to regular reading now in the region of 130/70 !!! I have seen my doctor and he is supporting me in my decision. My new diet includes lots of fresh fruit and vegetables, and all lean protein, nothing is banned ,but, and I think this is the key.. I have virtually cut out all processed food/salt/caffeine/sugar/alcohol, ( these foods attract syn points and the aim is to keep your daily syn total low)I wonder if anyone else has tried this idea to improve their blood pressure? If not I suggest you consider it. "

"Hypertension","Sudden Improvement in BP","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/sudden-improvement-in-bp-312298","Hello allJust wanted to share some interesting news about my BP. After 18 months of on and off very high readings over 200 systolic and 90+ diastolic and many different blood pressure lowering pills which caused very unwanted side effects, during the last couple of weeks, I have been seeing a few readings in the low 130's systolic and 68 to 80 diastolic. The very high readings did follow a couple of years with a few shocks with hubby and son's health. However, even before the very high readings my systolic BP was often in the 150's/60's and 70's.I can't pinpoint any one thing that might have helped over the last few weeks but, following the TV programme about high BP a couple of weeks ago, I did up my fresh garlic intake to 2 cloves a day from one, on most days; I increased my celery intake; I took Benecol for 3-4 weeks following a diagnosis of high cholesterol, and started eating 7 almonds a day after a friend said they were believed to lower cholesterol. I have checked online and it appears that they can also help BP. I have recently had 3 sessions at the Gym under GP referral and under the guidance of a member of staff there, but had only had one session when I discovered the lower BP, so I would think that was too soon to have any effect. I stopped the Benecol a couple of weeks ago as I had a bout of severe diarrhoea for a couple of days which was quite unusual for me.The only BP pill I have continued taking is Losartan, being the only one that hasn't produced side effects but which failed to reduce my BP.....until now it seems. The last pill to be stopped, a diuretic called Indapamide, after just 3 weekscaused abnormal blood tests results, worsened my already reduced kidney function, and reduced my sodium levels making me feel quite poorly. My consultant then decided to leave me just on the Loartan until my next appointment by which time he is researching another BP lowering pill to try with the Losartan. As you can imagine, I'm now crossing my fingers that my good readings continue and hoping that something magic is happening and I won't need to add anything else.I hope all this isn't boring, but any suggestions as to what might be the magic ingredient would be most welcome.

Two days later I was admitted to hospital for having a BP reading of 194/126. Tests were ran on my blood, urine, I had an ECG and apart from a high heart rate (over100 BPM resting) I was considered fine and discharged. Following this event I continued with very high BP readings between 160/95 to 180/120 on average. I had a 24 hour BP monitoring done, a 24 hour urine collection, ultrasound on my kidneys and adrenal glands and everything came back normal (apart from my high BP obviously). At this point I went onto drugs, ramipril (increasing weekly with clear blood tests) and lercanidipine. The lercanidipine did not suit me at all so I came off that and went onto beta blockers, bisoprolol (which again, didn't suit me at all) followed by propranolol. I have now just changed from ramipril due to side effects, onto losartan as of today. So now i take losartan and bisoprolol. In terms of side effects, WOW the headaches. I have now gone from radial headaches to sever pinpointed headaches on the left side of my head, sharp shooting pains which make me sensitive to noise and light and make me want to throw up. I have developed a persistent dry cough (hoping this will go now i have stopped ramipril) and my fingers get so cold i can barely move them. I took a prescribed sumatriptan 100mg for the headache today for the first time and although i felt a bit wierd (heaviness in my chest and limbs, tingly prickly skin) the headache did lessen.I am currently under the specialist at the hospital who has arranged for an ultrasound of my heart. There has been mention of tachycardia and cardio myopathy. I don't want to read too much into these as obviously they are not pleasant to have.Anyway, I just wanted to know if there was anyone else out there who is young and healthy and has high BP and knows the cause? My high blood pressure and high resting heart rate has the GP and specialists baffled. This has been going on for months now and my BP is still high. Even on ramipril 5mg and propranolol 3x a day my BP readings today were coming in at 164/110. My resting heart rate has come down to about 60-65 BPM on average. On my way home from the doctors today I almost had a cry as I have just had enough now, i am sick of taking pills and having headaches so bad that they are affecting my job and social life and general overall happiness. Please, any advice on this would be appreciated. Thanks "

I could feel myself getting all worked up almost to the point of trembling/nervous. She took it and sure as eggs are eggs it was high, 160 over god knows what ( I didn't even see ), of course the nurse said yes your right it is high. I then told her I had been in hospital some months previously with Kidney stones and fever etc and that in hospital my BP and heart rate was high, although it did come down somewhat in hospital and they never addressed it, they did however do 2 ECG's there though but didn't say anything was wrong. Back to the Dr's/nurses office, she said she wants me back in a week to do bloods for testing for everything and 24 Hr BP monitor and urine sample. Well, for the next 7 days I am worrying all the time about the 24hr BP thing - ""it will be high all the time, I do a strenuous job so it will always be high "" I'm thinking to myself all the time. So the next feel I go to the nurse, she takes my blood and of course the dreaded BP, to which she said the BP had come down from last week, still high but not as bad. When I asked about the 24 BP monitor she said""oh were not doing that today "", I explained that I didn't think it would work anyway and she is now happy for me to do home readings on my machine. She then took my pulse which was also high at 140, but she could see I was very anxois, she then did an ECG, took it to a DR in next room to look at and the result was OK but fast. My blood results came back a few days ago and all is good except for trace blood in urine sample ( could be to do with my kidney stones ) and to bring in another sample in 2 weeks. I have bought my own blood dipstick test kit yesterday and it read neutral !. Over the past week or so my home BP reading have been between as low as 120/77 and as high as 141/94 with my pulse being between 85 and 105.

Going into his past in a little more detail it sounds as if he hasn’t had a lot in the way of investigations for his hypertension and I am going to arrange an MR scan to address his aneurysm but more importantly whether his renal arteries are involved in it (which might not be apparent from the surveillance ultrasounds he gets) and also to clarify a little more about his liver cysts and in particular the extent to which his kidneys may be involved” MR scan is on Friday but my next clinic appointment is not until mid January.Over the past ten days my average BP reading has been higher at 157/78 compared to 147/78 in the previous two months."

One month ago my bp readings were averaging in the moderate hypertension range. Sometimes spiking to high hypertension. In 4 weeks I have lost 10lbs and now for the first time in years and years I weigh under 12stone. I stopped drinking alcohol and coffee. Gave up processed foods and snacks like crisps etc. Been eating porridge for breakfast, slimming shake for lunch with banana and lean meat with veg for dinner. I also do 30 mins exercise each day. And so here I am a month later and my readings today are 120/76!! Can this just be down to these lifestyle changes? I am still on ramapril and statins.

After the reduction I monitored my BP carefully twice a day and all seemed fine with just a slight rise, to be expected with a lower dose. Then I went away for a lovely holiday for 3 weeks and was horrified on my return to find the BP has risen sharply. Oddly the same thing happened last year on my return from holiday. I find I have wildly fluctuating readings and the diastolic is way too high too, i think. 138/86 was average over just 2 days but there have been readings of 189/97 on occasion. I don't smoke, add salt to my food and am considered thin. I also walk at least half an hour daily. I need another prescription so do i ask for a repeat and wait and see if things settle down or would it be wise to ask for a GP appt and expect an increase in meds?

If you have some advice on where to ask, I would also appreciate.I am a male in my mid 20s and about a week ago got symptoms of high blood pressure (hypertension) including palpitations, head throbbing and readings of up to 180/100. I ran to the A&E at Royal London Hospital who checked my urine, blood and heart (ECG), and read my pressure twice again (it had reduced to avg 135-140/90), ultimately saying that it was ""nothing"" but to follow up with my GP.I never smoke, never drink (teetotaller), but exercise only once a week on the weekend and am a bit overweight due to that and not ideal eating habits. However, starting from some time before the symptoms started, I had started a very healthy diet. Based on various things I read on the internet, my gut feeling is that the symptoms were triggered by this sudden change in my diet, something I did wrong. Maybe I got some ingredient wrong.While waiting for the GP appointment (5 days later) my head throbbing got worse. All this despite eating only healthy food typically recommended to reduce blood pressure (bananas, garlic, vegetarial meals, only salmon or tuna as fish, no added salts, no sugar, no chocolate, no saturated fats, lots of vegetables). So either my diet is wrong or something is extremely wrong in my system.My GP at the Spitalfields Practice checked me - I explained to her everything and she just kept joking in a somewhat patronizing tone that I am too young for any serious illness, that I don't need to see a nutritionist/dietitian, that I only need to monitor my pressure for about a week and then she will decide. She ignored the fact that my head throbbing had worsened and was completely vague about my diet and exercise. Honestly, I felt my GP ignored me and was only following a script.Unfortunately, the last time a GP told me ""oh it's nothing, you are too young for this kind of issue, you are only overly anxious"" I got a chronic movement disorder that lasted for 8 years with pain. Had the GP listened to me, I would have prevented my situation from becoming chronic!I don't want that to happen ever again. I know how dangerous high blood pressure can be, and also the consequences of medical treatment. Many have told me that with my age I should do my best to avoid getting to a stage where I will need medication, but that's what will happen if the NHS and my GP keep ignoring what I tell them.This is why I am ready to pay to get proper advice, to be listened and to not be ignored. I want to do my best to prevent this from getting chronic or worse and get treated naturally.If anyone knows someone, a doctor, a medical centre, a private practice, here in London, who deal with hypertension or related and are more competent and take things more seriously than the NHS, I would appreciate if you could recommend them to me.Thank you very much in advance!"

I said that after chest pains in 1993 I was monitored in hospital for five days before having a stress test where the diagnosed Angina and discharged me with medication and a spray. I did not have chest pain again and my GP said that obviously from my lifestyle that I did not have angina Double false positive he said and that this time he would see me at his hypertension clinic and sort it out once and for all. His Romanian sidekick did not put that in the discharge letter to my GP. He said if he referred every one with high BP to a hypertension clinic the queue would stretch from his surgery to the hospital. The consultants secretary was no more helpful.Over the years I have had many 24 hour monitors where the highs and lows are ignored and I am told that it is the average that counts. That is usually around 140/74In 2011 I was found to have aortic stenosis and had my aortic valve replaced in May 2012. My BP still remained high and consultants and registrars kept on repeating dugs that had previously failed and given me side effects. An angiogram prior to surgery showed my arteries still clear after another false positive in a stress echo cardiogram.NICE recommends that patients with BP over 168 should be referred to a hypertension clinic. Whether that is a high or an average I'm not clear on.I live in East Sussex and Googled hypertension clinics. There seem not to be many of them and found one in Brighton that my GP has now referred me to.I'm not sure what they actually do and fiddling with my meds has been tried a plenty.. I have always had a fairy healthy diet and stopped smoking in 1993. I always walked a lot and have been pretty active. I stopped using salt and sugar in 1983 and very seldom eat processed food."

The same monitors consistently produced only marginal differences between diastolic values.This led me to question the meaning of the systolic readings and how well are they understood.Since pressure is force per unit area, and force is defined as the change of momentum (a product of mass and velocity) with time, the shorter the pumping impulse produced by the heart, the higher the peak pressure. In fact, the theoretical pressure at the very start of the pumping action, when the blood just starts to flow, is infinite!What is measured at the upper arm or wrist is also greatly influenced by the state of the arteries. The stiffer these are the higher the pressure will be. This is due to the fact that stiff artery walls will absorb much less energy than supple ones.And then there is the third major factor – the sensitivity / response time of the measuring instrument.. This can probably explain why, using a number of different makes / types of BP monitors, within a short period and under the same conditions, significantly different systolic BP readings can be produced.However, what matters most is the doubt over the interpretation of systolic BP readings. How many of us are given powerful drugs aimed at lowering pressures produced by nothing more than well functioning hearts."

This has proved to be extremely effective at controlling my BP. I feel that this kind of combination therapy is definitely the way forward rather then huge doses of a single drug. Don't let hypertension get you down - live life to the full!![i:42fa7c4729]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:42fa7c4729]"
"Hypertension","palpitations","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/palpitations-21474","I've just started taking this drug for high blood pressure but I'm also taking something called Atenalol for heart palpitations (awaiting results of tests) but from taking the BP drug on day one, my heart palpitations went from being barely noticable, to very noticable. I'm puzzled as my doctor said both drugs work best in combination with each other. Does anyone have experience of this pls?thanks"
