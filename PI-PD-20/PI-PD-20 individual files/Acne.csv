"Red skin and pimples, rosacea or acne, or some combination?",https://patient.info/forums/discuss/red-skin-and-pimples-rosacea-or-acne-or-some-combination--732853,"16 year old kid, about 3 years ago he was given some prescribed acne meds by his doctor. Now, he has very red cheeks, it looks like he's constantly blushing, and generally red skin on his chin and between his eyebrows. Along with that, he tends to get pimples (some blackheads, some inflamed whiteheads) on his chin, in the same general area as the redness on his chin. The acne meds don't seem to be helping too much, it's just a twice daily face wash and clindamycin phosphate topical lotion. Haven't been to the doctor's recently, not sure if I even want to take him with all that's going on. He's never had acne on his cheeks where that red is, yet nothing seems to help. Wondering whether anyone might have any ideas as to if the acne meds could be worsening the redness if it is rosacea, or if something stronger is needed if it's acne. Thanks for any help!"

Alternative treatments to Isotretinoin?,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/alternative-treatments-to-isotretinoin--733305,"Maybe I am being too hopeful here but I would like to know if there are other treatments for Acne which is nodular and cystic/boils, other than Isotretinoin and all its variant names.I've been given 10mg starting dose of the drug by my Dermatologist a few weeks ago but I haven't taken it mostly because I worry about the side effects. I will be having a consultation soon with them on the phone and wonder how to explain to them why I haven't taken it so they will understand.I've been through a difficult time right now being stressed often with low mood, and been more anxious since the current events. And I thought taking this particular drug at this time would be a extra weight on my shoulders monitoring for side effects and I have dry skin already from eczema so taking this drug has been such a dilemma for me.I've suffered from bad acne suddenly since August last year. It is localised mostly on my face and cheeks but particularly bad on my neck and I've got scars from it. I took Lymecycline for a few months but it made no difference, the same with an over-the-counter cream.I get consistent whiteheads forming in different locations on my face but the worst are the nodular ones which turn into boils on my neck and these are quite common..I know I've been offered a treatment plan for it but as mentioned I am reluctant because of the side effects and my family think I should try everything before taking it.Are there other prescriptions such as topical Retinoids that could help, without serious potential side effects like Crohn's disease? What other treatments help? I've consumed dairy products for many years without bad acne and eaten the same foods for many months so it isn't likely to be dietary. Or maybe it is more stress or hormone related. What should I say to my Dermatologist? He says things like the topical solutions won't help without explanation."
My Isotretinoin (Roacccutane) treatment has been interrupted by lockdown,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-isotretinoin-roacccutane-treatment-has-been-interrupted-by-lockdown-733005,"I have been taking Isotretinoin (Roacccutane) for forty-four days now. I was first prescribed this medication on the 25th February, two months after my initial appointment with the dermatologist. So far, I have seen an improvement in my acne. My skin and scalp are very dry. There has been no change in my mood and I don't think I have any other side effects from taking it. Acne has affected my life for so long and I was happy that I was finally starting to see a change!The dermatologist was very reluctant to prescribe me the medication as the results of my initial blood test revealed I had high cholesterol. Never the less, I was initially prescribed Isotretinoin for 30 days (but was given 56 capsules) and would need a monthly review. I was due a second blood test on the 16th March and a follow up appointment on the 27th March, however due to coronavirus those appointments were cancelled and since then I have had radio silence from the dermatologist. With total appreciation and understanding of how busy everybody at the NHS is right now, I must admit that I do feel as if I have fallen through the net.Due to how serious this drug is I was told that I would need to be monitored on a monthly basis. That I would have been prescribed more medication depending on the results of my blood tests and how well I was reacting to the treatment. The dermatologist herself listed a whole bunch of scary side effects and I had to sign form to acknowledge this. So with that, I wonder how a patient taking a drug that is labelled with such adverse side effects can just be put aside and forgotten about. I have waited a long time to get this medication and it's also disappointing that the journey is about to come to an abrupt end just as I was starting to see results!I was just curious to know if anybody else has found themselves in this situation?"

what are your thoughts on Accutane? is this severe acne?,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/what-are-your-thoughts-on-accutane-is-this-severe-acne--729309,"I never used to suffer from severe acne like this as far as I can remember. I did get bad acne as a teenager but not red, cystic bunches like this. For several months I've had on and off pimples or whiteheads, mostly being on my face. But now they are nodular and recently came in lumps especially on my neck. Most of my acne is on my face and neck but I get it on my shoulders and upper arms too.It did start to happen when I was running into financial difficulty looking for work, working a stressful job and thinking about rent payments. I suppose the cause is emotional. I'm feeling better but the acne keeps coming back.My dermatologist suggested me to try Lymecycline antibiotic. I took the whole course but it didn't clear my acne. He then suggested I try Accutane on a low dose after noticing my lumps (not from these pictures though) I recently gave up a blood sample for it and seeing him mid March. I am nervous taking such a drug because of the reported effects and my eczema which has been better recently. My dermatologist really rushes through appointments and I'm unable to get very detailed responses from him, probably as he's always really busy.Do you think its worth taking Accutane for cystic, tender acne like such? Or should I make a GP appointment to get another professional opinion?"

What Could This Rash Be?,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/what-could-this-rash-be--728256,"It used to itch a little bit when I was starting to notice it months ago. This never happened before but it's never gone away and it's progressively getting worse. Now it doesn't itch at all but has definitely gotten both bigger in size, not just overall radius, and has a brighter redness to it now as well. Yes I use soap and I scrub myself.I hope this isn't anything to worry about although for being married a year and a half and now this comes right out of the blue just after a couple suspicious behaviours are brought out from my wife, I do hope that this isn't meaning she's cheating such as with contracting an STD and then sharing it with me but as with no strong reason for suspicion as of yet, I still don't know if she is. I am hoping she is being honest but this does have me concerned about my health. (Pics below).Also, we are both 24 years old, this rash or whatever it is has only shown up on my butt and I have fairly good hygiene.

Ive started taking multivitamins (without iodine and low biotin), zinc, and fish oils, Ive cut out dairy from my diet, I try to drink as much water as possible, I exercise, I wash and change my pillow cases more often, I wash my beard,, but im getting more and more acne than i did before.Im just sick of seeing my face look gross while everyone is enjoying flawless skin.

Anyway, I had to stop taking it 3 months ago. Within a month my skin was getting oilier with few small spots.

My chest and back are now spotty, and my face in addition to being extremely oily is covered in spots. My chin is by far the worst with big, red, cystic acne.Is there any hope that this will settle down in time or was the pill just masking my problem this whole time? More than the acne for me the worst part is my greasy skin.I can't go on to an alternative OCP at the moment. I'm using benzoylperoxide gel but it'snlt as effective as I'd hoped.I know there are many worse problem to have than something so superficial but its so damaging to confidence. I'm 30 and never imagined I'd have bad acne at this age.

"It won't go away, how may acne and sex be related?",https://patient.info/forums/discuss/it-won-t-go-away-how-may-acne-and-sex-be-related--651638,"This question has been circling in my mind for a while now...?Is the fact I’m having more sex than I've ever had, the reason I’m getting way more acne Keep reading if you have used Clindamycin Phosphate. (I need advice)I’ve never had any huge breakouts for most of my life. Always had clear skin. Until I met someone and decided to go on to the implant, which I was using for probably 1-2 months, I hated the implant and had it removed as fast as they allowed me to. They tell us that the hormones leave your body, but I’m not sure if they have? Or if the implant (implanon) has caused permanent damage. I have been vegan/vegetarian for over a year, but recently in August 2017 I gradually went gluten free and unfortunately I wasn’t watching what I was eating for a few months. Gluten free products are processed, packed with tonnes of sugar and unhealthy fats which can cause candida overgrowth which can eventually lead/trigger leaky-gut-syndrome thus leading to acne (your body begging to be healed)I had already been causing my gut damage from being raised eating grains and dairy for years, thank god for books and articles!I also meditate a lot and raise my vibration emotionally/spiritually so my body physically cannot eat low vibrational foods such as junk food, processed meats, dairy products, dairy free products, soy, soy lecithins, soya beans, tea, coffee, chocolate ( a part from one chunk of raw dark chocolate without soy/soy lecithins), biscuits or cheap poorly manufactured foods, phytates, etc. Grains have changed – they are not what they used to be. Wheat (heavily modified), barley, maize, rice, oats all contain proteins and other dodgy things that are extremely irritant for the gut wall and gut bacteria. - My source here: http://popthepimple.com/how-to-heal-gut-for-clear-skin/So back to the acne and sex situation... For months me and my boyfriend were staying up late sometimes 1-3 am sometimes 4-5am because he had work until late (massage therapist) We were eating Red Thai curry with rice (GRAINS, SUGAR, FAT, GRR) without realising the damage this was doing. Bad habits... fun at the time. We once had an indian with dairy in :O I had serious cramping it was not healthy.I hadn’t been exfoliating or using any products consistently either - but I am now. My routine is actually working for me and my skin is starting to clear slightly.?I use a washcloth in the mornings with water, then I cleanse using only water. (I might step up to a chemical exfoliant eventually) ?I exfoliate with the washcloth in the evenings too, and then cleanse using biodermas gentle cleansing gel then wash it off thoroughly, splashing my face 8-10 times with water.I splash my face with water to keep some moisture on my face and use a humectant before applying a moisturiser. Plus some good quality sun screen. (these tips I learnt from olena beley on youtube) - source - http://popthepimple.com/how-to-moisturize-like-a-pro/I keep a food diary... I know my good and bad days.I've started working out 5 times a week. (cardio, yoga, walks)I stick to time-restricted eating. Which everyone should do!!This is where you are supposed to eat in a 8-12 hour gap. Your liver has a circadian rhythm too! Not just the brain...( also learnt from olena beley) I do not eat anything processed any more, I eat fresh vegetables and fruit religiously! Around 5-7 a day of vegetables. I try to eat a small amount of fruit because fructose is still sugar (inflammatory) and I use lots of herbs and spices. Maca, hemp, linseed etc in breakfast smoothie. Healthy fats only. I currently take Optibac probiotics to help balance out bad bacteria in my gut (saccromyces boulardii) with vitamin D, zinc, vitamin C ( all I can afford right now but I plan to take all of the below) However, everyone who suffers with acne is deficient in: ?Magnesium (even non-acne sufferers)Vitamin DVitamin CIronZinc?Glutathione (antioxidant)?L-glutamineNCASo the main worry and anxiety I have is the acne and sex correlation.My partner and I have a age gap relationship which makes me think that his gut bacteria, which can be found in his digestive tract (saliva) is contaminating me whenever we are kissing, as he is older he's had a lot more time to eat junk and not take care of his gut flora... and I feel like i'm the one suffering, especially long tongue kissing... Also, when we have oral sex I get a yeast infection or just generally itchy down there. We also sometimes have sex 2 times a day or it can even be 3-4 times a day if we have time. This isn't everyday. The days we are apart my acne starts to heal (I don't know if i'm imagining it) But we have sex lots during the week because we are quite horny for each other....and he also has stubble (which is irritating to my skin and stimulates oil production, clogging the pores) he is being respectful and not kissing me too roughly any more and avoiding getting saliva on my face/grabbing my face during sex.But sometimes I still feel sore around my chin after a long session of making out and love making ( it feels so unavoidable )He is so understanding and listens to me and we have been cooking healthy food when I stay over (which is 3-4 times week) he is making an effort. He used to be super healthy and on a raw food diet but before he was with me due to circumstances he developed bad/lazy eating habits.?Also to prove candida overgrowth: he has athletes foot. So, my main questions are:Is there any ?evidence to prove the relationship between lots of sex and acne outbreaks??Why isn't this a largely spoken about topic?Also who has used: Clindamycin Phosphate? I'd like to know other people's experiencesAre my hormones going crazy because of all the sex? Should I take a break from sex and see if my acne goes away? The thing that makes me worry is that he would lose interest or it would kill the spark if we can't even kiss because it's causing breakouts. He loves shoving his tongue down my throat ... often. Ha ha!Has anyone else experienced a problem with sex and acne? Hormonal acne that just doesn't go away? Implant removal acne? Please help!"

"ACNE: CAUSES, TREATMENT, AND TIPS",https://patient.info/forums/discuss/acne-causes-treatment-and-tips-672488,Acne is another most annoying diseases especially for girls but for men too because I myself also had this disease. Acne destroys the beauty of a person`s face and when it is removed permanent spots most of the time finds its home in your face which is very hard to remove. Teens and Pre-Teens mostly have acnes but adults also face this sometimes.CAUSES OF ACNE?Due to dirt or waste chemicals human skin produces an oily liquid called sebum which carries dead skin cells follicles to the surface of your skin. Follicles connect the oil glands under your skin to the pores of the skin. When follicles get blocked then the oil under your skin starts to store for which pimples or acnes starts to grow on your face. Another reason is the hormonal changes that occurs to the teens which comes with puberty. As the body starts to grow mature and develop more oil sebum starts to store for which the pores become clogged. Most of the time permanent spots remain in your face even if acne is removed or destroyed.www.healthpiller.comTHE OTHER CAUSES FOR ACNE ARE FOR:Oily Beauty ProductsIrregular Periods (Menstruation) for girls onlyMental Stress and DepressionImproper DigestionLack of Water present in your body (Dehydration)https://healthpiller.com/acne-causes-treatment-and-tips/

Roaccutane ruined my life,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/roaccutane-ruined-my-life-103826,"Whilst I realise the good that this drug does a lot of people (including myself as it cleared up my acne permanently), I feel like I should share the negative side effects of this drug, as the impact it has had on me has been really quite severe.I am now 32 and was prescribed Roaccutane at the age of 18, just before leaving home and going to university. At the time I didn't realise it was the drugs, but they gradually caused me to withdraw from everyone and everything due to the effects it had on me both physically and therefore mentally.To start with, it caused external skin issues such as dry skin, eczema, sweating and blushing - I used to be so confident but would suddenly blush when spoken to, for no apparent reason, which often caused me to literally run away in panic. This blushing issue became worse and worse, so I then grew extremely anxious that it would happen all the time, which of course it therefore did. I avoided people and became shy and introverted during what should have been the most exciting time of my life so far.It also caused me to break out in a severe heat rash whenever I went out in the sun, to the extent that I began to hide myself away in my room with my curtains closed whilst everyone else went out to the fields to enjoy the day and socialise - I normally would have loved to be involved in this, as I was sociable and fun to be around, but instead I became lonely, miserable and probably ""weird"" in the eyes of everyone else.After just one term of uni, I had stopped going to lectures and was thrown off my course. I decided to start a new course the following academic year (telling my parents that teaching wasn't for me, so I'd try a Business degree instead), but I found immediately that I still couldn't attend lectures and was therefore thrown off that course too. I was terrified to tell my parents, because I knew they'd be so disappointed, so I lied to them continually which caused my anxiety to soar. I spent most of my time in my room on my own. I would sleep all day long, go out every night with the few friends I had left, I was drinking a great deal, and I was so insecure and lacking an ounce of confidence that I became promiscuous.I got myself into a load of debt with credit cards, since they were practically thrown at students back then, and basically wasted almost two years of my life on a downward spiral.The physical symptoms worsened and continued for years after I'd stopped taking the meds, and I have absolutely no doubt at all that they triggered the bouts of severe depression that I consequently experienced (I've attempted suicide three times in the past) and also my seemingly never-ending anxiety. Until I took Roaccutane, I was a joyful, confident, fun, life-loving girl.Although I thankfully no longer experience the blushing, the sweating, the heat rashes or the eczema, I still have to apply lip balm every half an hour otherwise my lips dry out completely - if I were ever to go anywhere without it, I'd probably have a meltdown!Overall, the Roaccutane did what it was supposed to do - it cleared up my acne - but if I could turn the clock back and never take the stuff, I would. I seriously believe that if I hadn't taken it, my life would have turned out very, very differently - and most definitely for the better. "

Acne Jaslin How To Removal Blackheads & Whiteheads On The Face Easy Acne Treatment On Face 2018,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/acne-jaslin-how-to-removal-blackheads-whiteheads-on-the-face-easy-acne-treatment-on-face-2018-631514,"What Causes Acne? Your skin has tiny holes called pores, which can become blocked by oil, bacteria, dead skin cells, and dirt. When this occurs, you may develop a pimple or “zit.” If your skin is repeatedly affected by this condition, you may have acne. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, acne is the most common skin condition in the United States. Although acne isn’t a life-threatening condition, it can be painful, particularly when it’s severe. It can also cause emotional distress. Acne that appears on your face can impact your self-esteem and, over time, may cause permanent physical scarring. There are many effective treatments for acne that reduce both the number of pimples you get and your chance of scarring. What Are the Symptoms of Acne? Acne can be found almost anywhere on your body. It most commonly develops on your face, back, neck, chest, and shoulders. If you have acne, you will typically notice pimples that are white or black in appearance. Both blackheads and whiteheads are known as comedones. Blackheads open at the surface of your skin, giving them a black appearance due to the effect of oxygen in the air. Whiteheads are closed just under the surface of your skin, giving them a white appearance. While whiteheads and blackheads are the most common lesions seen in acne, other types can also occur. Inflammatory lesions are more likely to cause scarring of your skin: Papules are small red, raised bumps caused by inflamed or infected hair follicles. Pustules are small red pimples that have pus at their tips. Nodules are solid, often painful lumps beneath the surface of your skin. Cysts are large lumps found beneath your skin that contain pus and are usually painful. What Causes Acne? Acne occurs when the pores on your skin become blocked with oil, dead skin, or bacteria. Each pore on your skin is the opening to a follicle. The follicle is made up of a hair and a sebaceous (oil) gland. The oil gland releases sebum (oil), which travels up the hair, out of the pore, and onto your skin. The sebum keeps your skin lubricated and soft. Acne can be caused by one or more problems in this lubrication process. It can occur when: too much oil is produced by your follicles dead skin cells accumulate in your pores bacteria builds up in your pores All of these problems contribute to the development of pimples. A zit appears when bacteria grows in a clogged pore and the oil is unable to escape. What Are the Risk Factors for Developing Acne? Myths about what contributes to acne are quite common. Many people believe that foods such as chocolate or French fries will contribute to acne. While there’s no scientific support for these claims, there are certain risk factors for developing acne. These include: hormonal changes caused by puberty or pregnancy certain medications, such as certain birth control pills or corticosteroids a diet high in refined sugars or carbohydrates, such as bread and chips having parents who had acne Young people are most at risk for developing acne during puberty. During this time, your body undergoes drastic hormonal changes. These changes can trigger oil production, leading to an increased risk of acne. Hormonal acne related to puberty usually subsides or at least improves when you reach adulthood. How Is Acne Diagnosed? If you have symptoms of acne, your doctor can confirm your diagnosis by examining your skin. Your doctor will identify the types of lesions and their severity to determine the best treatment. How Is Acne Treated? At-Home Care You can use a number of self-care activities at home to prevent pimples and to clear up your acne. Home remedies for acne include: cleaning your skin daily with a mild soap to remove excess oil and dirt shampooing your hair regularly and keeping it out of your face using makeup that’s water-based or labeled as “noncomedogenic” (not pore-clogging) not squeezing or picking pimples, which spreads bacteria and excess oil not wearing hats or tight headbands not touching your face Medication If self-care activities don’t help with your acne, a number of over-the-counter acne medications are available. Most of these medications contain ingredients that can help kill bacteria, open pores, or reduce oil on your skin.

The T-Zone on my face consists of mostly oily skin, especially forehead. If I get a pimple, 90% of the time it is present on the forehead. Otherwise, I generally get one around the lower part of my face.I used ProactivMD for 12-13 weeks, and it worked some. However, there were several areas it could not clear up. I went to a dermatologist, and she classified my acne condition as mild with mostly whiteheads present. She prescribed me Tretinion 0.05% cream and Clindamycin Phosphate 1% lotion. I have been applying both as needed, and have seen a little improvement so far. I have been on both for almost a week. Here is my daily routine. Please critique me where needed.AM:-ProactivMD Deep Clean Skin Wash (using up the rest of the bottle), then will switch to CeraVe Foaming Cleanser afterwards-If going out in not much sun or w/e (like going to work): CeraVe AM SPF 30 sunscreen lotion-If going out to gym or when sun is more present: Neutrogena Clear Face SPF 55 sunscreen lotionSince I currently work 2nd shift at work, I generally wake up, eat breakfast, clean face, apply sunscreen, and drive to gym. During working out, I wear a sweatband and try to pat sweat off face using some paper towels. When finished with workout, I generally use a clean towel, pat off face, then finally dry hair from sweat. I then apply Cetaphil Gentle Cleansing wipe to face. I drive immediately home and then take a shower.PM:-ProactivMD Deep Clean Skin Wash-CeraVe SA Cream (only to other areas of body)-needed med (I wait 15-20 minutes after cleansing face)As far as the meds go..Tretinion cream – I apply 3 nights per week on the entire face. I then apply CeraVe Moisturizing Cream to face (recommended by dermatologist).Clindamycin lotion – I apply once daily on the entire face. If I am going to apply the Tretinion cream the same day, I’ll apply this lotion during the daytime. If not applying that cream, I’ll apply it after cleansing at night. After 10 minutes of applying it, it generally dries up and I’ll apply moisturizing cream to face.Here are some questions regarding the routine:1. Before going to gym, would it be better to: deep clean face at gym before workout and apply sunscreen to “dirty” face before driving to gym. I had some thoughts that the sunscreen might be blocking pores up in heavy sweat, and that it does not need to be on the skin during indoor workouts.2. I generally sweat really easy. It usually starts on the forehead, especially if I have anxiety. If I am at work with CeraVe SPF 30 lotion on my face, and I sweat a little on the face, should I worry about it? I try to pat down with a Kleenex if it happens. What about physical work and sweat is more of an issue?3. Is it okay to keep CeraVe SPF 30 lotion on the face during a 8 hour work shift? I work a desk job, so I very rarely have sun exposure. If not, would it be recommended to cleanse off face with micellar water or cleansing wipe and follow with lotion (around 4-5 hours in)?4. I currently rely on the exfoliating elements of the ProactivMD wash to the face for my exfoliating needs. I read online that it is generally recommended to exfoliate every 3-4 days. Would it be recommended to do so with this regime? How about a weekly mask as well?5. After working out at gym, I'm thinking of using micellar water to cleanse face at gym before taking a shower at home. Would this be recommended? Could I apply a thin layer of sunscreen afterwards to just get by until I get home?Thank you to all! Trying to clear up the acne that is present on my face."

Why isn't his acne clearing up?,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/why-isn-t-his-acne-clearing-up--648210,My son has been on antibiotic since Nov.. He no longer gets the big whiteheads but his face still has acne.. In the morning his face looks clear but then in the afternoon I notice tiny bumps and it's red and blotchy. Why is this? We are using a gentle soap for sensitive skin and the cream the Dr gave us is the lowest dose and we use it every 2 days because it's drying. About 2 weeks ago I emailed pictures to Dr and she switched antibiotics. So we'll see if this helps. It's just so frustrating because it has been about 5 months. My other son had acne but we used a special soap and face cream which cleared up in a few months.Just wondering if others have these tiny bumps and red blotchy skin in the afternoon.

I am a 25 year old female, and about 5 week ago I started getting hard, unpopable bumps on my cheeks and one on my forehead. They were painful and big, and I am still dealing with the scars. They flattened out and are still red, but I thought my skin was getting better and healing. Like I said, I don't get very much acne, so this is new to me. About 4-5 days ago I noticed I started getting a few bumps on my cheek again. Nothing like the hard ones before, but they never came to a head, either. More and more unpopable bumps keep forming on my cheeks and under my eyes. Some of them are small and skin coloured, but this is seriously depressing me. I don't know what could be causing this and I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I've made an appointment with a dermatologist, but I have to wait 8 days to see her, so I wanted to ask all of you here what you might think is going on.-----I take MONONESSA birth control pills every morning.

Roaccutane - joint/muscle pain after only 1 week,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/roaccutane-joint-muscle-pain-after-only-1-week-641255,"My daughter, aged 16, has had moderate, persistent acne for over 2 years and nothing has worked on a long term basis. She has scarring on her forehead. She was finally referred to a dermatologist who recommended Roaccutane.She started 1 week ago on 20mg daily but within days was experiencing lower back and joint pain. She rated this on a scale as 5 out of 10 for pain and said she “felt like an old woman”. She isn’t an active girl, no sports etc, but has a weekend housekeeping/waitressing job which is light duties only. I called the dermatologist who said it was unusual to have so much pain (in the absence of strenuous exercise) and to stop for a week to see if pain subsides. If it does, to return using 10mg daily for two weeks then alternating 10mg and 20mg for a further fortnight. Daughter is frustrated that she’s in so much discomfort. We expected dry skin/lips and have been adequately prepared for that. We knew joint/muscle pain was a possibility too (and are vigilant for many of the other side effects too) but we didn’t expect it to develop so quickly and to be as sore. Has anyone else experienced this to such a degree? She would be devastated if Roaccutane wasn’t suitable for her but I am worried about her enduring this sort of pain (and indeed whether it goes after completing the course). Thanks"
Roaccutane Severely damaged lips ,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/roaccutane-severely-damaged-lips-524357,"**Extremely sore lips**I have been on Roaccutane twice (April - October 2015 (40mg) & May - June 2016 (80mg)). I stopped taking the tablets In June 2016 for two reasons; my skin was clearing up and secondly because my lips were becoming unbearable with the pain that my dermatologist recommended. The problem started after I stopped my first cycle back in October 2015, the skin on my lips were more dry than usual and would easily fall off if they got damp but I was able to maintain them if I constantly moisturized and didn't bite them. As the months went on I noticed they were getting worse, the skin was weaker and more of it was coming off so I visited my Dermatologist who advised me to use Bepathen. So I tried that and it didn't work so I tried different balms like beeswax and natural honey. I saw some improvements but if I took a shower skin would fall off and I would just go back to square one so I just started to ignore it and get on with my life. When I noticed my acne was getting really bad in March this year, even worse than the first time I was prescribed In April 2015, I started taking roaccutane again and that's when my lips got severe. My lips were already fragile so the tablets on top made my lips even worse; the skin is extremely raw with burning sensation that is unbearable at times. It's mainly in the center of my lips, top and bottom where the skin constantly peels off from the contact of water and food resulting in a weeping residue which then turns into a thin white layer over the lips. No matter how gentle I apply balms the skin instantly comes off; it feels like the wound is deeper as if more layers of skin has come off. I obviously made a stupid mistake by upping my dose from 40mg to 80mg without my dermatologists consent, I couldn't deal with the stress and anxiety that it caused me once before so I thought if I doubled the dosage it would heal quicker, which it seemed like it did but my lips paid the consequences. So it's been 3 weeks since I stopped accutane and my lips still won't heal and I don't understand why nothing is working I tried many products; Hydrocortison 0.5%, clotrimazole 2.0%, Vaseline, beeswax, Honey etc. My dermatologist assured me I don't have a fungal, bacteria infection or an allergic reaction but I know that this is not normal. I would like to know if anyone has any suggestions with creams (steroid's) I should try with dietary recommendations? I do eat well with a balanced diet and vitamin supplements but my immune system isn't the best. My lips are covered in Vaseline and Hydrocortison 0.5% so I can't take a photo right now - apologies. I really need help, I feel so uncomfortable to leave my house as I suffer from anxiety. Thank you for reading"
"Information on the causes of acne, and what treatments are available - includes home remedies",https://patient.info/forums/discuss/information-on-the-causes-of-acne-and-what-treatments-are-available-includes-home-remedies-645338,"Remedies For A Smoother Skin. Do you have acne ? Acne maybe the scourge of adolescent years, but it can follow people into middle age and beyond. Acne is really a catchall term for a variety of symptoms such as pimples, whiteheads, and blackheads. It's a condition where the pores of skin become clogged and the person gets inflamed and non-inflamed lesions. So what's the cause of all the clogging ?...... Heredity - at least for the most part. Acne is genetic - it tends to run in families, it is an inherited defect of your pores. If both your parents had acne, three out of four of your brothers and sisters will get it too. Factors that can aggravate an acne outbreak are :- Stress, sun exposure, seasonal changes, and climate can all precipitate an acne attack. Certain types of makeup and taking birth control pills can also cause a breakout. Change Your Make-up In adult women, make-up is the major factor in acne outbreaks, especially oil based products. It's the oil that causes the problem. The oil is usually a derivative of fatty acids that are more potent than your own fatty acids. Use a non-oil-based make-up if you are prone to acne. Read The labels. Cosmetic products that contain lanolins, isopropyl myristate, sodium lauryl sulphate, laureth-4 and D & C red dyes should be avoided. Like oil, these ingredients are too rich for the skin. Wash Properly. Wash your make-up off thoroughly every night. Use a mild soap twice a day and make sure you rinse the soap entirely off your face. Rinse six or seven times with fresh water. Use Less Make-up. Whatever make-up you use, try to cut down on the amount you put on. Leave Well Alone. Don't squeeze pimples or whiteheads. A pimple is an inflammation, and you could add to the inflammation by squeezing it, which could lead to an infection. A pimple will always go away in one to four weeks if you leave them alone. Know When To Squeeze. Most pimples are best left alone, but there is one kind that you can squeeze to help get rid of it. If the pimple has a little central yellow pus head in it, then a gentle squeeze will make it pop open very nicely. Once the pus pops out, the pimple will heal more quickly. Attack Blackheads. You can also get rid of blackheads by squeezing them. A blackhead is a very blocked pore, and a gentle squeeze will help rectifty this. Give Dry Skin Extra Care. Dry skin can be sensitive to some over the counter skin treatments, so please use these treatments with care. Start with the lower strength products first, and then increase the concentration slowly. Stay Out Of The Sun. Acne medications may cause adverse reactions to the sun, so minimize you exposure until you know what the reactions going to be. Use One Treatment At A Time. Don't mix treatments, use only one at a time because they may cause an adverse reaction if mixed together. Stop The Spread Of Acne. Apply acne medication about half an inch around the affected area, to help keep the acne from spreading. Acne moves across the face from the nose to the ear, so you need to treat beyond the inflamed area. Most people make the mistake of treating only the pimples and not the outlaying areas of skin. This is wrong. If you are an acne sufferer, then I trust this information will be very helpful to you.

The acne spreads to the face, neck, shoulders, arms (up until the elbow, some beyond it), chest (more prominent in the upper chest), and back (all over). In some instances, it reaches until the buttocks. I wouldn't say I have a healthy lifestyle, as in the past years I have been somewhat an insomniac (sleeping around 11-3, sometimes 4, sometimes never), and almost never eat fruit, mostly eating burgers, fries, typical stuff, but I stay away from junk food (chips). I live in the Philippines, so there's the idea of the climate. And we've tried using products such as sulfur soap, face cleansing liquids that are applied with cotton, and face wash (if that's what it's called?).

Scalp acne,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/scalp-acne-626431,"Hi, and thank you for any responds or hopefully help If I will see! So basically I'm going to be 19 in few months and from 12 I became poor kid with acne. Of course it began with few white pimples and then the massacre began all the s**t for years and years... Never really had on my chicks but mostly on my forehead, nose and lips area and my upper neck area where my ears are, and then back. My family was always on the natural stuff, so we were trying to solve it with aloes and other stuff. It didn't really helped me a lot, so I decided to go with medication prescribed by my doctors, something that just wasted money and time and stress and overall hope. I decided to just wait it out until It will go out ""nature way"" and just grow out of it, until one day I got itchiness in my scalp, when I was around 17. I don't really know what was it, first I was like I got infection from my visit from barber, when I was getting hair cut. But I took it as some dandruff or something, or just some fungus infection that will last most of 2 weeks. After 2 weeks it didn't stop (during that time I already visited dermatologist and he prescribed me tons of dandruff shampoos which didn't really helped me) and then my acne came along with it, white pimples and then hair loss. Next doctors said it's caused with my acne problem and blablablabla, so I got prescribed some next light drugs which didn't help me, and just made me feel even more bad. I was always against doctors because I feel they are like robots prescribing what the system thell them, and never really investigate what kind of scalp problem I have. They would investigate 20secs and say take this drug for 6 months and see me after that if it got better. So here I am for people with good heart, to help me solve this problem. I would like to mention that I'm on strict diet for 3 years, no fast food / sugar / no sweet any soda nothing. Just vegetables sometimes diary breed and honey and I cut off coffee and just drink tea occasionally. Acne made me have a really healthy lifestyle which helped me get rid of most face acne and back but my scalp is getting worse and worse and I don't think I can get any help from my doctors."

Well it's a big deal and if you're anything like me you must have spent hours upon hours on Google trying to find out as much as possible about it and what to expect. I've seen some people really support each other through the good and the bad times in their 6 months journeys on accutane in old forums online so I'm hoping someone out there has started more or less now like me and wants to share worries and successes. I am just finishing my first week on 20mg. I'm one of the lucky ones; I only have mild acne on my face but it's a persistent fckr! I also have HS (hidradrenitis suppurativa- which manifests itself every year or so in a lovely huge abscess that has to be incised and drained) so the idea was to kill both these ugly birds with the nuclear option. I am sure wars have been started on less preparation than mine about this treatment. Have all my vitamin E and B, non comedogenic but hydrating moisturisers and mild washes and lip balms and even a special nivea lip balm shaved down just to fit inside my nostrils as I can't be getting nose bleeds! My own nose balm! All a bit much right? I know. I'm just freaking out a little given the gazillion side effects and the fact that my few spots here or there don't justify just a drastic measure. But I have genuinely tried everything else including antibiotics and treclin more recently. And as I said, this should get rid of the HS too.So, first week in and so far, so good. No symptoms yet.

Can I afford it - not really, but I would honestly live on plain pasta for the next 6 months just to have clearer skin. If I see a private derm, and I am paying, can I be like look Roaccutane is the only thing that works, get me on it. My fear is that I will spend a ridiculous amount on just the initial consultation for them to be like - no your skin isn't bad enough to go on roaccutane.

Something that has benzoyl peroxide?And another question, do I also need to buy a moisturiser as well?Just seems like a lot of things to put on my face [acne scar removal, acne avoidance cream, and moisturizer], and I'm not sure if this is right or not. I just want to treat the acne scars and to avoid future acne as best as possible.Thanks for any advice."
Acne Scars,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/acne-scars-36006,"Hello,What is the best treatment for acne scars?I have a few which dont seem to want to go away (one for 6 months) and looking for advice of what I can do.Whilst it occurred during an acne onset, i did not irritate the area however eventually rather than disappearing they seem to have remained in a dark colour on my skin.I have read about different types including laser but not sure it needs to be dealt with at that extreme - maybe something from the pharmacy or doctor?Has anyone experienced this and overcome it.I am male of 34.Thanks."
