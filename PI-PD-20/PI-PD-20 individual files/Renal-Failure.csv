"Renal Failure","Kidney function declining rapidly","Hi everyone,For quite a few months I've not been feeling right. Mainly just unbelievable fatigue, but i run periods where my heart rate fluctuates like crazy, i get palpatations, my appetite just isn't there though it hasn't resulted in weight loss. I had sustained hair loss and i would often get a weird dull feeling on my right side of the back which would at times creep towards the front.I went to the GP in January after having had a period over Christmas feeling very ill with also now daily having had runny stools daily.She ran some blood tests which just showed very low Vitamin D.My iron was stores were high but normal, potassium, albumin, phosphate were all high but within normal range. My creatine was 62 and my gfr was 90.I was given Vit D tablets and sent on my way.Come March I still wasn't feeling right but then lockdown happened, and by this point my heart issues were becoming really pronounced. So after waiting a while longer i went private and had some more blood tests.This time it came back that my creatine was 115, gfr 50, Albumin53, bilirubin now showing up as an issue at 23.Also my iron stores were higher than normal range now.I drink plenty of water, especially now that I can't just pop into any store so I'm certainly not dehydrated.I am not on a high protein diet and nor am i on any medications. I stopped taking the vitamin D when my course ran out in Feb. Any ideas on what this could be? The nurses just seem adamant that it's I am dehydrated and eating a lot of red meat and tell me to retest in 90 days.I am concerned that if i have dropped so much in function in 4 months, come 90 days I'll be worse off."
"Renal Failure","End stage kidney failure","This may sound weird but I'm looking for information about what a persons goes through, physically, when they are about to die of kidney failure, as they tell me I am.Since dead people are hard to communicate with, I was wondering if anyone here has had the experience of going through this with a friend or loved one.I would like to know what, if any, pain is suffered and what physically happens to the body near death.What changes are expected and if there is a time line to the process.I know this may be a tough question for some people, and I apologize in advance, but it's important to me. No, I decided to NOT go through dialysis so no use bringing up the subject.Thanks"
"Renal Failure","Foamy Urine, 16 years old.","Okay so here are the basics:I am 5’11, 180lbs, 20% bodyfat. My blood pressure is 115/70 and my resting heartrate is 68. I had a urinalysis for my foamy urine about 8 months ago but the tests came back fine and I was told not to worry. To this day I still have foamy urine almost constantly (except some mornings). If I drink more water or pee on the side my urine remains foamy. I have no symptoms of swelling or any pain, shortness of breath, etc. and my symtpoms havent worsened over the past 8 months. Any ideas? Im going back in 2 weeks for another urinalysis and a blood check (I had a physical schedueled and thought why not get my blood checked). Any ideas?"
"Renal Failure","Forum/help pls specifically for IgA Nephropathy ? ","Hi everyone. I hope someone can help me please. My 22 year old son has been told he has IgA Nephropathy and his kidneys are functioning at only 30%. He has a biopsy scheduled for next week. I am devastated. He is fit and well with no visible symptoms and this has come completely out of the blue from a medical he had to join the Police. They found microscopic traces of blood in his urine and quite high levels of protein. His BP is slightly raised so he’s been put on ACE Inhibitors. He feels his life is over and we are all so scared. The insensitive specialist even asked him if he realised how serious this is. He had secured his dream job with the Police and now he’s been told he will never be allowed to join the Force and is facing certain dialysis and transplant. We just don’t know where to turn for advice and support. "
"Renal Failure","Help I have a potassium phobia!","Hi I'm 48 and take 20 mg of Benicar. My blood pressure is around 95/65 and my GFR is only 74 (should be 99). Also, my potassium is 4.2 (range 3.5-5). I read that as kidney disease gets worse it becomes harder for the kidneys to eliminate potassium and so I've suddenly become afraid of eating anything with potassium in it, and just about everything has potassium in it so I'm afraid to eat anything for fear of developing high potassium levels. Someone please tell me I'm crazy. I've been in a total panic for 2 days and I can't eat much. I'm drinking water and eating white rice."

"Renal Failure","CBD oil and CKD","Hello to everybody, I'm new to this forum. I'm from Slovenia and I have CDK Stage 3. Did anybody had any expirience or knowledge abut usage of CBD oil wit h CKD. I had only one info :The research was led by a team at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, who studied kidney disease progression in cannabis users. They found that chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients’ kidney function declined faster in those who used cannabis, compared to those who did not.But this research mentioned only cannabis users, no CBD oil, which has nearly no THS, according to our legislation less than 0,2%."
"Renal Failure","COULD IT BE KIDNEY DISEASE","Hi. I'm a 52yr old female & i'm terrified i may have something wrong with my kidneys. Only this morning i went to the toilet as usual & noticed that there was no colour in my urine. It was literally the color of water. Through the course of the day i observed the colour everytime i urinated & only twice did it have abit of normal yellow to it. I live in australia & i rang a nurse & she did an assessment & said that it didn't sound like kidney disease although admitting that she couldn't give me a definitive answer (obviously). I don't have any other symptoms such as swelling in ankles or under the eyes, itchy skin & so on but i'm concerned about the lack of colour as iv'e never had this before. I am making an appointment with my local doctor if things don't improve. Any advice of anyone having anything similar & what was the outcome."

I am lucky in that I have 5 immediate family offering to be Donors / getting tested (although I'm realistic and fully aware its not that easy so may still have to go on dialysis / have a long wait etc).Whilst i wait for this i have started to now get symptoms; severe fatigue, nausea..... you know, all the usual ones you read about. I'm doing everything i can to deal with these (medication / diet / light exercise). i am still working, as a supervisor in an office / call centre environment. Work have been extremely understanding and supportive with everything so far (I've had other complications all linked with renal problems) and they continue to be. Work is becoming increasingly difficult for me, they have already done some workplace adjustments (flexible shifts) and i manage my own tome so i get as much break as i need / want.j am wondering if anyone has any experience or suggestions if what else, if anything, i could possibly do in work to try and make it easier and then not have to take time off.any suggestions you have are welcome, no matter how obscure! I'm willing to try anything and work are really inclusive and go the extra mile so I'm sure they will consider most things.Thanks, Mike.Aged 27Chester, England, UK."

"Renal Failure","Frothy, Foamy Urine","Im 19 and I've been having foamy urine for at least 2 years now. Didn't give it much thought until recently. So about 3 days ago i got my blood and urine tested and results came back negative for protein and glucose. My eGFR was at 130 and my creatinine was at 0.8. Doctor said i was fine and everything looked normal. I'm still worried. I wonder what causes this foam anyways. Btw the only few things that concerned the doctor was my ldl cholesterol levels and uric acid which were slightly above optimal(according to her, nothing that couldn't be fixed with healthier diet). What do you guys think of this odd foam phenomena?"

"Renal Failure","Blood Test GFR low ","Recently I went to the doctors as i had been feeling very fatigued. She did a blood test and the results showed that my kidneys did not appear to be working properly. She said that my kidney filtration rate should be about 80, but mine is 59. My doctor is questioning whether I have chronic kidney disease.If I should be diagnosed with kidney disease, how long is it that I would have had the disease for? Is kidney disease something that progresses slowly over a number of years or can it be quite rapid?If this is what I have, I'm struggling to work out what would have caused it. My blood pressure is up slightly (I've had my blood pressure checked quite a few times over the last few years and I've always been told it's normal). I'm not diabetic and I'm not aware there is any kidney issues in my family. Other levels in my blood tests were normal. Is there anything else that could cause GFR to below? Dehydration?"
"Renal Failure","Small right kidney measuring 88mm","I recently had an ultrasound due to prolonged periods. The U/S showed a thickened endometrium with multiple fibroids and enlarged uterus. Have since had a D&C and all normal. A hysterectomy has been advised by specialist. Now I am concerned because the U/S also showed a small right kidney of 88mm that my doctors were not concerned about because blood tests were OK. I believe the egfr was 87 although not 100% sure. What I was wondering can the person taking ultrasounds take a measurement that is a little incorrect. The U/S report mentioned nothing about seeking further advice for the kidney but did say that a gynecologist should be contacted. Please help as this is starting to freak me out."

My nephrologist says that the condition might or might not progress in the future. Is there any one in this forum, whi was diagnised with this problem or similar very long ago and still doing fine. Does this problem necessarily progress to end stage renal disease? Pl give your valuable comments. Thanks!"
"Renal Failure","Still have blood in urine 20 months after kidney trasplant?","Had a successful transplant in 2016 and a couple weeks later went to get the ureteral stint removed. When the urologist was looking with a scope he said he couldnt find the stint in the bladder! Turns out that the whole stint some how migrated all the way into the new kidney. The only way they could get it out was by cutting a hole into the new kidney. How did this happen? They said everything went good with the removal but since then I've been having blood in my urin and they dont now why.

"Renal Failure","Low GFR on Anticoagulant","My doctor has referred me to a nephrologist and now I'm worried I have kidney problems due to the medicine I'm taking. I'm 66 and in January 2018, I had a pulmonary embolism (blood clot in lung) and was put on the anticoagulant, Xarelto. I had terrible side effects and was just switched to Eliquis at a lower dosage. Before the clot, I was healthy, taking only Vitamin D, non-smoker, normal BP. All my vitals normal & normal blood tests. On the day I had the clot, my creatine was 0.9 and GFR 66.6.

"Renal Failure","Need thoughts about paying for dialysis--I'm in the USA","Okey, I'm turning 65 this week on Friday. My nephrology gist has also made it clear that I could find myself on dialysis fairly suddenly any time now.So I've been looking at insurance and thinking about how I'm going to pay for dialysis. Key points:1. I am still working as a university professor. I plan to work for another 6-8 years.2. I receive health insurance from my job. I'm on Blue Cross Blue Sheild of Kansas, Plan C (This is a high deductible plan with a health savings account.)3. It's my understanding that Medicare will serve as the secondary insurance (after my work insurance has paid what it will toward dialysis) for the first 30 months I'm on dialysis. Then roles reverse with Medicare being the primary insurer with my work insurance picking up the remainder of it is eligible for coverage.4. Once I retire Medicare will only cover 80% of the cost of dialysis. I will be responsible for the remaining 20%, which could be between $20,000 and $30,000 a year. 5. A supplemental insurance policy may pick plus much of the remaining 20%--like a medigap policy; however, the medigap providers do not have to offer coverage if it is outside the open enrollment time period.So my questions:1. Would open enrollment for the medigap policy happen at the time I initially enroll in Medicare Part B when I am initially placed on dialysis?2. If so, am I further ahead to enroll in both Medicare Part B AND a medigap policy as soon as I know I will be placed in dialysis to ensure that I'll have medigap coverage at a reasonable price? (This would negate the need for my work policy/benefit.)Basically, I'd appreciate any words of wisdom you may have. I'd also appreciate contact people and phone numbers I can use to get some accurate and quality information about all of this.Thanks soooo much!!Marj"

"Renal Failure","Does this sound like a potential kidney issue?","Hello all I'm asking this question on behalf of my mum, who is 62 and no particular health problems. I'll keep it brief.Over the past several months she has developed the following symptoms;Urinating less often with a lack of urge to need to pee and only urinating in small amounts.An aversion to eating meatSlight weight gain around stomachSlight intermittent puffiness to face and fingers.For about the past 18 months she has been treated for Rosacea.She was chatting with someone who is a district nurse about diets and mentioned this sudden aversion to meat which she is finding really weird. The nurse said that could actually indicate a kidney issue. As I am diabetic, I had someone protein testing sticks and gave them to her to test her pee. The indicated a moderate level of protein. She saw her GP today. He tested a sample and said there was quite a significant amount of protein. He said this could be an infection and also randomly mentioned the menopause, even though she is well past that. But he's sending the sample off and she is getting blood tests tomorrow for; HbA1C, B12 & Folate, Lipid, U&E, Vit D, Iron, FBC, Liver Function, Calcium, Thyroid.So, questions is, do these generally sound like symptoms that could be associated with kidney issues? She is a bit concerned about being fobbed. Also, are there any blood other blood tests that would be helpful. I know when I go to my diabetic reviews they do my ACR and eGFR, etc. Does anyone know if these will be included in my mum's tests what she is being sent for?Any help much appreciated. "

"Renal Failure","Falling eGFR aged 20","Hi, I’m a 20 year old female who had a nephectomy (surgical removal of kidney) last June. Around Christmas 2017 I began to have pain in my remaining kidney and in April I was found to have an eGFR of 81 which is mildly impaired but I was told not a major concern. I returned for a repeat test in June and my eGFR was 79. 3.5 weeks by another blood test and my eGFR is 65. As I am otherwise fit and healthy and drink approximately 3L of water a day, with a limited salt intake and healthy-low blood pressure I am confused as to why this is happening. My GP is concerned due to my age and no apparent triggers for the falling eGFR as well as only having one kidney left and has referred me for an urgent nephrology appointment. I’m just wondering if anyone else has been through anything similar and what they found the cause to be? Thanks in advance. "

"Renal Failure","Newly diagnosed with CKD stage 3 - at 33 years old","I'm 33 and have an egfr of 38 with a creatinine of 138. My bp is fine at 120/79, I don't have diabetes and am not overweight. I've never had even one UTI. 6 months ago my kidneys were fine. I've had no obvious symptoms, I am tired most of the time but I'm a full time mum to a 2yr old who's a rubbish sleeper and a 4yr old so put it down to that. I have to have repeat bloods on Monday, a scan on Tuesday in my local hospital after and then see the renal team at my nearest unit which is 1.5 hours away within the next 3 weeks. I've honestly never been more scared. I'm praying the egfr will be better after the bloods on Monday but have a horrible feeling they'll be worse. I had been taking a couple of ibuprofen daily or nearly daily for a month or so for a painful tendon in my foot, so the renal team think that might have caused it, even though it was well within the recommended dose and I feel terrible, so terrible, guilty and stupid that I may have damaged my kidneys beyond repair and shortened my life. I can't die, I have two children who need me. The idea I might not see my kids marry or never hold my grandchildren is heartbreaking. I've really struggled with the neediness of my kids as babies and the relentlessness of parenting two toddlers and now they're growing up I've been so looking forward to things getting a bit easier and getting a bit of balance back as I can go to work once they're both at schools. In ten years' time I want to be dashing around taking them to groups and clubs, nurturing their interests, and looking forward to their future, not stuck on dialysis or seriously ill and unable to parent them effectively. I'm also worried the kidney failure is a symptom of cancer, either primary or a metastasis, I know it's rare but someone has to be in that few percent! I'm just so worried what the scan will show.

"Renal Failure","Is my worry for nothing (urine bubbles among other things)","So, i am sorry if i sound a bit panicked, but I am afraid that thanks to Dr. Google, i have myself a bit worried now, and would appreciate some feedback.Some general feedback: I am 34, 320lb (working on it, lost over 15lb so far), have sleep apnea (currently treated), and i suffer from severe health anxiety.. no point in lying about that. Two months ago, for unrelated symptoms, i was seen by a cardiologist, and put on Lisinopril (20mg) for my blood pressure (I feel that i strongly have white coat syndrome, as my BP can be around 130/80 at home when i am relaxed). Because of this, i have also had several blood tests, which have included Kidney tests:3-2-18:Crea: .90 mg/dlBUN: 10 mg/dlPotassium: 3.6 mmol/L3-7-18Crea: .90 mg/dlBUN: 9 mg/dlPotassium: 3.7 mmol/L4-4-18Crea: .92 mg/dleGFR: 108 (i understand the estimate is likely too high based on weight?)BUN: 8 mg/dlPotassium: 4.4 mmol/LGlucose: 115I also had an abdominal UT the last month, where they didn't note anything about the kidneys other than appearing normal (they noted my liver looked fatty).So, everything sounds great, and seems it. I dont have any swelling anywhere either.That said, why am i here? Well, I am worried about the bubbles in my urine. I have noticed that even if i pee gently, i can still see some small bubbles form, and they can stay around. Dr. Google is kind enough to inform me that not only is this bad, but likely significant Kidney disease. Frankly, i would swear i have seen foam before, but admittedly, i haven't given it as much thought until now. I have also been having back pains, which get worse when stretching (problem is, i also have had back pains for most of my adult life.. i can feel my back popping in several places when i sneeze).Otherwise, my function feels fairly regular. i go on average 2-3 hours (though, if i have an anxiety attack, it can make me go more often), don't wake up at night to pee (some mornings it looks more concentrated than other mornings.. the last few days have been lighter in the morning.Sorry for rambling.. where i am now, is i am figuring i have bad CKD despite my bloodwork and UT. I haven't had a urine test (also being honest, i have a kit coming to me tomorrow), so i am even more vulnerable to believing the worst."

We just learned that they are trying to file for an exemption from vaccines for her kid to go to school this year, so it seems like they are set on their decision.I'm at a loss as far as what to do. I've heard from my doctors and nurses from just stay away from people who are visibly sick (a runny nose, fever, etc) to absolutely no contact with unvaccinated children post-transplant. Can anyone tell me what your experience has been posted transplant and what your doctors have told you to do as far as close contacts?My concern is the following, something like the measles might not show any symptoms for weeks, and knowing my niece isn't vaccinated I don't feel comfortable putting myself in a risky situation if she's sick with something like that."

"Renal Failure","Pain after kidney removal","I had my left kidney removed due to finding a tumour on it. This was due to pain on my right rear side feeling as if I had pulled or torn a muscle in this side. Anything like Hoover or moping would activate it. After 8mths I looked into it. Diagnosed via scans. Then having removed the left kidney an lymph node and cancerous tumour, and now just over 3months I'm still getting discomfort on my right kidney rear and at the front lower side. I have not been told by anyone why I had the pain in the 1st place on the opposite side to having tumour and what to expect as you recover from the surgery. I have been very good in not o we doing things and ensuring hydration is a must. Does the other kidney grow to compensate? Is this grumbling pain normal? How long does it take for the discomfort to dissipate? Any help would be appreciated. "
"Renal Failure","EGGR AND CREATININE","SECOND try to write my post! Saw nephrologist in London. Told me that cutting out meat is unnecessary except for 24 hours before a renal blood test and that one glass of white wine with dinner would do no harm. This after I gave up meat and alcohol. My latest test figures show eGFR 44. Creatinine 130. Sodium and potassium well within normal range. I am in The Caribbean at present and they gave a reading for BUN of 29H which is outside the normal range of 7-23 and a BUN/Creatinine Ratio of 22.3 which is within the normal range of 8-36Chloride is 98 ( normal 94-112)CO2 is 26.0 (normal is 21-35)Anion Gap is 9.0 (normal is 4-17)i have never ever heard of BUN OR ANION GAP? Maybe it is an American term? And the only Chloride I know is Sodium? Could this be Phosphorus?i am very surprised that my Creatinine is so high given I am so ancient and I am not muscular and the only exercise I do is walking? I have not eaten any meat for nearly 3 months. I should have asked why my Creatinine is so high as it brings my Efgr down! I am hoping one of the more experienced members here can answer my question. The cardiologist has added Eperenome 25mg to Losartan 100mg and Bisoprolol 5mg to try to get my BP down and this is on top of Furusemide and Warfarin ( metal valve)i would welcome any explanation and ideas about the Nephrologists opinion. He is a leading light in London Nephrology. He thinks if Eplerenome does not significantly reduce my BP I should stop it even though the effect on my efgr is reversible."

"Renal Failure","Phosphorous Binders - Cheap and life-saving","I've been a Stage 5 ESRD patient on dialysis for 4+ years. One thing I have learned about this disease is how important it is to survival to keep your phosphorous levels down! I need to eat a LOT to keep my albumin and weight up, so I am constantly fighting high phosphorous, even though I eat a relatively low-Ph diet. My doctor has me on Phoslo (Calcium Acetate), but even though I take the pills exactly as prescribed, I am still getting high Ph levels because I am not taking enough. The trouble with Calcium-based binders (Phslo or TUMS/Calcium Carbonate) is that you are limited to 1.5g of elemental calcium exposure per day ( a total of about 12 Phoslo, 12 TUMS 1000, or 12 or any combination). After that, or if you eat too much calcium in your diet, and your calcium levels will go up (which is just as bad as high phosphorous).My doctor just kept telling me to take more and more Phoslo, until I had over-run my prescription, was way over my daily exposure to calcium, and started getting more screwed up with each lab draw. I then realized that Phoslo is more than $200 for a month's supply! I thought something must be possible, so I started to research.Turns out that almost all of the phosphate binders prescribed today are, in fact, chemicals that can be purchased over the counter. I encourange you do do your own research, but this is what I found:1) Calcium Carbonate is the stuff TUMS is made of. It is pure limestone, and available in powder with no colors, flavors, or additives for as little as $5 a pound; a single TUMS extra-strength contains 1 gram of this substance.2) Calcium Acetate is the stuff Phoslo is made of. It is also available for about $10 for a month's supply. A single pill is 667mg and usual prescription is three pills at each meal;3) Magnesium Carbonate is another binder available over the counter in its chemical form. 475mg/day is what I found to be the maximum dose, and you have to watch for high magnesium in your blood. The studies I read suggest that slightly high magnesium of 3.2 is good for you, but you need to be careful not to get out of hand. A month's supply of this chemical is also around $10;4) Nicotinic Acid (Vitamin B3 or Niacin) has been shown to reduce Ph levels and add other potentially beneficials like LDL cholesterol and cardio benefits at doses between 1 and 2 grams/day. This vitamin is available in bulk powder form for about $8 a month. It is also great in that it needs to be taken 1/2 times a day, and will block Ph for hours after taken - so it protects you during snacks or if you forgot another binder. Also available for about $10 a month; 1 gram a day will cause flushing and possibly itching until your body tolerates - a good idea to work up to your final dose slowly and (if possible) take an 80 mg aspirin 1 hour before your vitamin. 5) Ferric Citrate - an iron-based binder also available for a few dollars a month as a chemical instead of hundreds as a prescription. Usual starting dose is 1 gram 3x a day with meals. Potential benefits include stabilized hemoglobin, reduced need for IV iron and EPO. Side effects include black poop and stomach upset. Two other OTC chemicals also prescribed for Ph binding include Aluminum Hydroxide and Lanthanam Carbonate. I won't discuss those here but include them for you to conduct your own research into if your situation warrants.In my situation, I did a food diary for a week and calculated that I would need 17 Phoslo a day to bind my Ph intake. Obviously, that wouldn't work (and it wasn't), and I couldn't turn to TUMS to make up the difference, because it also contained calcium. My insurance wouldn't pay for more than one binder, so I did my research.Working with my doctor, I now have a 5-chemical Ph binding regimen that I compound myself. For me:1) 450mg Magnesium Carbonate2) 1000mg Calcium Acetate3) 1200mg Calcium Carbonate4) 1000mg Nicotinic Acid5) 2500mg Ferric Citrateis compounded and taken as 1 dose of niacin in the morning and equal doses of the rest at meals each day. I get all the benefits of combination therapy, my Ph levels are within range for the first time ever, and I do it all for just a few dollars a month.Of course, this is not for everybody. I take extreme interest in my disease, have educated myself on these therapies, and have acquired the knowledge, materials, and equipment necessary to supplement myself. I make doses daily to ensure correct weights, and only make changes based on discussions with my doctor. Luckily, my doctor has the confidence in me to discuss how these supplements might be beneficial. If you have perpetual problems keeping your Ph low, or if you cannot afford the prices of prescription binders - AND if you take the time to educate yourself and buy/use the proper equipment, there are affordable options out there for you. I certainly don't recommend everyone start supplementing themselves without medical consult, but for those that will take the time to learn and understand, there are potential solutions out there to help you keep your phosphorous levels low and extend both quality and length of life.ALWAYS talk to your doctor. Even if he/she disagrees, NEVER supplement yourself without informing them of exactly what you are doing! This isn't easy or fun, but it's a potential pathway to life for those (like me) who have issues with binders. "

"Renal Failure","Foamy Urine - Should I Worry? ","Hey guys first time posting here. I'm a 23 year old male, In good health. With the exception of a spontaneous pneumothorax 2 months ago I have never had any major health issues, and everything has always been normal. For the past 6 months (this could of happened before as well I just never payed attention) I've been experiencing foamy urine on and off, mainly when I don't drink enough water. I've had urinalysis done twice in the past 3 months once by my GP at a routine physical, where he said everything was normal and again when I was in the hospital, everything was normal there as well. When I originally went for my pneumothorax I thought I may of had a kidney infection but when tested everything came back normal. The darker my urine the more foam I notice (particularly in the morning) and the more water I drink the less I see bubbles. If I stay hydrated with 7-10 glasses of water I never see it. do you guys think it's related to dehydration or to an underlying kidney issue? I've also had CT scans done in the past year (about 4 abdominal, 1 chest) and they said everything looks perfectly fine. I also should note I was in the hospital about 5 months ago for dehydration as well. Thanks for the help everyone!! "

"Renal Failure","CKD and pregnancy??","Hi All,I am a 30 year old female and was diagnosed with CKD 5 years ago. I have been very stable due to a combination of diet and ramipiril (for proteinuria). Creatinin is about 220 and blood pressure is perfect. I am otherwise healthy and I am a healthy weight. My neprologist has always been unsure as to whether I should get pregnant and my feeling is that she is opposed to it. I went to an obstetrician who said I should try and get pregnant now. Since speaking to the obstetrician I came off the Ramipiril to see how my kidneys would function on their own. It turns out that the protein levels in my urine rose quite high (they were approx. 1 on Ramipiril and are now approx. 4). Since then my nephrologist has said that she couldn't recommend that I try to get pregnant. I am devastated and I feel like there is very little information out there for me to make an informed choice. My doctor doen't seem to have any other female patients in my predicament. My chice at this stage is stay off the Ramipiril and requrie a transplant within the next 18 months or go back on it and not require a transplant for an unknown duration. This second prospect is obviously the safer choice longterm but the unknown is so frustrating and I wish to be a mother above anything else. I was just wondering whether anyone else has been/ is in a similar position?Thank you!"

"Renal Failure","Having just a solitary kidney causing CKD?","I have searched the web and am amazed how many sites there are that talk about CKD, kidney issues, but I do not find any that include much information about CKD due to having just one kidney.

"Renal Failure","Frustration people's unhealthy habits","Hi all, I'm 34 years old and have been on dialysis for a year now and have been entered in the transplant list. I was diagnosed with IGA Nephropathy 6 years ago and was told the disease SOMETIMES progressed to ESRD and when it did it would be something like 20 years before that happened. Unfortunately for me, my disease progressed in 5 years, and the multiple doctors I've seen have told me the progression or getting the disease was because of a fault of my own. It just happened, there wasn't anything I did or didn't do that caused it. Which is incredibly frustrating. I've always eaten healthy, I used to exercise regularly and always took care of myself and my body so this feels like a huge blow.My parents have always been healthy people, they take care of themselves and get their routine medical checkups done, they eat healthily and exercise. They both live very healthy lifestyles, they really set up a great example for me and I'm so grateful for that. My in-laws, on the other hand, are some of the most unhealthy people. They never workout and they constantly eat junk. They are both obese. When I was diagnosed with CKD I tried to get them to make a lifestyle change because they were already showing signs of heart issues. My father in law has high cholesterol and his doctor advised him to cut out red meat, fried foods, etc. And my mother in law takes baby aspiring for some heart issue. I really wish they could understand that the issues they are having are manageable and fixable before they become more major problems (like heart attack, stroke, diabetes, etc). They've never listened. Now that I am on dialysis and my life has completely changed where I have so many food restrictions, traveling is harder, I'm EXHAUSTED all the time, and I rely on a machine to keep me alive, I'm becoming very angry and resentful toward them. My father in law sent me a picture yesterday of a pizza joint that was holding a pizza eating contest (as in eat these many pizzas in x amount of time and win a prize), and he texted ""I had to!"" My immediate reaction was to get p****d at him. I responded to his text saying in so many words that I was on dialysis and attached to a machine that is keeping me alive while he's eating whole pizzas??? Like, get a clue. You're wasting what could be a perfectly healthy body while there are people like me who would give anything to have healthy kidneys or a healthy heart or whatever. And while I understand he can do whatever he wants with his life, the lack of sensitivity around the fact that I don't have any control over my body is so depressing. In my view, if you have health problems that are caused by your own actions, against the advice of your doctors it's kind of like ok well what did you expect and when I look at my situation it just seems so unfair. Like I honestly have always been so aware of my health and eating right and exercising, yet I was the one to get this horrible disease. Just seems so unfair. I think the fact that I really do love them and care about them is why I'm so frustrated with them. I wouldn't wish dialysis or kidney failure on anyone, so why won't they take care of themselves? They have the change to live healthy lives but I feel like they are wasting that chance. How is it possible for people that are close to me to not see how hurtful that is. I don't want to feel this way but I'm starting to feel resentful toward them (and honestly anyone that just doesn't care). I love them both and they are both very nice people but the cluelessness and lack of perspective is bothering me.Full disclosure, I do go to therapy and have talked about this with my therapist. I just thought maybe some people out there who are dealing similar emotions had any advice on how you've managed them. Therapy helps quite a bit, but I'd love to hear from people who've actually experience the same feeling or are dealing with dialysis at a young age."

"Renal Failure","Understanding and answers to low eGFR","Hi all,I'm 31, relatively healthy, correct weight etc and about 8 months ago I had routine bloods taken at my GP. All were fine except an alarming eGFR of 65. A urine test identified no trace of protein thoughMy GP had the tests repeated the following week and eGFR had risen slightly to 67. Again, a urine test identified no protein in my urine. He gave me the option of going back for more tests in 3 months or being referred to a Nephrologist. I opted to go and see Nephrologist in hospital.On my first visit to the Nephrologist my eGFR had risen to 69. The urine test again showed no protein in my urine. A subsequent 24hr urine collection also came back normal. I was told I would likely be discharged at my next appt 3 months later.At my next visit my eGFR had risen to 78 now. All other blood readings within normal ranges and again no protein in my urine. I was told I would be discharged at my next appt.Last week I had my latest appt and my eGFR had risen to 79. Again no protein in my urine however I have been kept on to see the Nephrologist again in another 6 months. I asked her what was going on and she sad she didn't know but was told to drink 2 litres of water per day which I do anyway as I don't drink tea or coffee. I'm led to believe that a low eGFR would be reflected by a corresponding urine test but this doesn't seem to be happening in my case.Just want to add that my BP is always around 125 to 135 systolic and under 80 diastolic. I also should advise that I have had a an ultrasound and kidneys look to be functioning fine, are correct size and I have 2. Only small complication was bladder wasn't totally emptying but was described as only a bit of retention. I also have a varicule/epididimal cyst.Does anybody have any idea what is going on please? I've got another 6 months of worry and think my Nephroligist still won't know what is going on.Thanks in advance."

Potassium and Sodium are in accepted range but Serum urea and Creatinine are affecting my eGFR. I see a Kidney nurse every 6 months but have not seen either a nephrologist or Renal dietitian. i have regular cystoscopies due to the UTIs and the fact that I had bladder cancer in 2007 which was cleared up without problems. It was the urologist who referred me for a CT scan which i had today without any contrast dye because the radiologist told me the dye could damage the kidney.My BP is quite high 165/89. I have a pacemaker and an artificial mitral valve.I have been told that BP affects the kidney but as i already take losartan 100mg, Bisoprolol 5mg and Furusemide 40mg. I also take warfarin. i do not think they can give me any more meds to control it.I have changed my diet and am no longer eating meat, trying to drink about 6 pints of water a day and I try to walk 30 minutes a day.I wouldlike to improve my kidney function if that is possible, but that is not going to happen with my creatinine so high!Is there anything else i can do to improve things? i would appreciate any suggestions."
"Renal Failure","eGFR Calculator differences","Hi. For those that do not know me I am 68, single kidney (other removed due to cancer last July 31st). Since removal my eGFR started at 35, went as high as 43, but last was 38 (after fasting 12 hours). There is a eGFR calculator I found on the web from the national kidney foundation. I found a very interesting difference. Perhaps this is well known but it was news to me. I used a creatinine level of 1.8 (it is not unusual for this to be he ""normal"" creatinine level for a person with a solitary kidney). If I entered the 1.8, my age and calculated, the eGFR came out to be 38. This is consistent with what my last blood test found. HOWEVER. There is an option to enter your own height and weight rather than just letting the calculator use the average for a man my age (which is how it is done by the labs, using an average, not my actual). This time my eGFR came out to 44. Now both figures put me in the stage 3b category. But it is a good example of how just using ""normal"" or ""averages"" to compare ourselves to can sometimes be misleading.Hi.

Dr didn’t seem to concerned , just wanted me to get it rechecked within a month.I will be the first to say, I don’t drink enough water, eat a lot of protein and I do kickboxing and Muay Thai 4-5 days a week which is pretty intense .However I suffer from bad health anxiety and always think the worse. I started thinking I was in kidney failure right away and now I’m just very scared because I know nothing about any of this."

"Renal Failure","muscle cramps, Bun 26, bun/cre ratio 24, creatinine normal 1.1","Hello all - I really need your help. I have been having severe muscle cramps in all muscles after moderate or light use. I have been getting very severe cramps after walking a few blocks when I normally can walk miles and miles. I get cramps in jaw after chewing a steak. I get cramps in my arms after taking out garbage. Cramps in my hand after normal activity (thumb and index finger pulling together and locking). Went to doctor and had full work-up at NYU. They had few answers. A few things were a little abnormal. My BUN was 26, my BUN/Creatinine ration was 24. My creatinine was normal at 1.1. My vit D was low at 17. My RDW was slightly high at 17.1 (prev was 19.4). Doctor says this cannot be causing severe symptoms I am having. It is so bad I cannot lie down after walking, the cramps are so bad, I get up and walk around for a few minutes and they get a little better. I am not dehydrated at all. I take all necessary supplements and blood work shows it. Cramps are worse in legs because they get the most use but it happens in every muscle. Even when I am cleaning myself in shower, if I turn to left or right, pain in the ""lats"" of the side I turn. Please help if you can. I would really appreciate it.

"Renal Failure","Sudden increase in Creatinine and decrease in eGfr","Hi. I am a 34 year old male and earlier this week when I went for blood tests for kidney and liver function, I came to know that some results were out of the normal range:Creatinine - 112.35EGfr - 73AST - 42.7ALT - 46.2I had full tests done just three months back and results were all normal as shown below:Creatinine - 89EGfr - 123AST - 21ALT - 19I am very concerned as kidney diseases run in the family and I have lost a cousin to kidney failure. I have never had high blood pressure am not diabetic. The results were never in this range before and the only things I can think of this that could have dealt the blows are alcohol during the festive season (and I was stupid enough to do binge drinking about three weeks back) and taking prescribed anti depressant medicines about two weeks back. This has me extremely worried and am having panic attacks. Doctor has asked to take fish oil and see him back after 1 month but I feel I can’t wait that long. I might go see him sooner to share earlier results which was from another clinic. Should I be worried and is there any permanent damage. Any feedback would be helpful. Thanks "

"Renal Failure","Feeling low, frustrated and emotional","I am sorry to have a moan I just feel crap, I found out I had ckd almost 8yrs ago i was 28% then and stayed that was for over 5 years then dropped to 21% and within 8 months from that I was at 12%, then 10% 3 months after that but stayed at 10% for a year (which is so frustrating because you dont get dialysis at 10% you just struggle everyday... I am now at 9%, I dont know my creatinine or urea because my last 2 lots of blood results havent gone on my patient view which I am not sure why but thats annoying, I know my creatinine is about 600. I just feel awful and fed up of being like this!! I was told if I went down below 10% in april my dr would put my tube in ready for dialysis which weirdly made me happy because I am sorry ready for dialysis, I am praying it will help and make me feel awake and just feel a bit more myself again not feeling like a 90yr old ill person... im 30yrs old and have just had enough!! I go to get my bloods done monthly (I havent been told how often to go have my bloods done) and my pd team make me feel like I am some hypochondriac who should only have my bloods done before clinic which is every 3 months, I am not getting any help. I dont complain ever! even on my worst day I never moan or complain, I only go to the hospital once a month to have bloods done, My dietitian and Neph are so so nice and caring but I seen them once every 3 months.

"Renal Failure","Water and Fasting Effect on Blood Test eGFR","Had an interesting experience this past week regarding my blood work. For those who do not know I am 68, had one kidney removed on July 31st. Male. Immediately after operation my egfr was 35 for a while. then went to 38, 39 range. Then this past Friday I had blood work done by my kidney doctor. She had me drinking 70 ounces or more of water every day for a month before this test. Well my egfr from the blood test increased to 43, my all time high since the operation. Then the following Tuesday my primary care doctor wanted to check my Cholesterol level and for this blood test I fasted for about 13 hours. Well my egfr went back to 38. On the non fasting blood work my Creatinine was 1.62. On the fasting blood work, just 3-4 days later it was 1.8. Such an effect simply from water consumption. Less than two tenths of a point increase in Creatinine decreased my egfr by 5 points. Both of these doctors are NOT fans of the egfr methodology as it does not take into account the uniqueness of height and weight, nor the reason you are CKD (is it because you only have one kidney, or is it really kidney failure, do you have diabetes or other influencing factors), but it is the only test currently available and ""normally"" used.Had an interesting experience this past week regarding my blood work.

"Renal Failure","Newly Diagnosed - Terminology & Sleep Problems","So I've recently learned that I'm not invincible or immortal.I'm 48, from the UK. Long time hypertensive and T2 diabetic, neither well controlled because it didn't need to be because I was immortal right? Tablets for BP & T2. I don't smoke or drink. Well, occasional shandy, I'm always the driver, it's just never interested me.Recently attended A&E after suffering a dizzy spell. Got checked over and had full bloods taken and checked.Advised that I was being admitted overnight as my kidney function was troublesome. A previous blood test in November 2016 had shown some concern but after hearing nothing after a retest I assumed, wrongly, that all was well. I missed 2017 diabetic review....So I'm on a steep learning curve. It turns out I was anaemic, which would explain a lot of the lethargy and constant feeling cold I'd been suffering in recent months.But it also turned out that the anaemia was cause by Chronic Kidney Disease or Acute Kidney Injury.The A&E consultant seemed concerned it was a rapid decline in function since my 2016 test results but had nothing from 2017 to measure it against. He mentioned Ibuprofen but I hadn't taken but 2 x 200mg in the last 6 months.I'm confused about the different readings that I've been reading about. Basically, during a 5 night stay in hospital trying to regulate my blood glucose and blood pressure, I was released. BP was still quite high, about 150/90+ ish but sugars were under control.I don't know what my GFR reading was or indeed what it even IS! My creatanine levels were steady at about 350, whereas in Nov 2016 they were in the 160-180 range, slightly above what was considered normal.I was seen by a Nephrologist on the ward and asked him some blunt questions. One ward doctor had told me that with creatanine levels at 350 my kidneys were functioning at about 40%. The Nephologist poopooed that and said my function was about 16% and they'd start dialysis at 8%!!!!!I was very taken aback.I was eventually released but since I've been released I have been absolutely EXHAUSTED. I've never been the most fit guy in the world but I was able to function well and keep up with general daily living activities without struggling. Now, a 100 yard walk to my work place from the car park has to be done at a steady pace.I am also suffering terribly from sleep problems.I'm not sure if this is related but since October 2017 I've had problems whereby I've had a lot of throat mucus, sinus popping and bubbling which in turn has been effectively choking my airways at night preventing me from sleeping. I was pretty much OK until my hospital visit and ironically I slept well in hospital.In Oct 2017 I noticed a shortness of breath on holiday one day accompanied with a ""raspy"" feeling on my outward breath, as if mucus was blocked. It comes and goes but a few weeks ago I had a horrendous 2-3 weeks of hacking up thick yellow mucus, unable to sleep, constant throat clearing, nose mucus etc. Of course, I didn't want to bother the doctor with all this and bravely battled on.So, like one other person who's story I've read on here, I'm pretty terrified that this is it for me. Steady decline, dialysis, and hope I can find someone that likes me enough to offer up a spare kidney.I had a drip with iron supplement just before I left hospital and a blood test about a week ago which showed that my iron levels were back to normal but the ""haemoglobins"" were still low and apparently these are important for energy levels as they carry oxygen around your body?I guess I'm just looking for some reassurance from people who have been down this path and have managed to prevent any further kidney damage by good BP & T2D control which is what the Nephrologist suspects my damage has been caused by.I'm seeing him for a check up later this month and hoping against hope that it's still some acute damage that's caused my problems and it's somewhat reversible but deep down I'm sure it's as they suspect, chronic kidney disease cause by a combination of poorly controlled BP, T2D and various medications over the years.I need to feel well again for my family. My children have already lost their Mother to cancer so the worry is compounded for me Thanks in advance for any info/encouragement anyone can offer.M."

"Renal Failure","Surprising facts I read on CKD","In my area, which is not a large town in upstate New York, I was surprised to learn we have multiple Kidney Centers which provide dialysis, advice, minor treatments. They are all associated with one company. some of the centers are only 5 miles apart. For a small area I was surprised at this and contacted one of them on any information they have about CKD. The directed me to their website where I read some statistics that surprised me.​--15% of population suffers from some stage of CKD--66% of those, the CKD was caused by high blood pressure or diabetes.--in the United States there are 468,000 people on some form of dialysis​--in the United States 100,000 people are on the list waiting for a transplant​--in the United States 17,000 people per year receive a transplant​While these numbers change nothing about our own personal conditions it showed me that we are not so alone. When dealing with out disease I think we sometimes feel that it has somehow singled us out and made us one of just a relative few who suffer the same. We are not so abnormal. Also to find so many centers dedicated to just kidney care and research is always a hopeful thing. Perhaps not for someone of my age (68) but hopefully not so far off. It also highlights one sad thing in my opinion. Only 17,000 transplants per year. Out of a population of over 350 million people, 17,000 is such a low number. 468,000 have the disease but only 17,000 get a transplant. More awareness of vital organ donation is needed. Of course CKD affects mostly people over 60, so perhaps a donation is not feasible and younger people are given a higher priority on the transplant waiting list. But still.​"

Anyway, this study was done on 1660 males between the ages of 18-90 years of age. 2072 females between the ages of 18-90 years of age. Included 869 males and females over the age of 65. Women Age. Median gfr. range 35-39. 79. 66-9240-44. 77. 65-8950-54. 73. 60-8660-64. 68. 56-8065-69. 66. 56-7670-74. 66. 55-7775-79. 62. 51-7380-84. 64. 50-78Over 85. 59. 45-73I just picked some ages but on the site they do cover all of them. Dang I wish I could share that site, the article is AWESOME!As some of you my know, I also have arthritis and Lupus and I am going through a real tough time, hurts pretty bad to type, I know there are many mistakes and I'm sorry. I'm also sorry that I have to give myself a break and come back to give you the numbers for the males. I really am sorry guys."

"Renal Failure","Can extreme emotional stress cause proteinuria?","I just received results on a large panel of tests my nephrologist ordered to address my concerns with a significant drop in e-GFR (from 100 to the 70's and 80's) over the past two years.During the first visit, his office found some borderline proteinuria (30 mg on random urine sampl with dipstick). He ordered further tests including 24h urine, creatinine clearance, renal panel, etc.All tests came back fine except the 24h urine which again showed proteinuria - this time 183mg/ 24 h, with normal being considered 150 mg or below.I have been through 2-3 months of extreme emotional stress (related to a major career deadline plus serious health anxiety related to some acid reflux issues). I wonder whether the proteinuria may have been caused either by this prolonged and extreme anxiety (I also had severe panic attacks) or by one month of PPI-s for acid reflux - or both.Up until now, nobody ever told me I had protein in urine even though I had several tests at doctor's offices this past year which I assume were fine, or else they would have reported problems to me.I read extreme emotional stress can cause proteinuria but my nephrologist doesn't seem to be too convinced. He said the proteinuria is likely not related to PPI-s or the recent stress - even though stress seems to be considered a common cause. I also asked a dr. online and he said the stress I have been through is the most probable cause.All other tests were good, e-GFR was 82, creatinine 0.87, clearance all within normal ranges, etc. No diabetes or pre-diabetes, no high blood pressure.I don't know what to believe anymore and am so scared that this may be early stage kidney disease.I won't see the nephrologist for follow up until next week and I am dying with anxiety until then - though he already expressed his opinion.He just tells me not to worry about it because this level of proteinuria is low and nothing to worry about.Considering it may indicate early stages of a progressive disease, how can I not worry about it?What do you know about stress and proteinuria? I want to believe my dr. is wrong because this would mean I have a chance to reverse this.Thank you so much.I was hoping he would say stress was the culprit"

"Renal Failure","Dehydration - Creatinine","My last blood work indicated dehydration. I was surprised as I thought I drank properly. However my Creatinine was up as were other indicators of dehydration. My Kidney doc has me do the following. For one 24 hour period. Get up. urinate but do not capture it. From that point on until the next morning, at which time I should capture the morning urination, capture all urine. Measure it in ounces or ml. During the same period record how much fluid I consume. Also not the color of the urine. Anything darker than light yellow is dehydration. The darker, the more dehydrated. The results surprised me how dehydrated I was, after consuming what I thought was proper fluids. My output was barely 800 ml. The color was quite yellow. Then...​The next day to repeat the test but this time drink at least 64 ounces of fluid, preferably 80 or more. The difference was amazing. In the morning it started same yellow. By noon it became almost clear. The output for the day was over 2000. I also was considerably less fatigued than usual. The doctor directed me to continue this amount of consumption . This will lower my creatinine level in addition to removing other toxins as well as cardiovascular health. Also aids in reducing glucose levels. I am looking forward to my next test in mid April to see if all this is true.​One very slight negative. It did add about 1.5 pounds to my body weight. I am not retaining fluids. No swelling. It is just that much more liquids in my body. "
"Renal Failure","Selecting a Dialysis Center","As I've mentioned in earlier posts, I have recently changed nephrologist. My new nephrologist is in an urban area about 45 miles away. I'm planning to move to this same urban location this summer so I can more easily access medical care as I age. (I live alone and am the last person living in my family so I've decided I need to be sure I've got easy access for all my medical care.)There are numerous dialysis centers in this urban area. One is affiliated with the university hospital with which my new nephrologist is also affiliated. However, several other centers have higher QIP ratings than the university-affiliated center. (Of course, that may be due to the severity of complications many patients who go to the university nephrology program present.) in addition, the university center is 30-45 minutes away from the area where I will live.So there are several other centers much closer to my future home. They all have higher QIP ratings.My questions:1. Do we choose our dialysis centers or do our nephrologist choose them for (or with) us?2. If we choose our dialysis centers, what would you suggest I think about when selecting a dialysis center?Thank you,Marj"

"Renal Failure","With one kidney what to expect for ""normal"" test results.","I am 68 year old male who had kidney removed in July due to cancerous tumor. Stage 1 and grade 1 encapsulated tumor. I see a Urologist, Kidney doctor, primary care doctor and an oncologist. While currently there is no indication of cancer left, the oncologist is used as a second opinion to what the Urologist and kidney doctor tell me. Today's appointment was the first time a medical professional told me what to expect blood and Urine tests to be for a person with one kidney. She stressed that while it is possible to have all ""normal"" numbers with one kidney, that it is not likely. She said I should expect Creatinine numbers to be in the 1.7 to 1.9 range as my new normal. This of course means low eGFR numbers which would classify me as stage 3. However to totally ignore the prognosis and studies about stage 3 CKD because these are not specific to a person with just one kidney. All these are based upon people with two kidneys that are failing and rarely take into consideration the one kidney patient. She also said the Universities and physicians are taking a hard look at the usefulness of eGFR. That it is not a specific test since it just takes your Creatinine levels and applies it to a one time study of patients years ago. And that the group it is based upon was not a good cross section. That eGFR does NOT take into account if the kidney is damaged or capable of full function. That here again it does not consider if 2 kidneys, or 1 kidney, or 1 perfectly normal kidney with 1 failing kidney. It does not consider that all 68 year old males are not of the same stature nor the same weight. eGFR is too general a classification. She pointed me to this study http://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/19/5/844.full? which explains the faults of eGFR and how we look at stages of CKD. For example for a person of 70 with stage 3 CKD, only a small percentage will progress to full blown kidney failure. While it his much more likely in a younger person. It is a great article. It starts a little confusing but as you read the point is clear. That eGFR alone should not bused to put you into a stage. It recommends eliminating stage 1 and 2. It sites that the worst part of the current staging system is it puts people into a classification and causes them extreme worry, when in actuality they have little to be worried about.

Last September, she was hospitalised with an Acute Kidhey Injury and wasn't expected to survive. Remarkably, though, she turned the corner and was discharged with a kidney function of 7%.Since then, I've been her principal carer. She's been relatively okay in that time. By Christmas, her function had improved to 9%. By February, though, it was down to 6%,Her most recent blood test, two weeks ago, has now put it at 4%. Her breathlessness has increased over the last month, to the point where she can hardly walk a few yards (with her zimmer) before being severely breathless. In the last week, things have deteriorated further, with the usual attendant symptoms (chronic itching, etc) - but her appetite has remained good.That is until yesterday. She hardly ate a thing, and didn't want to. She's been getting bad nausea, so is taking buccal Prochlorperazine to help. I didn't really expect her to make it through last night.She did, though. This morning, she at half a bowl of porridge - but that's been it. She's been sleeping heavily in chair since then. When awake, she's been increasingly vague and incoherent - like she's slightly drunk. She feels very weak.

"Renal Failure","urination patterns / poor sleep","I'm male, 34. Not sure if you might remember me from my previous postings/threads in which I was having some issues with urination.I'm still having these and and off strange urinary patterns with disturbed sleeping patterns too where I'd wake up at like 1am and then sometimes at 5am nearly every night now. I've had urianalysis samples done 4 times, all normal, tested my blood glucose level several times using home testing kits before/after meals and that's normal too. Then last week I had a DRE and the doctor said my prostate was slightly enlarged however it was very smooth and normal in that regard. He wasn't overly concerned about it and said it's not abnormal and this can happen. Anyway I got a PSA test done and waiting for the results from that. He thinks that my symptoms are more likely due to a slight over-active bladder than anything else and more concerned with my anxiety levels. This is what I'm concerned about though - my urination patterns which seem odd. I have been keeping a diary of the patterns. Yesterday for example I drank around 3.5l but then voided a total of almost 4.5 litres! But then today I've voided around 900ml and drunk around 2l. Most other days it's been an average of around 1.6 - 2.5 litres which is fairly normal. However on occasions I'll sometimes have an urge to pee twice in 2 hours DESPITE NOT HAVING DRUNK in between. In other words, say I drank 1.5l, about an hour later, I'll get the urge to go and void 700ml and then another hour later I'll get another urge and void the same amount. Why is this? My bladder filled up despite not having drink anything in between. I wonder if this is simply the extra urine that was waiting to be emptied from my kidneys into my bladder or what? My flow rate is fine and again no straining, burning, no pain etc.That's why I'm confused as to whether it's my prostate or something else.Another big thing is that I occasionally feel a little off after I peed, like “on edge” almost rather anxious and not quite myself. Can’t quite describe it. Then other times where I feel totally normal. Comes and goes. This is the same kind of sensation I've felt waking up in the middle of night."

"Renal Failure","25 year old severe urological problems since birth. Current Stage 4 CKD.","Hello. I am 25 years old and have suffered with Urological problems since birth. Long story short, it’s affected my entire life. I am severely prone to getting Urinary Tract Infections and/or pyelonephritis (kidney infections), which always result in me being admitted to hospital as I have become resistant to many anti-biotics after being treated for these problems so many times in the past. Things were apparantly very rough when I was a child (having septicaemia and being near fatal a couple of times) but to be honest I don’t remember much of that, I think I’ve managed to block it from my memory as a coping mechanism. What I do remember as a child was being bullied in school, as part of my condition I was unable to control my bladder, leading to wetting myself most days and with kids being kids, I got picked on for that. Things settled down for me in High School thankfully, I had less infections and incidents of incontinence. However in July 2014 everything flared up again, I got a kidney infection which progressed onto me having septicaemia and pneumonia also. I was put on high dependency (not quite intensive care) and since then my life has been very difficult. I lost my dream career (I had managed to become a Police Officer) because of my health issues and it has all affected my relationship with both family and girlfriends as I have struggled to cope. My kidney function began to get worse and worse, and I had my left kidney removed in July 2015. It was then deemed that to prevent any further damage to my remaining kidney, I needed major bladder reconstruction to manage the bladder pressures and stop reflux up to the kidney. I had this done in april 2017, and as a result I have to self catheterise to go to the toilet, as I am unable to empty my bladder on my own (was expected and agreed to when I had the surgery, as the reconstruction stops the bladder muscles co-ordinating properly.). Between the kidney removal and bladder reconstruction I continued to have frequent UTIs / kidney infections and my remaining kidney took further damage. Since my bladder reconstruction I had a bit of time without any problems and everything was stable, however in the past month I had surgery for a kidney stone (first time I’ve ever had one) and then had an infection as a result of the operation (as I said earlier, very susceptible to infections when things are ‘played around’ with.). My egfr is currently 20, it was 19 last week (the lowest it’s ever been) and my creatinine is currently 270. My urologist and nephrologist hope that these will improve slightly after having the kidney stone removed, however it is only hope. I see my specialists every couple of months to monitor my condition and in the long run, the plan is dialysis and/or a transplant, but no one seems to know how long that could be, as I can have periods of stability but just one infection or another kidney stone could bring my kidney function down enough to get to that point. I’ve never posted on anything like this before, but I am just feeling extremely down about it all at the moment and feel like it is all relentless. I’m not sure posting this will help me in anyway, but it’s worth a try I guess. If anyone has any advice, or has been / is going through something similar, then it would be nice to hear from you and to know I’m not the only one suffering. I also may be able to share advice from my own experiences. Thankyou for reading 😊"

"Renal Failure","Confused about BUN - diuretic - drinking lots of water","July 31 I had my left kidney removed. I am 68 year old white male. Previously my Bun levels were high but in normal range.

All my other blood work (potassium, glucose, protein) are in normal range. My GFR is 45 which they say is to be expected for one kidney. I see a urologist and a kidney doctor. My confusion is this. My primary care tried a diuretic to lower BP. This raised BUN to 38 so we stopped it. So the forcing of ""water"" from my system increased the BUN. But my urologist and kidney doctor want me to drink lots of water. This makes me urinate more, therefore isn't this having the same effect as the diuretic, forcing more ""water"" through the kidney?

"Renal Failure","Foamy urine - proteinuria or lack of water intake?","For over 3 years I noticed foamy urine off and on. The first time I noticed I went to doc, did a urine sample test and found small traces of urine by nurse. So I was then sent off to have lots of kindey test:eGFRMICROALBUMIN/CREATININEMICROALBUMIN, UR, QNBUNBUN-to-creatinine ratioA1CLiver PanelThyroid PanelANA PanelCBCThis was 3 years ago. And recently had the same test done besides ANA, and all were normal again, even dipstick was normal. He said dipsticks do show false positives. The new MICROALBUMIN/CREATININE and MICROALBUMIN, UR, QN was done on 5/22/13 and again was normal. I even made appoinment with kidney doc and it seemed like he laughed me out of office when I showed him my results. He told me not to ever worry about it. Still I want to know why I still keep getting foamy urine when I dont drink water. And all were normal. But I still notice lots of bubbles, sometimes it takes less than 2 minutes to go away. It looks foamy. I workout but only drink protein shakes 1-3 a week at most. I'm 31, good What I noticed:1. When I drink loads of water, I rarely see any bubbles and do not see any foamy appearance2. I mainly see foamy appearance in morning3. When I sit to pee, I see minimal if any bubbles or foamy appearance4. If I hit the side of toilet I do not see anythingFrom what I taken, foamy urine is an early sign of kidney damage, proteinuria. However on many forums, many of the responsies to these questions are ""GO SEE A DOC, IT'S PROTEIN LEAKING"" but all responises are from non medical professionals.This is what I read so far:""Far and away, foamy urine is not associated with any abnormality of the kidneys. There are some (I am one of them) who think that the foaming is related to a high velocity of concentrated urine flow and therefore is more of a curiosity than a threat to your health."" -Newell R.

"Renal Failure","I need help","Hello there, I am a 30 year old woman, I have an autoimmune disease (Hashimoto). I am brand new to this. I never had any issues with my kidneys until now. Recently, I started getting lots of bacterial vaginotis, my doctor took some urine samples and started to notice that every time I have a urine sample there is a blood in it. He did some more digging and he found out I had blood in my urine since 2010. I have a high RBC in my urine, no leukocytes, no infection , no protein. My GFR is over 120 and BUN and creatine ratio is normal as well. My ultrasound and ct scan came back normal, I have a small lession on my right kidney about 6.5 mm..I have a bad flank pain that comes and goes and moves around a lot. My doctor wants to do a kidney biopsy. What would cause flank pain and blood in my urine? I honestly do not think I have a kidney disease. What do you guys think? Thank you"

"Renal Failure","Husband is 35 and might have kidney problems","Hello all. My husband is 35 years old. He's been a smoker in his early teens but he's been on and off for the last 5 years. Early this year around June we discovered that there was protein in his urine for a insurance check up. We didnt take it serious since he's pretty much healthy. We took it again and same thing. We went to check in the clinic and indeed there's protein and even occult blood too. We then was referred to a kidney specialist. We did the ultrasound, the blood and urine tests again. And even a 24 hr urine test. Protien came back high in the 24hr over 1k. Theres still a small trace of blood. Other than that nothing they can find. Now they was us to do a biopsy which my husband is highly against. Bc ultrasound came back fine, kidney size is fine. Blood and urine test all came back normal except high protiens and small trace of blood. But husband dont want to poke anything if nothing is wrong. The test results from the specialists came back with a creatinine level of 1.13 but earlier when we did in the clinic (a month before) it was only .91. I'm scare as to why it jumping so high in such short amount of time. His egrf listed on the result is only 84 which I feel is quite low for his age. He should be up in the 100s. Isnt it?We bought some dip test and we noticed that after he did the blood and urine test in the specialists office, the blood no longer shows up on the dip test. Idk if its bc he had stopped smoking thats why or what. But no more sign of bloos but the specialists just brushed off like its comes and goes. My husband dont have hypertension or diabetes. Everything they tests for came back negative such as lupus etc. But now they are pushing tbe biopsy bc he has a half sister who passed away because of kidney failure at 30 as well. She really didnt fight she lost her husband 3 years before that. She basically just gave up. But her was noticed through her first pregnancies they warned her theres protiens in her urine she should come back and look at it. But she never went back. Lasted for almost 8 yrs before she had kidney failures. The speacilist thinks its either genetic or igfa something like that. My husband we are a young fam. We have 3 young kids and one on the way. I cant imagine life without him. What should we do? Need some opinions?"

"Renal Failure","Liquid retention? Kidney Failure symptom ?","I'm an 18 year old male, about a month or so ago I urinated blood, that same day I went to the doctor after calling because of it.

The blood in the urine cleared up that same day, before I even started taking the antibiotics. I had no symptoms that I was aware of and only found out about the UTI because of the blood in the urine, so I could have had the UTI for some time. Aside from the antibiotics, I got a renal/kidney ultrasound, which was done last Wednesday. Today I found about the results, apparently I have some fluid retention so they're referring me to a specialist, which I've yet to see.

Panic has set in, mainly because I had a gynae cancer 6 years ago. Mind in overdrive- recurrence. Just wonder what could cause a low GFR result?

"Renal Failure","Just been diagnosed","Hi, just found this site. I have recently been diagnosed with CKD, its all been a bit of a shock. I'm 50 and work full time.

This came as a huge surprise, as apart from the headaches I feel OK. I've been told I will need to start dialysis, but they will hold off until I develop more symptoms or drop to 5% (so not sure when that will be) Looking at other posts this seems really low to start? I've just had my first appointment to discuss the different dialysis options, so need to make a decision soon - but lots of into to take in. I'm booked in for a scan to map my veins if I need a fistula. Also discussed going on the transplant list (my wife has offered to see if she would be suitable) Some days I feel a bit overwhelmed with it all, I've got a range of appointments coming up with various health professionals over the coming weeks, but just trying to find out as much as possible at the moment esp around the dialysis options.Hi, just found this site.

"Renal Failure","Help","My story - 40 year old male - this week I visited my GP to collect what I thought was a routine series of tests.

I have done a scan, and while the doctor did not want to say much about the results, he has written on my referral that I have kidney disease. Seeing the nephrologist on Tuesday.I have been depressed and in a state of shock the past few days. I have a beautiful family including 2 young daughters who I could not bear to leave behind. It seems like the world is going on around me like usual, while mine is falling apart.I am seeking information on the following points, it would be greatly appreciated.a) How long have you managed to stay alive on dialysis? What things have helped you continue your life (e.g. diet). How have you avoided heart problems, which seem to stop many people.b) Have you managed to work and maintain some kind of lifestyle while you are on dialysis?c) How early can you get on the kidney donor register? Is it a simple process?Any info would be greatly appreciated."

"Renal Failure","Transplant costs","I will be referred for transplant eligibility evaluation soon. Of course I'm just taking all of this one step at a time. At this point I don't know that I'll qualify. But as I am waiting this out, I'd love to hear from those who have been trough this, especially in the United States. I'm working and so have Blue Cross Blue Sheild ( Plan C) through my job. While the patient responsibility has gone up, for all medical care, once I've met the patient responsibility each year my medical costs are covered in full. My prescription meds are included in my annual patient responsibility although I receive all of them through a separate insurance company. I don't believe either policy has a lifetime cap for coverage. I'll check these issues out with my insurance companies this week.However, I would appreciate hearing from any who are comfortable sharing, how did you pay for your transplant? (I'm hoping to get ideas regarding additional funding sources. And I do realize that if I qualify for a transplant and decide to move forward with that treatment option, I'll meet with a social worker for detailed financial guidance. I'm just trying to get some preliminary information--I'm quite the advanced planner🐶.)In addition, what do the anti rejection drugs cost monthly? If you're on medicare, are they covered by medicare? If so, Are they covered in full or at the 80% rate? Does a supplemental insurance plan, ie, medigap policy, pick up the remainder?Frankly, I was surprised that my nephrologist plans to refer me for testing as I'll be 65 years old in August of 2018. So I realize that my age may preclude me from qualifying. However, he referring me in for testing so I realize my age may not be a factor.Well, I appreciate any thing you would each feel comfortable sharing. And, again, I'm just taking this one step at a time🐶🐶 But it is encouraging to learn I may still be eligible for a transplant. Nevertheless, whatever happens, I'm actually fine with the outcome. I'm ready to start PD dialysis and expect it will be fine. This discussion group has played a significant role in helping me to reach that point.So, thank you!!Marj"

"Renal Failure","Terrified of Kidney Failure after friend nearly had it","Hello, new to this site, so apologies if this turns out to be the wrong place to post this.I'm a rather young individual, only 22, so maybe my fear is mislead. But a friend very dear to me was in the hospital and found her kidneys almost shutting down when she went in for leg pains. According to her, the doctors say it was a mixture of drinking too much liquids, and what medications she was on, which now has me terrified as I tend to drink all throughout the day due to constantly feeling thirsty.Looking up symptoms, I possess three things that seem to be frequent symptoms of Kidney Failure, but I'm unsure if it truly is a sign or if it's just because of how poor my lifestyle is as a whole.One is constantly feeling tired, though frankly I've felt like this for years, and was told it may be a case caused by my anti-depressants or depression as a whole.Two is shortness of breath, but again I'm unsure, as I admit I'm not the healthiest individual, and I wonder if it's simply a case of being out of shape.And three is frequent urination with not much output. Again, unsure if something serious, or simply a case of how I drink liquids as much as I do.All the other supposed symptoms I've seen, such as constantly feeling cold and foamy urine aren't present in me (In fact, I tend to feel hot more often than I do cold, but it may be because I tend to dress in long sleeves/pants even on warm days.) So I know I probably sound paranoid, frankly I admit I am a hypochondriac, but I don't truly know, which terrifies me.My question is, how would I truly know if my kidneys are failing? I've had blood work done very recently, though I've had no call back, so I assume that's a sign that nothing major was found (Though I'm unsure what the blood work completely entailed, as all I know was it was fasting and I had to avoid taking some of my medications for it.) Is my constant drinking of liquids condemning me to a bad fate, when I only mean to drink as much as I do because of this constant, thirsty feeling?'

"Renal Failure","CKD Stage 3, Age 22 - is this CKD?","Hello Everyone,A little background about myself:I do not have diabetes or high blood pressure. I have no family history of CKD. I am 22 years old, Asian. I regularly go to the gym and did not have any signs of CKD until December 2016. I have no pain in my kidneys and mostly have little to no symptoms of CKD (however, I am aware that symptoms may not show until later stages).I had a blood test back in December, 2016 and it showed a my eGFR levels to be below the normal range. It was around 75 then. I took another blood test in June and my eGFR levels went down to around 60. I started to see a nephrologist in June and he told me to drink more water and take another blood test in September. In September, my eGFR levels went down to 45, putting me in stage 3 CKD. I was also tested for creatine phosphokinase, CK, where my CK levels were 730 (normal range is 20 - 200). My nephrologist told me he believes it is rhabdomyolysis due to overtraining where the muscle is breaking down. However, i am very doubtful it is rhabdomyolysis because I did not have any of the symptoms and do not think I workout hard enough to reach that point.Now my nephrologist told me stop doing strenuous activity - weightlifting and essentially exercising - and take another blood test and urine test in mid October. (this seems weird to recommend a patient to not exercise). I am constantly worrying about my health and am hoping this is not CKD and just temporary kidney damage due to some cause.Questions I have:1) Can people with CKD have a decline in eGFR levels of 30 within just 9 months?2) Is there any relation between eGFR (or Creatinine; Serum) and Creatine Phosphokinase (CK)?3) Is my nephrologist overlooking the possibility of CKD? Do I have CKD? Is there no medication available to slow the process of my CKD?4) What should I do?Thank you everyone who can help provide insight about my situation. - Brian"
"Renal Failure","PD Drain Pain and Slow Drain Fixed","On a visit to my specialist 29/07/2017 he increased my Calcitriol from 2 a day to 3 a day, after about 6 weeks on the new dosage I started to get abdominal pain on my left side about where appendix would be if it was on left side, my draining was slowing down and I developed constipation which I controlled with laxatives, I was due to see specialist at the end of September (around 2 weeks from the start of my symptoms) I had my usual monthly blood tests 4 days before my appointment, 2 days after blood testsmy Home Dialysis rang to say my Calcium levels were high, as I was seeing my specialist in 2 days we decided to wait for his opinion, I suggested it was because of the increase in Calcitriol, in the last week before my appointment the drain pain was unbearable and it was taking around 45 minutes to drain instead of the usual 15 - 20 minutes and on a couple of occasions I couldn't fully empty because of the pain and slow drain, on seeing my specialist he agreed that the Calcitriol had increased my calcium and reduced it to one pill a day for 3 days and then 2 a day from then on, he said the high Calcium could cause the constipation which in turn could slow my drain, the pain could have been caused by a shift in the catheter so he gave me a referral for Xray if things didn't improve in a couple of days, I didn't think that constipation was the cause of my drain problems as I was popping enough laxatives to move things along, after around 3 days of reduced Calcitriol the pain started to ease and draining was getting faster, after 7 days everything was back to normal with drain time around 15 minutes and the fluid out was back to average, for 2 days I got double my average of extra fluid and my weight dropped about 1.2kg so I reckon I was carrying around 1kg of extra fluid. I have no doubts that the Calcium spike caused all of my drain problems, at the time it was happening I didn't even think about the Calcitriol was causing my problems so if you are having similar symptoms then maybe discuss Calcium levels with your doctor. I'm not saying that it is the answer for your problems so don't stop taking medication without talking it over with your Specialist or GP, it for sure was the cause of my problem, if you do discuss this with your doctor please feel free to reference to my experience.On a visit to my specialist 29/07/2017 he increased my Calcitriol from 2 a day to 3 a day, after about 6 weeks on the new dosage I started to get abdominal pain on my left side about where appendix would be if it was on left side, my draining was slowing down and I developed constipation which I controlled with laxatives, I was due to see specialist at the end of September (around 2 weeks from the start of my symptoms) I had my usual monthly blood tests 4 days before my appointment, 2 days after blood testsmy Home Dialysis rang to say my Calcium levels were high, as I was seeing my specialist in 2 days we decided to wait for his opinion, I suggested it was because of the increase in Calcitriol, in the last week before my appointment the drain pain was unbearable and it was taking around 45 minutes to drain instead of the usual 15 - 20 minutes and on a couple of occasions I couldn't fully empty because of the pain and slow drain, on seeing my specialist he agreed that the Calcitriol had increased my calcium and reduced it to one pill a day for 3 days and then 2 a day from then on, he said the high Calcium could cause the constipation which in turn could slow my drain, the pain could have been caused by a shift in the catheter so he gave me a referral for Xray if things didn't improve in a couple of days, I didn't think that constipation was the cause of my drain problems as I was popping enough laxatives to move things along, after around 3 days of reduced Calcitriol the pain started to ease and draining was getting faster, after 7 days everything was back to normal with drain time around 15 minutes and the fluid out was back to average, for 2 days I got double my average of extra fluid and my weight dropped about 1.2kg so I reckon I was carrying around 1kg of extra fluid.

Mum has had subclavial, neck, groin lines and also grafs on both her arms and also had a neckline. The students in the hospitals are always interested to see what she has had done. I am at a point of desperation now with my father as our hospital has advised there is no other way to get mum onto dialysis. My question is does anyone in the United Kingdom know of this and which hospital is has been used in? Mum has not had dialysis since wednesday last week and her potassium is hopefully staying at 4.6.

"Renal Failure","Kidney Function Decreasing","I'm afraid I've damaged my kidneys by taking a lot of ibuprofen for head and muscle pain during the course of 8 weeks. I also had an MRI with contrast dye during this time. Three different doctors told me to take 600 mg. of ibuprofen every 6 to 8 hours for the head and body pain (1800 mg. daily). I usually took the medicine about every 7 to 8 hours. There were days I took less ibuprofen and some days I didn't need it at all. The fact remains that I took a lot of ibuprofen. The contrast dye probably didn't help matters either. In March and June of this year (I was not taking ibuprofen at the time) my creatine levels were within range, 0.9 with 1.0 being the high end. Both tests revealed that my EST GFR was greater than 60. I didn't pay attention to the fact that the results didn't give me an actual number. The lab I use doesn't give a specific number if the GFR comes back greater than 60. The result simply shows that the GFR > 60. I don't know how much greater than 60 my GFR was either time. Had I known then what I know now about kidney functioning, I would not have taken the ibuprofen nor allowed the technician to inject contrast dye during the MRI. I had lab work done in late August and found to my dismay that my creatine level exceeded the range. The level should be no greater than 1.0., mine was 1.1. My GFR had dropped to 50. My primary care physician didn't seem concerned. He told me to eat and drink more than I do. Recently, I've lost a lot of weight due to a variety of health problems. When I got home I started researching particulars about kidneys and was dismayed to find that my kidneys are only functioning at 50%. I have stopped taking ibuprofen. I've increased my water intake and am trying to eat a wider variety of healthier foods. Does anyone have experience like this? Can a GFR increase once the ibuprofen is out of the system? I can't help wondering if the contrast dye did some permanent damage as well.

"Renal Failure","Hello. GFR 6 and medication change","I went to see my nephrologist yesterday and it seems my GFR is now down to 6 and I am finding any kind of activity draining. The neph. has taken me off amlodipine and perindorpril and has not prescribed any new medication.I have again declined the offer of dialysis and I am wondering not what happens next -- I have a fair idea of that -- but how long do I have? Will I manage to make it to Christmas?My potassium is 5 and my haemoglobin is the lower end of normal, although my BP was 158/92 yesterday.Any help from long-term members here would be a God-send. Thank you all in anticipation."

"Renal Failure","Tomorrow is the Day","As I have mentioned in earlier posts, my regular nephrologist has referred me to a university medical center nephrology department. He says I should have much more renal function than I've got. My function plummeted to between 14-15% this past December. My nephrologist thinks this is due to severe, chronic dehydration related to sodium deficiency. He has me ingesting 3000 mg of sodium daily right now. I do feel better and, incredibly, am not having much trouble with fluid retention. But he's not sure what is causing this and so can't be sure how to treat it.So, after a four month wait, I'll finally see the university nephrologist tomorrow, Wed, Aug 16th. My emotions are all over the place. But more than anything, I'm just hoping for some answers--even if that does mean dialysis.Well, thanks for taking time to read this post. I have really appreciated your willingness to share what you've each learned as you have adjusted to living with chronic kidney disease. It has lowered my stress and given me hope. So, I will go to this appointment with much less stress.Marj"

"Renal Failure","how to Prepare My House for Dialysis","As I have mentioned in an earlier post, I am a single person who lives alone. My nephrologist has begun discussing dialysis options with me. He says I'm a good candidate for PD dialysis which o would be able to do at home independently. I've begun reading about PD dialysis. It looks as though it requires considerable storage space. (I live in a modest, 2 bedroom condominium with an attached garage.) it occurs to me that it might be beneficial for me to begin preparing my home for dialysis.With that idea in mind, what might I do to prepare my home for dialysis? I'm considering pulling my carpet out and replacing it with luxury vinyl plank flooring. That would certainly be easier to clean than carpet. I plan to convert my spare bedroom into the dialysis room. Would shelving of some sort be helpful? Marj"
"Renal Failure","GFR falling, creatanine rising, I'm panicking!","Hi all, Sorry this is a long post... I hope someone will have some idea of what is happening to me! I am a 60 year old woman with no history of kidney trouble. I am not a diabetic, blood pressure normally fine, not overweight, no alcohol/smoking, healthy vegetarian diet all my adult life, daily exercise. I don't use NSAIDs at all, just paracetamol in moderation. I do have autoimmune Hashimotos thyroid disease (underactive thyroid), since about 9 yrs ago, and take the meds for that, but I still have problems with hypothyroid symptoms, and have been referred to a specialist for that. I also have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia several years ago. So the only meds I take are levothyroxine and paracetamol. Anyhow, that's my background.My routine kidney function tests have always shown eGFR at >90. It was >90 in Feb 2016. The next test in Oct 2016 was 88. Then this year in Jan it was 75, then a little up in March at 77. Now, in June, it's down to 68. Creatinine has risen from 57 in Feb 16, to 81 now in June. With a GFR drop of 9 in just 10 weeks, I am worried that my next test will go below 60. The total drop is 22 in 18 months. Surely this is not OK? I know kidney function declines with age, but at this rate? I dont know what happened between Feb and Oct last year to injure my kidneys. I did have a bladder infection and a course of ciproflox in that time period. Could this have caused kidney damage?I am to have another blood test in 6 weeks and have a urine test to do for blood, albumen and protein. I bought some urine dipsticks, and occasionally get a slight trace of protein indicated, other times nil. When I say slight trace, I mean the little green block gets a tinge of darker (trace) colour around the edges. Does anyone know what a decline like this represents? I wonder if I have some sort of autoimmune kidney problem related to the thyroid, but I guess I have a long time to wait to find out. Any comments/ideas greatly appreciated. Thank you so much."

"Renal Failure","Low Stage IV - dialysis questions","Hello everyone??I'm new to this forum but am hoping to get some information and support. So a little about my situation:I was diagnosed with Stage IIIB CKD on Halloween, October 31, in 2011. My creatinine was 1.2 at that time. It remained stable until May of 2013 when it plummeted to 3.2. My nephrologist jumped into high gear at that point. My kidneys rebounded to 2.2 and stabled there until December of 2016 when they plummeted again, this time my creatinine dropped to 4.2 with an eGFR of 10. There has been some improvement. My creatinie iOS now at 3.4 with 14% percent function. I've been referred in to a nephrologist at the University of Kansas Medical Center which will occur on August 16, 2017. Im hopeful this appointment will at least provide some answers as to what is going on--my nephrologist has completed a biopsy and says I should have ""much more function"" than I've got. I also have no extra protein in my urine which he says is supposed to be another predictive measure.I'm single and live alone. Frankly, it has been pretty challenging to cook for myself and so forth due to the extreme anemia. The anemia is now under effective treatment but has been pretty difficult. I've been able to continue working full time. (I'm a university professor.) I'm actually the last family member living in my immediate family. Do, I'm going to n Ed to navigate Stage V renal care alone.My nephrologist has said that I'm an ideal candidate for PD dialysis. He says I would be able to continue working while on PD and should also continue exercising coding. He also says I should be able to live 15 years or more on APD. (I'm in my mid-60s right now.) he has also talked with me about the possibility of a transplant; but, I'm not at all sure that I want to pursue that option.The questions I've got right now are1. What have your experiences been with PD dialysis? Are they consistent with what my nephrologist has told me?2. Whatbproblems, if any, did you encounter while on PD?3. Did you have many infections while on Zpd?3. What are your thoughts about transplants? Have any of you chosen not to pursue a transplant? What sorts of issues caused you to decide against the transplant?Thanks so much for taking time to read my post and I hope to hear back from several of you.Marj"

"Renal Failure","eGFR 14-creatinine 3.4, Stage V gathering information","My renal function deteriorated from eGFR of 29, where it had been stable for 4 years, to an eGFR of 14 this past December. I'm visiting with my medical team about treatment options. But I would like to hear a little about patient experiences with the two options I'm considering:PD dialysisKidney transplantI'm a university professor and hope to b able to continue working full time. I'm also hoping I'll be able to execise daily. Given my age, I'm not sure I want to go through the transplant surgery. I realiz that is likely an unusual situation, but my thinking is that PD dialysis sounds as though it is quite ""doable"" and is a treatment option that is often viable for 15 years or so. That would put me close to 80 years of age, fairly close to the average age of life for a woman my age. And, I realize that I would likely still be eligible for in-center HD dialysis at that point. If so, between both dialysis treatment options, I would likely experience a ""typical"" length of life. I live alone. My doctors say that I'm an excellent candidate for PD dialysis. Of course, we don't yet know about transplant eligibility. (I will go through testing to determine if that is actually a viable option.)So, I would greatly appreciate hearing from any of you who are willing to share a little about your experiences with either of these treatment options--what was a typical day in your life like while receiving that treatment option? A week? Were you able to keep working? Full time? Part time? How long did it take you to recover from the surgery associated with the treatment option you chose? Adjust to the treatment? And finally, as one who has walked the walk, so to speak, what words of wisdom do you have to share with me.Thank you for taking time to read and respond to my post!Marj"

"Renal Failure","Opinions & Advice re ACR","Hi, new here and I have received a letter today for a follow up appt from my recent annual review at my diabetic clinic. The appt is for September and it is discuss my increased ACR. Wondered if anyone could offer any input?Background- Female, 40 in couple of months, non-smoker/drinker.- Dx Type 1 aged 30 (just over 9yrs ago). Insulin dependent.- Naturally very slim, weight never goes beyond 56kg.- Cholesterol/HDL/LDL/Trigs always within normal range.- BP always low-mid end of normal range.- HbA1c (blood glucose test) has consistently been in the 40's for as long as I can think back which signifies tight control. Now, I've had to cast my mind back, but I had a couple of consecutive clinic reviews in the past (likely between 2011-14) where I was required to repeat my urine sample due to slightly increased protein. I made sure I was very well hydrated on the repeat tests and they came back fine.So here are the results of my last three lots of tests:2015 - ACR: 4.6mg/mmol- eGFR: 82ml/min- Creatinine: 70umol/L2016 - ACR: 2.1mg/mmol- eGFR: 79ml/min- Creatinine: 72umol/L2017 - ACR: 3.8mg/mmol- eGFR: 86ml/min- Creatinine: 66umol/LSo, I have had fluctuating ACRS and slightly decreased eGFRs. I don't actually understand the creatinine as I keep coming across different range values online. So, my questions are; is there anything that particularly leaps out regarding my values? Anything especially bad or good or how they read as a whole? Especially considering my normal BP/Cholesterol, generally good blood glucose control and the fact that I have been diabetic less than 10yrs (most kidney probs seem to start at least 15yrs in, but obviously I'm generalising). Secondly, I assume this follow-up appt is to discuss possible medication. Now, the consultant's report in 2016 acknowledged the fluctuating ACR and mentioned the possible use if ACEI's but stated that given my low BP it was doubtful I could cope with even a small amount of this medication. So, what happens in this instance? Are there any alternatives considering kidney problems seem so tied up with hypertension?Also, would insufficient hydration have much bearing on these results?Any advice gratefully received."

"Renal Failure","Left hanging...severe anxiety...please help!","I am on the verge of losing everhthing: family and mental health. I am scared beynd belief, my life is spiraling out of control and I feel I have nothing solid to hold onto.I can't seem to get enough information from my nephrologist that would give me some complete peace of mind. If you could help with any encouraging view, God bless you! I have been living in fear and doubt for almost a year now and my family is about to give up on me. Briefly, I first became alert to the kidney issue when I noticed a drop in egFR from 98 to 77 in my annual labs. This was right a few months after I got sick with pneumonia (with infection in the left lung) from which I recovered. I asked my pcp about the drop - and she said it's still normal kidney functiion and that it can drop with age, could be some dehydration too, etc. Next year I insisted on referral to Nephrology because I felt something was not right with an e-GFR in the 70's at the age of 42-43.I am now 44 and since then I have had GFR-s in the 70's and 80's. It never went back into the 90's where I was before pneumonia.Nephrology found some very low-grade proteinuria right around 200 mg/24h (barely outside of normal). Everything else normal, including ultrasound. No HBP or diabetes, grerat cholesterol.A recent test when I ate less protein and lyed down during the day quite a lot came back at < 110 mg/24 h (normal); so I am suspecting some postural/orthostatic protein drop too out of those 200 mg I seem to normally have. These are eGFR numbers since 2014:July 2014: 98July 2015: 77Nov 2015: 86Aug 2016: 75Septeber 2016: 82October 2016 (repeat): 84April 2017: 72 (lowest yet)My nephrologist's conclusion was that ""even though my collection is consistent with some CKd stage 2, he does not think that clinically, I have CKD at this point"". He told me that the little proteinuria I have is clinically insignificant, that there can be many benign reasons for a little proteinuria and that my kidneys, while not perfect, will last me ""another 90 years"".I had a 6 months follow-up recently, and despite about the same level of protein and a drop from 84 to 72, he says it's just normal variation, nothibg eslle to talk about. He tried to reassure me seeral times that I don't hace CKD.My fears come from reading all the info online. Technically speaking, I do qualify. And if right now I don't' have a diagnosis, I am terrified that soon I wll - inevitably.Please tell me:1) Is it possible my dr. is right and I don't have it?2) Is it possible this is just variation and it won't progress?3) If it does...how long do people stage in earlier stages 2 and 3?4) Is there any chance I could see an impprvement in serum creatinine and implicitly e-GFR with serious lifestyle changes? I spoke with a naturopath and she presscribes some lifestyle changes and some anti-inflammaroy supplements.Please help with some reassurance as I am hanging between only a faint hope of returning to the world and irreverisible break down."

"Renal Failure","Possible Kidney Failure?","Good afternoon, I'm looking for a bit of advice really. My father-in-law has stage 4 metastatic prostate cancer which has spread to at least his lymph nodes and adrenal gland (possibly further). The doctors know he has problems with his kidney function but recently he has had extensive lymphodema in one leg (it is literally twice the size) and has had a scan and blood test yesterday to rule out a clot which it did but it has shown he has low protein levels. I used to be a nurse and although I have limited medical knowledge I know that both of these symptoms are signs of kidney failure but all his GP has done is give him some protein shakes. He eats a fair amount of protein already, in fact the problem we have is getting him to eat vegetables with whatever he is having as he tends to eat a piece of fish or a couple of chicken kievs on their own (I do cook for him but he often doesn't fancy it and gets his own) so again, this suggests to me that his kidneys aren't absorbing protein correctly. He doesn't really retain a lot of information these days so I don't know what has been discussed with him but it seems to me that if he is showing signs of kidney failure they should be doing more than just giving him protein shakes and sending him on his way, particularly as they know his kidney function is already compromised. I don't really know what to do next as neither his GP nor consultant seem to be that bothered about it. In other people's experience are these typical symptoms of kidney failure? He does also get pains in his chest and breathlessness sometimes. If so I will put some pressure on the doctor to do some more investigations.

"Renal Failure","25 year old diagnosed with IgA Nephrotic disease ","Monday I went to hospital to see the Renal Kidney Doctor and was told my results from my Kidney Biopsy. I have been diagnosed with IgA Nephropathy which is a type of Glomerulonephritis (Kidney Disease) The Kidney Biopsy was to determine how severe of a disease I had, I found out that very answer. My Kidneys are not going to last, the estimated guess is anywhere between a few months to a year, I will have to go on Kidney Dialysis and I will have to have a Kidney Transplant. At the minute there’s too much to take in, a number of blood tests will be carried out to see what kind of supplements and vitamins I need to try to keep my Kidney’s as stable as they possibly can and my blood pressure pills that I take every morning have been upped.I am so scared of this disease and I will try to fight as hard as I can but I'm so scared that it will beat me.

"Renal Failure","ESKD","Hi my dad has ENKD he first got this in about 1993 and was lucky enough to get a transplant within 6 month this kidney went on to last for 11 years when it failed once more he then had a long wait but was fortunate to get another kidney transplant in 2013 after 9 years of been on dialysis. Since this he has been really unlucky with his health with his aorta tearing in 2014 meaning he was in hospital for a very long time! Since this his kidney has started to fail! In December he was diagnosed with Emphysema, has become very breathless even while just sat on the sofa he struggles! A nurse came out to see him today to talk about dialysis and things and said his kidney was at 12% she said they don't think that it is beneficial for him to have dialysis with the struggles he has with his breathing from to doing simple tasks like standing up! his right lung also has pleural effusion and his left one has a small amount of pleural effusion! He struggles to eat aswel as after 3 mouthfuls he becomes very breathless so in turn makes him lose his appetite! Is there anything out there that can help my dad without dialysis? His skin is looking yellow now is this because of his kidney? Could you recommend something which would be easy for him to eat or drink to get the nutrition he needs? He is already on Maxi Dual powder which he has in every cup of tea he drinks. Thanks "
"Renal Failure","CKD3B AND UTI","I am just experiencing my third chest infection since December - most unusual for me who rarely gets a cold. During the second bout of chest infection I had a night of frequency/urgency followed by my urine looking cloudy. This appearance has continued into this third chest infection and, although I never get UTIs, I asked if the surgery could check a urine specimen. This came back showing UTI and the Trimethoprim that I had been prescribed for three days turned out to be the wrong antibiotic to treat the bacteria. I am now to be prescribed Cefalexin for 7 days. Am concerned about taking this drug, not least because of my low kidney function (I have only one kidney with a present eGFR of 39), but also because I am allergic to penicillin - although it isn't a penicillin, the GP mentioned that anyone allergic to penicillin can have an allergic reaction to this medicine. And I do not have a good history as far as drug side effects are concerned! Apparently there is no other medication that will treat the bacteria involved. I would be grateful to hear from anyone who has experience with Cefalexin - it would be so reassuring to hear that it didn't impact on their CKD.I am just experiencing my third chest infection since December - most unusual for me who rarely gets a cold.

I am a 27 year old female , in August 2016 I was rushed to hospital with sepsis and was very poorly ! It is unknown how I got sepsis , although whilst being treated in hospital I has severe left sided kidney pain and could barely move! I was told I had a kidney injury. When I left hospital my GFR and creatinine were all in range. GFR over 90. The back pain went off after 2 weeks of being discharged from hospital. November or 2016 I was still having checkups with dr and I complained of the back pain I experienced in hospital returning but not a sharp pain this time just a dull ache. He did some blood tests and it came back my gfr was 60 & creatinine 101. This blood test was repeated 4 weeks later (I was advised to drink lots of water ) my results this time was that my gfr was 59 and creatinine 103. I had 2 water infections after these tests and my back pain continued over Xmas and new year. I didn't drink any alcohol over the Xmas period. I have recently had another blood test (January 2017 ) my GFR is now 56 and my creatine is 108. I still have the back pain and blood in my urine when dipped by dr and now my periods have become erratic with regular spotting through out my cycle ! I have been referred to the urologist as urgent and will be seeing him on Monday (20th Feb) I would like to know if anyone has had the same experience and if I should be worried ?

I was back last Sunday this time with Seizures, tremors and vertigo - vertigo started at the hospital when I was first seen for the seizures. Again, a few Valium and off I went. Well, I pulled up my labs online because I was told they were ""normal"" and I know that means nothing.

I have full body muscle atrophy (due to the infections) and also do not eat a ton of meat so those numbers going up do not make sense. Especially with the decrease in GFR. I am not dehydrated.

In the last 2 days I have only peed a couple times during the day. I do pee a lot at night still. I have taken 6-9 ibuprofen a day for probably 10+ years along with other meds. My question is should I be concerned about those numbers changing so fast? My chloride is also 109. Calcium, potassium, sodium have also increased but in range. I was also shocked to see my magnesium was not deficient I since that is one thing most of Americans are depleated of. Especially chronically sick people. Thanks in advance for the help!"
"Renal Failure","KIDNEY FUNCTIONING ","Hi I have been told on 2 occasion by my doctor after a blood test that I have low kidney functioning so she sent me to see a specialist after seeing the specialist my results for blood test came back normal and scan also showed nothing wrong with my kidneys does this mean that sometimes the blood test can show up normal and sometimes not is this normal does it mean I have CKD if anyone can shine a light please would be most grateful.Thanks"

He further stated the last baseline was in 2011 when my GFR was 52 previously 59 in 2007, which demonstrated my deterioration was slow and CKD probably likely caused by infection over the years. he took into consideration that my mum who died in 1999 at 55yrs with no understood reason for her failure may or may not be a genetic condition but did not feel this warrants biopsy at this stage on its own.

"Renal Failure","Cancer A Must Read ","CANCER .............More people are employed in the cancer industry than die from cancer. (charity collectors, research scientists, pharmacies, addvertisers, and the sale of chemo, etc etc etc) Cancer is not the problem but the symptom (in other words what caused the cancer in the first place is the problem) there is no cure for cancer only effective treatments (as in influenza) Cancer is due to a vitamin and mineral deficiency in the body caused by diet, not by smoking cigarettes (not advising anyone to smoke here) Cancer is a multi-trillion dollar industry in the western world Dehydration of the cell also is a big factor and causes the cell to wrongly mutate. (the advantage of drinking at least two litres of water a day cannot be emphasised enough here, and you should drink PH Balanced water such as the ALKALIFE brand) Sugar and fat feeds cancer,white sugar, white bread, white flower, create cancer.Presently it’s the treatments that kill cancer patients not the disease (people look as if they have just survived a concentration camp after receiving the treatment) The pharmaceutical companies exclusively sponsor and conduct the research on cancer and are seeking a synthetic drug so they can patent it and make more money out of the disease. ( this is a fact no herbal treatments are entertained ..because they cannot be patented) Cancer mirrors perfectly what happened in the same situation with scurvy 300 years ago i.e. the disease was down to vitamin c deficiency the powers at be knew this but for 200 years the colonial powers of Britain, Holland, France, Spain, Portugal , lost tens of thousands of sailors to this disease. ( this is a fact please research)There is more money in the research than the cure. Any other treatment other than drug based, chemo or surgery are rubbished by the media as quackery .Pharmaceutical companies have the full subject/industry of cancer covered and protect it vigorously, no successful treatment is entertained as there cannot be any money to be made from it. In some cases people are prosecuted for speaking out against the morbidity of Chemo against successful treatmentsI could go on ............... This is usually what I send people when they contact me regarding cancer.All this info usually is a shock to the system to most people but I ask all people that approach me to take a deep breath and think about the full subject. In short Cancer is a huge money making industry and after many years what has been achieved. It has been desensitised by the media to the disgusting effect of pink clothes day, rugby league wearing pink socks, daffodil day, shave your head, and even Mother’s day has been hijacked by this dark greedy streak of self-interest money grabbing elitists.all the money raised for cancer research is not used to find cures, it's used to find cancer earlier, (Early Detection) so they can have a Chemo patient that is more profitable, dont cure him, but keep him on Chemo longer, we must have eaqrly detection for earlier profits. Strong words indeed but I have not given any money to Cancer or its various foundations for over 14 years now and the only way to stop this awful misery is for people to stop taking the treatments presented, i.e. Chemo, Radiation, or surgery. Or as I prefer to call it Poison, Burn, and cut.Black Salv is extremely effective for ALL and every type of skin or melanoma cancer I have witnessed this now about 15 times and is successful in tumours close to the surface. However it is banned…they even banned it quite recently from vets using it as it works the same for animals. Its banned because its successful and if it was accepted every dermatologist working in the cancer industry would be made redundant. Remember turkeys don’t vote for Christmas, chickens wont vote for KFC and petroleum companies do not vote for electric cars…this is capitalism in the past/modern era …extreme and evil capitalism.Cancer is due to a mineral and vitamin deficiency and not just down to cigarettes. However if you’re a heavy smoker and your mineral/vitamin level is deficient then you will get lung cancer. The same with sun exposure and skin cancer (incidentally it’s the radiation that’s the real contributor here), and if you eat rubbish which will directly lead to mineral/vitamin deficiency then you will get bowel, prostrate, stomach, and pancreatic cancers ete. Remember they are predicting one in two people will get cancer at 65 or over….what on earth is going on..??? In short if I was told tomorrow that I had cancer it I would embark on the following treatment.........Immediately start on Hydrogen Peroxide daily (will supply details of in gestation on request 35% Food or Lab grade) Take at least 25 apricot kernels a day.Take 4-6 iodine drops daily in a glass of waterEmbark on a high dose vitamin C diet encompassing taking one 10.000 – 20.000 mg vitamin C tablets daily.Undertake the 20 day black salv treatment. ( I am still out on the internal Plus Black Salv, but the ointment for skin cancer I have witnessed about 10 cases of how successful it works including my brother-in-law twice) Cut out sugar immediately (sugar feeds cancer)Cut down on dairy products and carbo-hydrates immediatelyIncorporate in my daily diet freshly made up vegetable juices from organic vegies like celery, ginger, carrots (that would bePurple carrots by the way), would tend to use vegies rather than fruits as fruits have natural sugars in them.Incorporate in my daily diet large amounts of Ginger and Turmeric ( Talking about the root here simmer covered for half an hour then drink with honey) Incorporate cinnamon & honey into my daily diet.Incorporate Himalayan salt into my daily diet via water. (Has 84 trace elements in it)Get at least half hour s sunshine daily."

It was a shock to me because I'm 41, play tennis, very energetic, bp is normal, sugar levels normal, cholesterol is low, height weight proportionate and I hate salt. The only thing I don't do is drink much water or liquids even during or after exercise. For today's blood test I made sure to drink quite a bit of water since a day before and no protein, not sure if this will make a difference. But it's something I didn't do for my last blood work. I also take ibeprofin on occasion, and I've read ibeprofin can lower GFR levels. Do levels fluctuate from day to day or does not drinking much liquids or water lower levels considerably? Thanks, "

"Renal Failure","CKD - Stage 5 - How long does it last?","Hello all,My mother, who is 87, has a large number of health issues: rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, Type 2 Diabetes. The main one, though - caused by years of Methotrexate use (which she stopped taking about 18 months ago) - is Chronic Kidney Disease. Some time in the last 6 months, it reached Stage 5. During that time, she's been hospitalised twice: once for hyperkalaemia, and the second time (as a result of the confusion she's now experiencing) for not taking her meds properly. She had a full review of her meds on the last discharge (a month ago), and she's now taking them all properly.Her memory lapses have become the most worrying symptom. At first we thought they were caused by UTIs, and she took antibiotics for a while. But she's now infection-free, and the lapses continue. Her GP said it's all part of the illness. We've now got a carer, who visits her every morning to check her with her meds, and I go in every evening and at weekends to check up on her, do any shopping she needs, etc. She still lives independently, otherwise, and doesn't want to move from where she is. I understand this, as the emotional disruption of leaving a place where she's been happy could be drastic. We're also awaiting a Social Services needs assessment.I know this isn't going to get any better, and will only get worse. My question is... how long does this leave her? Will there be other symptoms at a later stage that indicate a final decline? Thanks for any help anyone can offer "

"Renal Failure","Criteria/rules for diagnosis of CKD 2","I'd be interested to hear from anyone who has found out about the condition by accident or who had a diagnosis based solely on a blood test which showed a GFR below 90 without evidence from further tests. . I have just found out by accident that a hospital has given me a diagnosis of CKD stage 2 no proteinuria based solely on my blood test codes which have shown a GFR between 60 and 90 since 2011. My GP didn’t mention it to me at all. I have just queried it with the GP and have been told that the current GFR of 61 is normal for my age (53) and isn’t a problem because my tests for creatinine, potassium (all wastage functions) etc. are normal. The GFR has fluctuated but has never been below 60. They don’t have a diagnosis of CKD on my records because of this.Is it common for a diagnosis of CKD to be made just on a blood test by a different department? I don’t know whether to be angry with the GP for not telling me or the hospital for diagnosing without actual evidence of damage to the kidney. I was told that the 'diagnosis' will remain on my hospital records due to blood test codes.I have been told that most people over 50 have a GFR under 90 so, without further tests, this would give a lot more people a diagnosis of CKD 1/2"

I was told at the time that the results were normal/clear but the urologist insisted on a referral to a nephrologist (in January) because of non visible blood traces in the urine. More recently I asked a GP for actual figures from the blood tests.. She gave them to me without saying which test was which! The figures were 90 and 71. I am hoping that 90 was the eGFR.

"Renal Failure","Creatinine level after nephrectomy","I’m 61 years old and had a radical nephrectomy (left kidney) seven weeks ago because of a tumor (benign) and last week had labs that showed creatinine of 1.9. My doc (the surgeon) told me that I need to have more labs in 5 months and that if the creatinine was any higher I would have a problem and have to go on a “horrible” low protein diet. I asked him if the chances were good that the number would be stable and he looked away from me and said there was a chance, but he wasn’t convincing. He also told me I could eat what I want, and I eat healthily and watch the protein, but not a kidney specific diet. Now my right side aches sometimes and I’m worried that it’s my one and only. If the number is higher than the 1.9 will it mean CKD? And does that mean that eventually I will I end up on dialysis? Should I go on a more restrictive diet until I have labs? Thank you for reading.

"Renal Failure","Frustrated with the lack of support and advice","Having worked for teh NHS for the past 9 years on a wellbeing team delivering health checks, I thought I should go for my midlife check and practice what I preach. So in December last year age 41 I went along to my GP.My results were all absolutely fine, my BMI and waist measurement are in a healthy range, blood pressure normal, I so not smoke and hardly drink plus ecercise 4 times a week - so when they said my GFR was abnormal I was shocked.Four more blood tests over the past 6 months are showing my gfr go from 58, 54, 56, 53 so the last appointment they gave me the label 'ckd stage 3)I have no family history of ckd, no diabetes, no high blood pressure - I have not taken drugs, never followed a high protein diet and dont take ibuprofen regularly.So the GP sent me for a ct scan - this came back that my kidneys are in the right place and are normal size - my bladder is working normally and I have no blood or protein in my urine.So back to the GP who referred me to a consultant (a little confused I think that I have absoutely no indicators or precursers to CKD and am considered young to have these results).The consultant has read my notes and refused to see me!!! Sent a letter back to the GP saying he needs to expalin my condition to me??I am absolutely disgusted with this attitiude as as 10 minute appointment with a specialist may have put my mind at ease and answred questions I have around 'why'. I am booked in to see my gp next week and other than asking for a private referral I dont know what to do. I feel like I am just being told 'oh well there is no reason why, you have been dealt a bad card - deal with it and we will see you once a year for a blood test'.I know I am far from in serious bad health and may never go on to develop later stages especially given my healthy lifestyle however, my children will now have to report a family hisory of CKD and I am sure they will want answers, I have suffered with insomnia for some years and horrendous water retention in my lower legs too - i wanted to ask the consultant if this was linked - I take iboprofen when running long distance (recommended by nhs physio) and salt replacement drinks - I wanted to ask about this too. Reading about this disease I have found links to pre-eclampsia (which I had) and lupus (which my nan had) so had questions on this.I am sorry for a long post guys and maybe its more common than I think that people are diagnosed with ckd and have absolutely no reason why - I just feel very let down that I have been given this label for the rest of my life and the nhs I pay into and work for dont want to help me sort the questions out clogging up my head.Any ideas, questions, answers you may have will be really appreciated.Thanks "
"Renal Failure","My Mum has just found out she has renal failure and has been given a few months to live.Help!!","Hi all,My Mum found out 5 weeks a go that she has stage 5 renal failure. The doctor's said she may only have 6 months to a year to live. Another doctor said 3 months to a year max. Her kidney function has declined rapidly since 2015, now only operating at 11%. She has other serious health conditions such as COPD, type 2 diabetes (insulin dependent), hypertension, high cholesterol, CHF and two years ago she suffered from deep vein thrombosis and almost lost her life. Approximately 20 years ago she had breast cancer and had her breast removed. She is a fighter that is for sure, but this latest news has come as a complete shock for her and for my family. From meeting with the doctors the feel seems to be for her to consider conservative treatment. She is only 64 years, and has fought so long, and wants to see her grand children grow up...they have told us the many complications that she may go through with dialysis and said it is dangerous if she has the operation for the cathether, and dangerous if she doesn't...I asked at the dialysis education session if there were any support groups or people we could talk to that have been in a similar situation and are either on dialysis or on the conservative treatment. They gave me a card with a facebook group. My Mum is not on facebook and neither am I. She wouldn't know how to use facebook...we have seen the surgeon and he said they can operate, although we are due to see the anethetist next week, so it is all up to him whether he is willing to risk putting her under general anaesthetic. We just don't know what to do. I don't want her to suffer, especially with her COPD, she already has difficulty breathing as it is. But we don't want her to give up either. At the end of the day it is her decision as she is the one who is going through this, although knowing my family we want her to LIVE. Any advice woudl be greatly appreciated..she has had an iron infusion which helped a bit, but now has a chest infection that is just not getting better. She is due to have her next blood test next week, we have our fingers and toes crossed that she is stable. I would like her to have more iron. Her legs are restless and she gets itchy. She is taking medicaiton for this...what should she do???thank you"

"Renal Failure","Does anyone on here have glomerulonephritis? ","Hello everyone, I am currently waiting on the results of a renal biopsy. The prelim is indicating acute glomerulonephritis. However, I will have to wait for the full results to see whether this is chronic and if there is any damage. I have noticed there isn't a great deal of information on the topic where people have discussed this themselves. Perhaps I have been looking in the wrong places. I currently have nephrotic range proteinuria, Hypoalbuminemia, hypertension, haematuria, and foamy urine (presumably caused by the protein). What I am trying to work out is - how common is it for acute to go undetected and eventually develop into chronic? And Should I be concerned about the protein in the urine? It's been around 3.8g, is there any way to reduce this? I have been noticing symptoms for a while, and the possible cause is an infection from a few years ago. Which leads me to thinking it is possibly chronic. If anyone has any knowledge in this area I would greatly appreciate it. As most people know, it is not easy waiting on test results. "

I still won't take it.My GFR is 49 and my kidneys, yes both hurt, often. It is not severe pain, but it's constant pain always seeming to change exact location. From twinges and spasms at the top of the kidneys, to low abdominal pain, to resting position overall pain.I don't see a specialist for another 3 weeks and I can't seem to find anything legitimate to help with the pain. I've tried heat, and at first it was comforting but then pain increased. Ice has the same reaction. First great, then more pain. If these are safe, which I find contradicting evidence about and why I'm asking, should I just do it for a smaller length of time? Is one better than the other? Or are one or both bad for the kidneys?Is there anything else that I can take to help with the pain? Obviously nothing prescribed is an option because of my GP and wait for specialist. So I need something natural I can buy over the counter. Please someone help me, I'm quite frustrated, in pain, and feeling quite hopeless. ??"

"Renal Failure","Kidney Operation","Hello EveryoneI will try to give as much information as I can but there has been alot of problems. I wil try to give the main point to what I'm trying to say.My uncle is in need of a Kidney donor operation. I put myself forward and was a match and had all the relevant tests to ensure I was healthy to go ahead with the operation. It was Scheduled for October 2014 and then cancelled 2 weeks before. My uncle and I were then sent to be assessed by a doctor, he checked things like pulse on the inside groin area. He told me I was healthy enough to go ahead with the operation but my uncle wasn't. Throughout the process all the staff I spoke to seems reluctant for me to go ahead with it. The doctor even told me they are putting my uncle back on the donor register which I was quite upset about and explained this to them. Why would they even do that when I am here, ready, waiting. Potentially stopping somebody else from receiving a kidney by pushing me off. Since then I have had little or no contact with my Kidney co-ordinator. My uncles health is deteroirating and he is becoming even more ill. I am so frustrated and upset with the way they have dealt with it all. I was 22 at the time of the operation and believe they thought I was too young. My uncle and I are very close and this would have made me so happy to have been able to do it.What I want to know is what I can do. PLEASE if anyone can help I would appreciate it so much. If he wasn't well enough for the operation then they obviously couldn't go ahead but it was only 2 weeks prior to this assessment where my uncle was assessed by another doctor who said he was healthy enough and that was when he was put on the donor register. I can't understand how within a two week period someones health could get that bad that a change like that is brought in.I ultimately thought my uncle would be given a plan of action on what he needs to do to be able to have the operation. If he wasn't well enought then does that mean he will never be able to have it? Please anyone with any advice you will be a life saver.Thanks so much for reading my mumbling message.Mike"

So I let it go.Now it's time for me to go get my thyroid checked and I am terrified they will find that I have at least Stage 2 CKD. How accurate is eGFR?

He's a builder and did have a very physical day yesterday. Would it be down to dehydration, should we try tonic water - if so how much, or vitamin E if that's ok to take. If anyone has any other suggestions I'd love to hear them. Thank you. "
"Renal Failure","GFR of 4 can it be wrong?","My friend has been given a GFR of 4 and has been put on dialysis within 2 days without any other test. He is perfectly healthy, feels fine in himself is peeing normal, isn’t fatigued... it seems something is amiss with the results. Everything I have read says he should be feeling horrible and he’s totally fine. He has been take a lot of creatine for the gym like 25g a day. He told the doctor this but they said it wouldn’t make a difference to the GFR, but I thought this was measured on the creatinine level which is the waste product of creatine? I'm obviously not a doctor but i feel something is wrong with his diagnosis. Does anyone have any advice for me or had a false GFR reading."
"Renal Failure","New ckd stage 3 diagnosis but not reason why, feeling confused?","Hi.After an NHS midlife check I had an egfr result of 59 so I have been tested over the past 6 months to see if it would improve and today the gp has now said my medical record will be marked as stage 3 ckd as all my results show between 50-59. I'm at a loss as I'm a healthy weight, exercise, never smoked, hardly drink, eat a good diet, never taken drugs or protein supplements, don't have diabetes, high blood pressure or cholesterol and have no family history. So why do I have this?? I'm now awaiting a scan of my kidneys and bladder and was told to consider going on statins. I'm just in a state of despair as I don't know why. I've had no protein or blood in my urine infact my only health concern has been insomnia but I've blamed that on 3 kids and a busy brain!! Any info or advice would be greatly received thanks x"

"Renal Failure","Currently on dialysis awaiting transplant","Hi everyone,I'm 18 years old (soon to be 19) and have been on dialysis since May ('14). I found out about my kidney disease when I was a freshman at UCSB. I am now a sophomore and am feeling a little alone when it comes to my disease.In May, I had taken some tests at the student health center because I was having horrible tests. The next day the doctor called me and insisted I go to the emergency room because the test results said I was going into kidney failure. So of course I went to the hospital and they ran a series of tests. My nephrologist came to the conclusion that I had a benign 8 centimeter tumor on one of kidneys and the other one just never fully developed. A week after that I went into surgery to have my kidney removed (left nephrectomy).I have a catheter for hemodialysis located on my chest. I'm not sure yet if I will be getting a fistula yet because I am hoping to get my transplant sooner rather than later. My mom wants to be my living donor but there are still tests that need to be done to determine if she is compatible.I sometimes just feel so alone because I know that there are not that many people my age who have kidney disease or if they do they are not as unlucky as me to have 2 bad kidneys. I even had a nurse tell me that I was the youngest patient they have had on dialysis. I have been doing extremely well during all of this considering I have been able to stay in school and what not. However, I am just wondering if there is anyone out there around my age who is going through something similar and wants someone who understands to talk to you. I have yet to find anyone in a similar situation."

"Renal Failure","I have one failed kidney . what should i do?","I am 29 years old guy and recently when i went to routine health check up i am diagnosed with right kidney non functional due to some obstruction(not kidney stone) and left kidney is perfectly normal. i never felt any symptoms like pain or any sort , checked with urologist he said that since it is non functional better to remove before it starts troubling you and nephrologist suggested that since right kidney is not fuctioning it could be from birth (he said in most cases it is from birth only) so no need to get it removed for now as there is no pain or any symptoms and if it is from birth then it is normal and if it starts troubling you , you will feel severe pain , fever , swelling and other symptoms so at that time you can get it removed. i am very confused what should i do . should i get this removed as soon as possible or wait for the symtoms ??will a non functional kidney can lead to some other problem like cancer ??what should be my pre cautions from on onwards.??Thanks in advance Vinay Kumar.

"Renal Failure","Don't know if this is the right forum but need advice please re kidney and ureter!","Hi all, sorry if this is not in the right forum. I don't know where to post it. Ok 😊 when I was 18 (22 years ago) I had a severe kidney infection whilst on holiday in Cornwall and was taken to Plymouth hospital where they did scans on my kidneys and ureters. They found that my right kidney was duplex and my right ureter had loads of kinks in it. They said they would send scans to my Dr but I had no follow up exams when I came home then I moved to a diff place and changed Drs. I had suffered UTIs on and off. 9 years ago I started getting intermittent pain in my right flank and front. I had a scan on kidneys, liver, gallbladder e.t.c which were all normal. Then six months ago I started with pain in the same area which has not gone away! Sometimes can dull to an ache. I've had another scan on kidney and bladder and blood tests all normal. My Dr then put it down to muscular so wants to treat me for that. I mentioned my kidney/ureter and she says she can find any records of my original scans! I've also had two UTIs so far this year. She was quite shocked last week she I insisted on her checking my urine and then found another infection. I have no other symptoms. I just wanted to know if anyone has had this or similar? I've read up on kinked ureters and it says it causes my symptoms'! If I had kidney disease would it show in my bloods if one kidney wasn't functioning and would I have other symptoms? Thank you so much for listening to me waffle! I'm just trying to find some answers and get out of this pain oh and btw the pain seems to go when I'm in bed and doesn't wake me. Thank you x"

This has been awful and the stress of waiting for answers all the time. Then I look on google and get the worst case senario. He was healthy, at the age of 10 a doc made a mistake. He almost died, so I am so happy he's here with me but man, this is not supposed to be his life and I am incredibly sad. I am hoping to be a match if it comes to that....He has no 100% sibling unfortunately. Any feed back I am grateful for. I have tried everything.

"Renal Failure","Kidney function 50%","I saw anephrologist on Tuesday after my dermo found blood and protein in my urine back in Janaury. He immediately took me off the fumaderm I have been on for my psoriasis but told me that my kidney function was only 50%.

I am very worried my renal function has fallen further. I am 77. Has anyone of a similar age been on drugs that affect the kidney and has renal function improved once they come of those drugs? I have go to back in 6 weeks UNLESS my blood and urine test results taken Tuesday are bad. I a m very tired and have some pains in my shoulders. Also can renal function be picked up in blood tests?

"Renal Failure","CKD low calcium what does it mean?","Hi, I have a diverse renal history. Born with renal reflux had ureters realigned in the bladder in childhood, when I was a teenager had right nephrectomy, now I'm 25. Four years ago I was sent to a nephrologist to monitor my remaining kidney. Creatinine is usually between 100-120, so not hugely elevated. My urine is always positive for blood and protein. I think they said my GFR was like in the 50s so I'm not acutely ill or in a bad way, but had my regular routine bloods last month and my calcium showed up as 1.6 (should be 2.something) consultant said my phosphorus was down also and usually in renal patients if calcium is low phosphorus is high and that things didn't match up, he put me on Desunin (cholecalciferol) vitamin D and told me to see him in 2 months whereas I usually see him yearly, but he wants to monitor it closer now... So now I'm worrying cause he was so vague that I don't know what he thinks is happening? Like at the appointment he was like going on about getting an ultrasound done that day but I had had rib pain a month before that and a&e had thought it was renal colic cause it was low down so I had had a recent ct kub which was normal so he said that was sufficient for now and to see him in January...I guess my question is, like has anyone experienced this? Does anyone have any idea what it may be showing? I can't sit around need an idea it's driving me mad!"

I have been keeping him on a moderate protein eating plan for the doctor of 74 g of protein per day, 50 ounces of fluids and because he's diabetic we are watching his moderate protein eating plan for the doctor of 74 g of protein per day, 50 ounces of fluids and because he's diabetic we are watching his carbs. We go back to the doctor in four days to see how the labs look after three weeks post to hydration . The hardest part is keeping the calories up, my husband lost 2 pounds the first week so now I have been supplementing his food with pure olive oil and other high calorie non protein carb items. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to manage this diet I have read everything I can and went to a kid in the class but have not been able to meet with the dietitian yet . My has been Great about changing his food plan however he is trying to stop smoking and his cut back. This whole situation is extremely stressful, my husband has always been in good health at the age of 77 He has been diabetic however is one Tradjenta pill per day. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed and fearful over this kidney issue, dealing with the diabetes seem to be so much easier. Any suggestions on meal planning and keeping myself calm and distressed would be great . This is the first support group that I felt people were active and many people have said with proper diet and fluid intake GFR can improve especially with time to hydrate after dehydration .Wishing you all the best of health and I hope that I will hear back from you thank you so much"

"Renal Failure","Can this be kidney failure? ","Hi guys, this is my first post and have a big concern. So apologies if this does not belong here. For the past couple of years I have had a massive problem of almost fainting during exercise, this happened 1 week ago again and I have been left exhausted since then. My limbs feel extremely weak and I am constantly tired, as if I haven't had much sleep. I was at the doctors a couple of weeks ago, due to having trouble urinating but a urine test and blood test came back normal ( well I was told no further action was required). My urine Is pretty dark and foamy every single morning but it's clear the rest of the day ( really clear!). My blood pressure seems to be on the higher side too, everytime I have been to the doctors or hospital its high! I am sure it was 167/ 80 at one point, but dipped down to 137/80 a few mins later. I was at the doctors office last week aswell and blood pressure was 130/80 and he said it was normal which I know is high. I honestly feel as if I have had the flu and feel achey all over at times. I have countless of blood tests done over the past couple of years and the only thing that came back was low calcium and my kidney function was slightly below normal, but came back up the following blood test. Was a slight amount of urea in my blood. This is when all the problems started tbh. I don't know what to do now as the past few blood tests I have had (standard NHS tests) most of came back normal. Would something like a kidney problem show up on a standard test? Due to being with the NHS you can't request further testing unless there is something wrong, although I have been put forward for further investigations, but who knows when that will happen. I should note I am on the heavy side, 106kg (233lbs) but I do powerlifting and have a lot of muscle on my frame. Don't take steroids or anything illegal. I am just stuck on what to do now! Apologies if this is in the wrong forum. Any advice would be much appreciated though. "

Over the last few months i have noticed feeling ""not with it"" almost ""a drunk"" feeling. My head at times seems to be cloudy, its hard to explain. I guess this is part of the kidney issue.

"Renal Failure","CKD and Dialysis","Just curious as to why there is no forum on dialysis when there are so many people with End Stage KIdney Disease (ESRD/CKD4). I'm in the US where our medical lingo and acronyms are considerably different from the UK, so forgive me if I don't get it right. Home dialysis methods and machines are rapidly being perfected but information about ESRD/CKD4 is not keeping pace. Furthermore, at least in the US, the companies that run the clinics and manufacture the machines and supplies are very reluctant to divulge information and hide behind the "" patiet's confidentialitiy"" rules to avoid giving information. I'm referring to corporations like Fresenius and Baxter and Davita. The end result is a tradgic lack of vital information.For example, every time I ask questions about the performance of my Fresenius cycler, the answer I get is always the same: ""Everybody is different so I/we can't answer that."""

"Renal Failure","CKD3b and Hypertension","Is there by chance anyone looking in who has only one kidney which is low functioning (CKD3b) and who has high blood pressure and being treated with BP medication?My eGFR is 40 at present, and deteriorating faster due probably to a mixture of the very high blood pressure and the various BP medications I have been trialled on over the last 2 years. The BP pills that are generally thought to be helpful to the kidneys have produced such unwanted side effects that I am now being put on pills that seem to be making my kidney function reduce at a faster rate, plus they are not reducing my blood pressure.I'm really keen to find someone else who might also have one kidney, high blood pressure and CKD, who is taking a blood pressure medication which is keeping their kidney function stable rather than causing it to reduce further.My present pills are Losartan Potassium 50mg and Bisoprolol 1.25.

Noticed the other day my urine was dark orange - doc said there was protein in urine and after tests there are no infections. I have mild ache in back which could be muscular but feel awful. The nausea is rotten and taste in mouth worse. Doc said not related to protein in urine but not convinced. Doubled lansoprazole to 30mg twice daily but only helped slightly.

"Renal Failure","Resisting Dialysis","my mother is 73 she has no other health issues, but she use to smoke and take bex powders (mixed annalgesics) many years ago. she was diagnosed with kidney cancer 12 years ago, and the offending kidney was removed, at that time her kidney function was 20 %, the decline continued and 2 years ago she went down to 6% function, she has maintained 6% function for 2 years, she is resisting dialysis, although i spoke to her specialist he was reluctant to tell me how long my mother can maintaiin 6% function, and what he likely otcome would be, so can some please shed some light on to my mother's potential outcome ? thank you."

"Renal Failure","CKD Stage 3 drop suddenly to stage 4","Hello, My wife has diagonysis CKD stage 3 last May during her Viral Meningities infection. since then she is under BP medication and very stable eGFR, around 30-35%.Dec 2014, about 7=8 weeks back, doctor has increased here BP medicise from 150mg to 300mg, although her BP is very stable between 110-120/ 65-75. 2 weeks back we have seen (1st blood test after BP medicine increase) her eGFR fall down to 22% from 35%.

Or the further damage may caused by BP medicine is parmanently put heer down to 22%?"

"Renal Failure","Life after diagnosis","I just wonder how other partners / patients have got on.My wife was diagnosed with 4th Stage kidney failure just over 2 years or so ago and is now on peritoneal dialysis. She seems to be coping well but has lost a lot of weight (nothing new very common). Two large side effects of her kidney failure is:-1. Prolapsed womb most likely coupled to the weight loss and GP is aware I have nagged her once or twice to keep an eye on it and don't leave it. I don't think she needs anymore complications but I DO UNDERSTAND SHE DOESN'T WANT DOCTORS POKING AROUND ANYMORE THAN NEEDS BE EITHER!2. Complete loss of libido! this isn't just my issue! She's well aware and was concerned enough a while ago for us to have a heart to heart. One nurse actually broached the subject sadly she's moved on before we could discuss it. Yes we do not now have sex and sometimes a quick peck is pushing it!luckily we didn't build our relationship on sex originally and our bond is stronger than that. However she did suggest of meeting other people as long as she wasn't aware! It isn't the way I would like to go of course. This side effect is a tough one and I think I need to go back and have a heart to heart with the GP and see what she says. "

What would my efgr rate be if doctors want me to do another blood test in only 4 weeks. Hopefully it will help me put my.mind at ease in 2 weeks.

Her water tablets were increased a couple weeks ago, but has not made any difference.

"Renal Failure","Mother 59, CKD patient - BUN 71, Creatinine 1.41. Need help deciding recourse.","My 59 year old mom has been suffering from CKD since mid 2012. She had tuberculosis in 1996 and some of it was left untreated which resulted as fibrosis. The left lung was completely damaged. The heart and kidneys were affected too. Doctor says this CKD is a primary to secondary disease. We tried Spiromide when she used to have swelling and water retention in early 2013 and then took her to the hospital. They gave her Lasix and some other medications too. Unfortunately her creatinine was rising to 1.6 at that time due to the medicines and she became mentally confused and also dehydrated. We started herbal alternative consisting of select food only in mid 2013 and gave a her a very limited diet which resulted in her being very weak like a bag of bones and low RBC. Shes in a wheelchair now. Then in early 2014 we started homeopathic treatment. The homeopathic medicines completely eliminated the water retention and the swelling from her legs and beneath eyes. They also resulted in fluctuating creatinine and urea values. Creatinine was for the most part controlled between 1.6 (rarley) to 1.5(commonly) and 1.41 (It is Current value - new low since started homeopathic) But the problem is BUN currently at 71.04 which means Urea is 152 using Urea [mg/dL]= BUN [mg/dL] x 2.14. She is also a diabetic. In previous reports of the heart, Triglycerides have been very high. No dialysis started yet. RBC count is usually low. So is hemoglobin. But does sometimes imrpove. BP normally 140/60.She mostly talks normally with short breaths. But today I talked to her on the phone and my heart broke because she said in a very tired voice and running out of breath that ""I don't think I'm going to get any better. I dont think Im getting better"" It was the sudden end of my world. I don't know what else to include here. I cannot type any further as the tears in my eyes have blurred my vision. If you need any mroe calrificaiton or details, please let me know. I have all test values since 2012 documented along with diets and everything else."

"Renal Failure","BP pills for high blood pressure are worsening my CKD","Just had results of latest blood tests today following the introduction of an additional pill for my high blood pressure 3 weeks ago. Three of the tests on the blood have come back reading even more abnormal than the test done 3 months ago. My sodium levels have reduced from normal, urea and creatinine have increased to a higher ""abnorma"" and my eGFR kidney function has reduced from 47 to 39 in just 3 weeks on the additional pill - a diuretic called Indapamide. Needless to say that will be stopped from tomorrow, and I'm so glad as I've been feeling more and more fatigued and finding it difficult to put one leg in front of the other, apparently due to my reduced sodium levels. Just crossing everything that things will improve after stopping these pills. The whole reason for trying to get my high blood pressure down was to stop the pressure from aggravating my sole kidney function - unfortunately all the medication I've tried has had the opposite effect and whereas my kidney function was originally low but stable, it is now further deteriorating.Just crossing everything that things will improve after stopping this latest pill.....better still that a magic forumla can be found for high blood pressure!

I just never gave it a second thought, but during the day I began to wonder why.Having returned my sample at evening surgery I asked his wife why I had been asked to give a sample. She replied its because you have CKD!What? since when I cried and what is it?She then went on to tell me I had had it since March of this year. Why wasn't I told about this CKD, she just looked at me and said you'll have to ask Doctor.I was flabbergasted to say the least, I have since looked it up on the net and to my relief its not as bad as I feared, but I can't understand why I wasn't told I had it in the first place!Is this serious remiss on my GP's part or what?"
