Cataract,IOL Exchange - let's get serious,"Hi,I've been trying to deal with positive dysphotopsia for the last 2 years, but I'm done. It's too much, I can't stand it any longer.Tecnis monofocal.Pilocarpine is killing me, it's so painfull and uncomfortable, it's not a solution at all.What is your opinion about IOL exchage?On one hand, removing the IOL which provides 25/20 seems like madness. On the other hand, not removing it sounds like madness too.Moreover, there's no IOL on the market that guarantees any improvement.Is there anyone in such trouble?"
Cataract,Any positive thing about catarct surgery ?,"Helloi am 32 years old and I want to do cataract surgery with tecnis synergy but in this forum there is only negative experiences I would like to know if after the surgery i will see better or worse than i am nowhow can i seeafter surgery my smartphone ,TV , drivibg ,read a book , PC ... ?"
Cataract,Negative dysphotopsia ,"I have the classic black arc in the left side of my left eye post op. Id be interested in the experience of others. How long did it take to go away, did it go away? Its extremely annoying at this point."
Cataract,Symfony Plus has Received FDA Approval. ,this is a symfony with a near add or perhaps a trifocal. Shannon Wong just mentioned it on Youtube and it is also listed on FDA approval as of 5/1.this lens was also mentioned to me by dr. safran from new jersey. but that was a couple of months before the panoptix was approved.
Cataract,IOL Lens Half in the Bag,"It's been 3 months since my cataract surgery for my left eye. Visual acuity is excellent however the biggest problem I have had is a maddox-rod effect. So when I'm driving, every headlight and streetlight has a single long streak of light through it at the same angle. I have edge glare as well but this doesn't bother me as much and I can resolve this by wearing anti-glare glasses.I was slated for an acrylic toric iol but for some reason the surgeon upgraded me without my knowledge or consent to a Trulign lens. I talk about this in a discussion I created here:https://patient.info/forums/discuss/opinions-on-cataract-surgeon-experience-729137?page=0#3674068I finally was able to have a 2nd opinion yesterday and I found out that the iol is only half in the bag and because of this is slightly at an angle ( the left edge farthest from nose sticks forward a bit more than the edge closest to nose). I believe this is why I have the maddow-rod effect and probably the edge glare as well. This 2nd doctor recommended that I do nothing surgically since he believes my eyes are very complicated. In that left eye I used to wear -10 spherical, -3.5 cylidrical, I've had scleral buckles from a retinal detachment in my 20s, and I've recently had a vitrectomy in that eye. The first surgeon did happen to mention that the components in the front of my eye were ""loose"" (zonules?) although he never bothered to tell me that the lens was only half in the bag.The 2nd doctor mentioned that my vision is impressively good now compared to where it was. He said the only things that could go wrong are the typical PCO (which he can see a little building up) and the possibility that when the bag tightens up after a complete healing that it may squeeze the lens causing it to get unaligned even more since half the lens is out of the bag.Otherwise the 2nd doctor said I should leave it alone because the risks of worse complications are greater by trying to surgically exchange it or adjust it. I guess due to my eye history and that I may have weak zonules. Since that eye was adjusted for intermediate vision he gave me a prescription for driving glasses which brings the left eye up to 20/20 for distance saying that this should make the maddox-rod effects less noticeable since the lights will be in a tighter focus.I've wondered if the 1st doctor used an acrylic toric like we agreed that this wouldn't have happened. But perhaps it would have. I can't change the past since what's done is done and it doesn't look like I have the option of having a lens exchange or even a surgical adjustment.I've read that a Yag laser can fix some maddow-rod effects but that seems to be for wrinkled capsular bags where I may have a different issue. The 2nd doctor said he wouldn't want to even consider a Yag laser for the PCO until a year from now because of my situation. Do you think the Yag laser could actually help reduce the maddox-rod effect in my case?Has anybody else had a misaligned or half-in-the-bag iol? And if so, how did things work out?I guess I should be happy that I do have pretty good vision in that left eye that's been through so much. I can tolerate some imperfections like the edge glare but I'm worried that the maddox rod effect may prevent me from doing night driving."
Cataract,Cataract surgery,"Just had cataract surgery, during it the surgeon said the lens was very dense for someone my age, what does that mean"
Cataract,Is it tecnis symfony worth it ?,i have to chose fot tecnis symfony or mono focal tecnis eyhance is it tecnis symfony wort it i read that we can't see in night with it ?
Cataract,Choose EDOF or monovision with monofocal?,"Hello, I had a monofocal IOL (Tecnis) implanted in my right eye due to cataract in 2015. I was only 40 then. The doctor said my cataract may be caused by high myopia (-7D) or previous PRK operation. At that time, doctor chose to set my right eye to intermediate vision as I work in front of computer most of the time. I can see clearly from 50 to 70cm by right eye now and don't need a glasses for most of the activities. Need reading glasses for prolonged reading.My left eye is getting worse. It sees spiderweb like image to bright light sources (traffic light, street light, break light, etc) day and night. With left eye alone, I can't tell the outline of a car 10 meters away from dusk. All I see are light patterns crossing each other. But with right eye's assist, I can see the cars and the original position of light sources, so I have no problem driving at night. ( I have driven 60km one way on 401/QEW and locals every work day for two winters in Toronto)I'm seeing doctors to have my left eye implanted, as it barely sees anything. But three doctors all said my only choice is another Tecnis monofocal with monovision, because both eyes have to use the same type of lens. But on internet, many surgeon are practising mixed IOL implantation. Are doctors in Toronto too conservative?Based on studies I did recently, I think EDOF may be a good candidate for my left eye targeting to distance vision. Then there will be no blurry area between distance and intermediate by using monovision. It can also tolerate the calculation error considering the difficulty with post-PRK eye.I understand EDOF may have higher chance of visual effects. However, my left eye now has much worse effects by cataract and I'm living with it. I think I should be able to EDOF.Should I insist using Symfony in my left eye? Or should I wait longer for newer lens available in Canada like Tecnis Eyhance monofocal?"
Cataract,Cataract Surgery - Below Age 40 - Best IOL Choice?,"All,I wanted to start a thread dedicated to discussion about IOL selection for individuals below age 40. I'm curious if anyone who meets this criteria can comment about what specific IOL they selected and how the results were?A little about me - I just turned 30 and currently trying to decide which IOL to go with in my dominant right eye. I'm leaning towards a monofocal IOL set for near/intermediate (I use my phone & computer almost all day). I'm curious if anyone around this age range has implanted a monofocal lens set for near/intermediate with excellent results? I'm worried about losing my natural accommodation and also having to potentially deal with edge glare due to larger pupils at age 30.The lens I'm considering is the B&L LI61AO Sofport. It's a 6mm aspheric monofocal IOL made of silicone material (less prone to glare compared to acrylic) and it has square edges to prevent PCO."
Cataract,Had cataract surgery yesterday. Can I still have a cataract?,"When I stare at a word in the newspaper, the word and all around it, totally disappears. Isn't that exactly what a cataract does? I had surgery yesterday!!And I use only one eye, so it wouldn't be from a cataract on the blind eye."
Cataract,"Some Good News on COVID-19 - Alberta, Canada","It was just announced that some elective surgeries including cataract surgeries will be allowed to resume on Monday, May 4. This comes after a 2 month or so suspension. So, perhaps my surgery will be in October, instead of the originally estimated August..."
Cataract,Tecnis Synergy,"Hello all - if anyone has any experience using the Tecnis Synergy IOLs, please share your views. Thanks!"
Cataract,Need help deciding type of lens,"In September of 2019 i had surgery to remove an epiretinal membrane in my right eye. One side effect of this surgery is that you will develop a cataract in that eye within 2 years. My vision in that eye is blurry. Today i saw a doctor to see if a new eyeglass prescription would help. It wouldn't. He said my vision problem was due to a cataract, although its not too bad at this point. Since its inevitable, and only going to get worse, I think I'm going to get it done as soon as possible. I have an appointment with the cataract surgeon next month. The doctor i saw today said i will probably be given the option of getting a lens that will correct my nearsightedness, which ive had since i was a kid, or a plain lens, which would leave me nearsighted as i am now. In either case, i would need glasses for reading. The idea of clear vision is appealing, but i would still need glasses because of my left eye. Id end up with a prescription lens for my left eye, and a plain lens for my right. I currently have progressive lenses, although i usually take my glasses off when i read. If i get the corrective lens to replace the cataract, I would need a stronger correction in order to read with that eye. This would leave me with glasses with 2 wildly different prescriptions, both for distance and for reading. On the other hand, i do have a slight cataract in my ""good"" eye, so could conceivably get a lens to correct my distance vision at some point.Of course i will discuss this with the cataract surgeon when i meet with him, but i'd like to go in there with as much information as possible. Any advice?"
Cataract,Experience Glare with Monofocal Acrysoft IQ toric,"Hi everybody,Last Monday I got my first IOL implant in my left eye. I opted for the monofocal in order to have n side effect.At the beginning no problem, or better I just have my pupil very constricted due the stress of the surgery. My visual acuity was pretty good, but starting from yesterday night that my pupil goes back on its normal condition now I'm experiencing some glare even with the day light.I would like to ask if this can be considered normal at this stage or not; my worry is that the lens is now out of position.Yesterday I have been at the Hospital for the routine check and the Dr. put the dilatation drops in my eye and everything was fine, no glare, but after that the pupil goes back on its normal position (no more constricted) I got the glare.Does anyone had some similar experience? Next Monday I will have the right eye surgery, in that case this could be a good chance to fix the lens in case.....Sorry for my english if it is not perfect.thank you so much."
Cataract,Surgery - Both Eyes at Once,"Hello to all,Am very new to cataracts, so please bear with me...I'm 45 and recently diagnosed with pretty advanced cataracts in both eyes. I wondered why my vision had been getting so bad!Because of various factors I'm having the surgery done privately - and the surgeon has said he sees no danger in doing both eyes on the same day. I've read a few pros and cons for this approach, so wondering if anyone here has experienced this?Thanks in advance,Jack"
Cataract,Help me choose a monofocal IOL,"Some of you may have helped me previously here:Dr's recommending EDoF/MF IOL.I'm not yet convinced,I'm still waiting for elective surgeries to be rescheduled due to COVID-19. In the meantime I've settled on monofocal IOLs for distance, or possibly mini-mono vision. I've ruled out Acrysof lenses because of their propensity to develop glistenings. I'm aware that it hasn't been conclusively proven that glistenings affect vision, but why take the chance. Additionally, it has been shown that glistenings hinder an ophthalmologist view into the eye. So there's that. As I'm in the US, my choices are somewhat limited, and it seems the best options are the Tecnis ZC800 and the Bausch & Lomb enVista MX60E. I have my own pros and cons list for theses lenses, but I'm interested in other patients experiences and/or perspectives on these two IOLs, or any others you think I should consider. Thank you!"
Cataract,Please share PCO/YAG experience,
Cataract,Why isn’t anyone talking about Technis Eyhance?,looks like technis eyhance is awesome. it is giving good intermediate with no rings and glare and halo. the diopter transition seems smooth. why isnt anyone going gaga over it?it will also have no glare for folks with large pupils. being technis its will also make its way to US/CANADA.
Cataract,Eye exercises after cataract surgery,"How long should I wait after cataract surgery, before doing eye exercises (involving eye movements to all directions)ThanksRoni"
Cataract,Blurred vision months after cataract surgery,"I am devastated. I had cataract surgery on 9/11/15, and around December I started to have blurred vision. It is now June 1, 2016, and it starts every time I look at my phone, computer, or even read a magazine. I got computer glasses, and they enlarge the words, but when I put my regular glasses on everything is blurred. No really the large things, but everything I read, etc. I knew I would wear glasses, so that is not my problem. No eye diseases, have seen the surgeon and another neuro opthamologist. No one seems worried, or to take me seriously. I work a 40 hour job that I love, but as soon as I turn on my computer at work, there goes the blurred vision. It lasts all day and does not go away until about 2 hours after I get home. There is a problem, but no one seems to know what it is. They said the lens are in place, etc., and all looks good. It is not. Has this ever happened to anyone else? Before my surgery, I had worked for 12 years on the same computer I have now, and loved to read. I can't even read our newspaper, as my vision blurrs up. Also, on the TV Guide, after I get home from work and still have the blurred vision, the guide shows like a ghost shadow on the bottom of the words on the guide! Help!!!"
Cataract,Did anyone here do mini-monovision? ,Are you happy? Any input?
Cataract,Refractive Lens Replacement with Symphony Lens,"Recently I had a Refractive Lens Replacement in both eyes and the doctor used the Symfony Lens. I am seeing at minimum of 10 rings around the street lights and brake lights at night The outside corners of my eyes feel like I have a tear drop in them and the center of my bottom eyelids feel like they are welling up. I keep telling the doctor that I feel like I have just come up from the swimming pool with my eyes open and there is a glaze over my eyes. Has anyone had this type of experience? I'm 49 years young with a 3, 4 and 6 year old and I don't fee like going through life with these types of problems already. My surgery was 3 months ago and not a lot has changed since. I'm trying to figure out what is going on. I wish I never had this damn surgery and just stuck with my contacts. I only had the surgery so I didn't have to wear readers all the time, and now I wish having to wear readers was my only problem. Please let me know your thoughts as I am searching hard for an answer.Recently I had a Refractive Lens Replacement in both eyes and the doctor used the Symfony Lens.

Cataract,Arc flashes? Floater dot? Dystophobia? One month after cataract surgery,"one month after uneventful right eye cataract surgery (monofocal toric technis ll lenses) stated seeing for the first time bright arc like flashes in outer corner of right eye. comes and goes..not throughout the whole day. just here and there. seem to notice when leaving brightly lit room, then going into dark room. Few of those arc bright flashes same area. They are very brief. I've had for like 2 days a single black dot floater. Had floaters before cataract surgery. But just started to see this one teensy black dot floater. vision is the same.But of course I'm worried and concerned. Even.more so I'm avoiding going anywhere. Been staying home except for that one month ago right eye cataract surgery and the following week (3 weeks ago left eye (same lens type) Trying to do research on this but finding conflicting info. No flashes when eyes closed.is this all dysphotopsia? retinal tear? vitreous detachment?..or do I just need to monitor over a few days. These arc corner right eye random flashes only started today. Dot floater maybe 2 days ago and randomly also. (Im.65y.o)"
Cataract,What is a Posterior Capsule Rupture?,I got silicone oil in my eye and will be having cataract surgery. I got a 10% chance of having a Posterior Capsule Rupture. What is is? How will my vision be if I get it? Google has no answers!
Cataract,Growing up with congenital cataracts ,"Hi there,I'm 22 years old and I was diagnosed with bilateral congenital cataracts when I was a six week old baby. I had the cataracts removed when I was eight and ten weeks old, and I started wearing thick lensed glasses when I was three months old. My parents opted for glasses as they did not want me going through lens procedures every few months and did not want to struggle with contact lenses (after they saw another child screaming with the pain of them). I went though patching to balance my eyes up until I was six.I've never received support from the blind council here as I was on the list for corrective surgery and I attended mainstream school (despite the protests of the principal). I received support in primary school with PE to improve my coordination and resource teaching to improve my social and visual skills. When I was sixteen, I opted for IOL surgery which corrected my vision significantly. I now only use reading glasses day to day.Sometimes I feel my condition is isolating. Everyone assumes that it only occurs in elderly people and people look in amazement when I say that I had it, or they need it explained to them. I've never met anybody around my own age who has been through the same experience. I attended the children's eye clinic but a lot of patients attending that were either born with Down's Syndrome or another disability or were up for a procedural check up as they were born premature.I don't consider myself to be disabled, I prefer the term impaired.It's hard to explain to people the way that I need to have things bigger for myself, then explaining that no, I'm not blind, no, I'm not low vision as I've had corrective surgery but yes, I am dealing with the side effects of cataracts. It was particularly bad before I had the corrective surgery, as not many teachers and no students at the mainstream schools I attended understood what was different about me besides me wearing glasses. One time I literally had to beg a teacher to change the seating plan so I could sit at the front to see the board properly and stop me getting headaches. It was a battle to get exam supports in secondary school. Thank God my university is a lot more accomodating. I've really struggled socially, not helped by my Asperger's (which I only found out about when I was nineteen) or years of bullying because of my eyesight.Yes, I know cataracts is a common condition among elderly people. It's surreal at the moment as my aunt is waiting for her cataracts to 'bloom' so she can have surgery (Been there, done that!). I'm also the youngest patient attending the adult eye clinic so anyone who talks to me and my mam think that she has it!If anyone else out there is around my age, I'd love to hear your stories. I've never found any kind of online support for children who have grown up with cataracts, it's only geared toward elderly adults. If there is a corner of the internet we could congregate, I'd like to contribute.Thanks for reading x"
Cataract,"24 years old, cataract in both eyes , edof or monovision","hello i am 24 years old and have cataracts in both eyes which I have to get removed.I feel so bad that I have to give away my healhty eye function at such young age. I feel so bad about it , I need hope that it wont be a problem in my everyday life..I've read so much about different IOLs, the doc said he would personally recommend me EDOFS with a mini monovision because of my young ageBut because I said glares and halos would be a big problem for me, because I love driving at night and I wouldn't wanna give away my ability to drive.Now we will do Monovision with Monofocals , because there is the lowest risk to losing ability to see at light and glares.but then I've read that monovision takes away stereo vision, and that would be very very bad.also I have read it's dangerous to drive like that.it's so hard..basically the most important thing to me is that I wont feel like that I'm disabled or something for the rest of my life.Its important for me to see faces clear infront of me. I'm afraid I would from now on always see faces blurry with the monofocals set for distance / or monovision.I dont want blur if i kiss my girlfriend or wake up next to her.i want to be able to drive at night without problems, also being able to drive with good stereovision.A big hobby of mine is cars, and I absolutely love driving my car at its limits on country roads.Also I do Kickboxing and BJJ, I'm afraid I wont see my partner infront of me sharp anymore.I still want to be able to read my texts, or change a song in the car.My idea would have been to take the monofocals and then use multifocal contacts, I couldnt find anything to this combo in the internet.I have no experience with multifocal contacts, I cant imagine how they would work, in my imagination I would think that they would be just like if I had multifocal IOLs, the doc said it wouldnt be as sharp as a an implanted lense tho.I've read that it takes some time to get used to them, I thought I could maybe wear them always except when I'm driving at night and that this would be the best way to have a clear image on all distances.also I dont care about crystal clear vision, it should just seem natural to see all distancesI really would be fine to see up to 20 meters and use glasses only for driving.I would have no problems to wear driving glasses.I'm so lost, I hate this decision.I hope somebody can help me.."
Cataract,Mini Mono vision for near intermediate,"HiI am 53, have just done ( 3 days ago) my second cataract surgery to my left eye.The right eye was done about a week earlier.currently the results are :Right eye : -2.25 DLeft eye : -1.5 DMy dominant eye is the right eye.Its very comfortable to read with my right dominant eye - i am not feeling the blur in the second eye.However, when reading the comp or looking more distant, using my non dominant eye, especially at low light condition, I do see the blur from my right eye. Is it just a matter of time to adapt to this ?"
Cataract,3 months post IOL Multifocal lens implantation - suicidal,"heyjust turned 25, i posted here before when I was a few days post opi have one lens implanted in my eye. it resulted in blurry far vision and a horrible shakingthe shaking goes away if you fully relax your eyes, but my eyes deviate, double vision. the doctors explanation is that i am compensating for the diopter difference. but still, because the shaking never 100% goes away, its constant flickering and shaking. every second i feel this horrible urge, like this is all a dream. like ""okay, we can go back to real life now"" then im just here, in my cold dead body. i wander around just tortured by the IOL. i feel it shake inside my head.the shaking happens whenever the eye is moving and focused. so reading is the worst. ive stopped reading books since, i just lay in bed all day. my girlfriend and i broke up. i just want it to stopthe doctor suggested contacts and does not want to perform on the other eye until we've cleared the issue (which he is taking his sweet time in, after I payed $4000). he perscribed a prescription that doesn't exist. im kind of done at this point. i move to another doctor for his opinion. he gives me an opposite opinion: get another IOL in the other eye.I can not stand the IOL. it shakes, it flickers. the floaters are ridiculous, it's not just ""annoying"" there are four layers of all-across-vision floaters and strands that are constantly in the way of seeing. I do not want these effects duplicated on the other eye. I would rather have them legally blind me in the IOL eye. I don't know what to do. every operation risks making worse a condition that i have called Visual Snow. It's purely neurological but has me seeing static in front of my eyes. Doctors do not even know about this condition.I've decided that if I can not solve this issue soon, I will leave the Earth."

Cataract,Seeking feedback on EDoF lenses vis-a-vis monofocal (Eyhence),"I am planning for a cataract surgery on both eyes soon.May I hear users’ valuable first-hand experience with (i) EDoF & (ii) monofocal (Eyhence in particular) lenses regarding night vision effects (starbursts, halos, glares...) for an understanding of the extent of the issues that I’ll have to face?Thank you folks."
Cataract,"UPDATED: Dr's recommending EDoF/MF IOL I'm not yet convinced,","So Dr. 4's office closed on Friday 3/20 due to the COVID19 crisis, unfortunately my appointment was on the same day, and next available dates are in mid-May. In the meantime, Dr. 3 (Head of Ophthalmology at Kaiser) has scheduled my surgery for May 12th. We've settled on monofocal IOLs (Tecnis) set for distance in both eyes. At this point I'm hoping the dates hold and am moving forward with this plan. I have a couple of questions for Dr. 3 when I go in for pre-surgery on April 14th:As mentioned before, when I asked him what refractive target he would shoot for he said Plano, so little concerned that if we overshoot I'll be farsighted. Perhaps he target's something less than 0.0 as his standard to get to plano, but would like a little more assurance I won't end up +0.5.It appears I don't have enough astigmatism to go with toric IOLs. Dr. said when he plugged my numbers into the Tecnis toric calculator it came back with .61 residual astigmatism and recommended the regular Tecnis monofocal. We already discussed LRI and he did not recommend. So need to discuss what options I have to address the residual astigmatism if it prevents me from getting a good result. If anyone has experience with this or good research material I would be most grateful!Kaiser has largely switched to a simultaneous bi-lateral cataract surgery model (both eyes same day). In general I prefer the more conservative/traditional sequential approach, but at this point I kind of just want to get it over with, and am concerned about getting stuck with one eye done if things in the world get worse. Any thoughts?I know people have bigger problems right now, so hope you won't mind me winging on. Hope you are all safe and healthy."
Cataract,EXPERIENCE OF YAG SURGERY AND SUBSEQUENT LASER TO CORRECT VISION ,"HI I has cataract surgery 3 months ago but now need YAG procedure followed with laser to correct the followingunfortunately, i have not attained 20/20 vision so will require laser surgery afterwardsMy question is that since day 1 i have felt that the affected eye feels bulky and visibly i can see the eye lid looks slightly swollen- could any of the above be due to the lens not sitting properly in the eye?I have to make some tough decisions in the coming weeks so ant experience you can share would be gratefully received.Due to coronavirus, i have a few extra weeks to think about the pros and cons of what i am facing with..Thanks in advance"
Cataract,Expected to learn I have PCO developing in my left eye but found out it’s Epiretinal Membrane.,For months I experienced slight blurry vision at all distances and thought I was experiencing PCO or increased astigmatism. My cataract surgeries were July and Aug 2017. Saw my optometrist today and neither is cause for my blurry vision in left eye - I have Epiretinal Membrane. I am being referred to a retina specialist. Not sure how long that will take but my optometrist made the referral. My eyesight is 20/30 out of that eye - cannot be corrected. My optometrist says this condition is mild in my case and can corrected itself in time for some people. Googling this condition wasn't advised as bad cases of it can lead to tears and holes in macula so not sure it is a good idea to look into this online.I really was glad to hear my lenses are good and I don't have pco but didn't expect to hear this either. Anyone else experience this and what was your outcome? Did it require treatment or go away on it's own?Thanks everyone.
Cataract,Upcoming Surgery for Congenital Cataracts at 36,"Hi all,I've been a lurker for a few weeks, but wanted to start my own thread as a place to share my experience with cataracts, especially as I was diagnosed young and will be having cataract surgery at a young age.I was first diagnosed with congenital cataracts at age 5, and have had them ever since. They've always been fairly mild - for a long time my vision was 20/30-20/35, about the same acuity for near, intermediate and distance. I also have a slight astigmatism and a slight lazy eye (acuity based, not misalignment based). I’ve been prescribed glasses for the astigmatism in the past, but the correction was so mild I never used them because they didn’t really “fix anything” (the astigmatism sure, but not the cataracts).I moved to Boston when I was 29 and found a new ophthalmologist. She recognized my cataracts right away (she is a cataract specialist), and said I’d likely need surgery someday but better to hold off until it was needed. Starting this summer (I’m now 35), I started to notice lots of glare and halos from light - I was commuting to work on the subway one day and realized the lights in the subway station seemed awfully hazy, but it wasn’t a very humid day. After a few days of anxious waiting, I scheduled a check-in with my ophthalmologist and she confirmed my cataracts were getting worse and based on how my vision was deteriorating, I’d likely need surgery within a year.She gave me the option of scheduling the surgery now, or scheduling a check in in six months time to see where I was at. Went home and talked it over with my wife, and then called my father, who had cataract surgery in his late 50s, and my dad put it to me this way - He said “it’s the best thing I ever did for my vision. I saw better the day after my surgery then I had seen in years before that. If I was you, I wouldn’t put off something you’re going to have to do eventually anyways. Why keep putting up with bad vision when you could get it over with? “So after a few days of consideration, I emailed my ophthalmologist and said let’s get this train started. I started doing research on lens choices and what went into the surgery. I went in last week for my A scan and a consult with the doc on lens choices. Since I’ve never really worn glasses, and I’m not particularly far or nearsighted, it’s definitely a bit of tossup in terms of which direction to go. My ophthalmologist definitely seems conservative about the side effects of some of the premium lenses, and has talked up monofocal’s, but she also hasn’t talked me out of any of the premium lenses either. In fact after talking about my lifestyle, the fact that my wife and I are very active (run 2-3 days a week, lift weights 3-4 days a week, hike in the summer on weekends, snowboard in the winter, etc.) she suggested considering the new PanOptix trifocals, or the older ReSTOR multifocals. She had just met the Alcan rep that week about the PanOptix and said given their popularity in Europe and Canada, they may be a good fit.So at this stage, I need to go back for more eye measurements in three weeks (immersion, and a few others) as I apparently have a “short eye” and she wants to nail the refraction calculations. I’m leaning heavily towards the PanOptix as my first choice, then the Symfony as my second, before considering a few others if there’s some reason those are not a good fit. We may or may not go Toric on he lenses depending on the measurements on my astigmatism.My hope is, given that I’m on the younger side of the average cataract patient, that I’ll take pretty well to any choice that I make in terms of new lenses. I’ve never thought of my vision is being that bad until just recently, now that I’m getting lots of glare at night and in dark situations and from bright lights even during the daytime. I am trying to be pragmatic, especially given the slight astigmatism and lazy eye, that I might need glasses or contacts for some distances after I’m done. But my surgery will be at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear hospital, which is very good, and my ophthalmologist does a few hundred cataract surgeries a year, so I’m feeling hopeful about my odds.Currently my first surgery is scheduled for Nov 18 (a few days before my 36th birthday), so I’m hoping my doc can deliver me a good birthday present. We’ll need to finalize my lens choice and which eye goes first, but we’ll get that started in the weeks ahead.I’ll provide updates as I go along as I haven’t found too many stories like mine about quite young patients with congenital cataracts, and I’d like to document my experience a bit for anyone who might come looking for a similar story."
Cataract,Two EDoF lenses - do night time issues get better or worse when second lens put in? ,"I thought i read it gets better, as brain can more easily adjust to eyes working the same way. But read from someone on here that Dr said artefacts would intensify?Perhaps they intensify in short term but then adaptation speeds up.For those of you with 2 EDOFs, I'd be interested to hear experiencesThanks"
Cataract,Symfony Toric IOL ZXT and halos,"I'm mid 40s about to have a cataract removed and Symfony Toric extended depth of focus (EDOF) inter ocular lens (IOL), the ZXT series I believe. I have mild astigmatism and a mild prescription for long sightedness. Surgery will be done privately in Reading, Berks UK.This lens sounds like it will improve my astigmatism and give me good mid and distance, but I may need reading glasses. My only worry is the halos and starbursts. At the moment my cataract explode headlights into a scattergun of light larger than the size of the car, and that makes driving near impossible at night. I assume these halos and starbursts are not that bad?Has anyone had this lens inserted for a few months/years, and how bad are these visual artefacts at night? Can anyone draw what they see or maybe link to a visual representation online?Eventually the other eye will need doing, but the cataract in that one isn't too bad yet.ThanksJames"
Cataract, Preliminary Update on Stage one of Mini Mono-Vision Surgery this week,"Hi All,.Thought I'd better provide an update post surgery on my cataract removal and IOL implant which occurred Tuesday this week!.Good News First.Procedure seemed to go well without any obvious issues. Glowing reports from Dr Genial and Dr Knockout (Anaesthetist) who seemed to be the Director/Conductor of proceedings leaving Dr G to concentrate on the procedure and the Phaco machine etc! ?.No irritation, inflammation (edema) or infection etc. that is symptomatic. Taking 4 kinds of eye drops to guard against these issues..Visual perception is Bright, Really Bright and colours are Vivid! And can clearly see large objects and shapes etc! Guess that's what happens when one substitutes a Beer Bottle coloured lens for a clear one! ?.Not so Good NewsNear visual acuity is not great. Best I can do is N11/ N10 on a Jaeger chart and it's still not clear over an arms length! Type/characters seem have a shivering jagged edge to them and not solid, especially when compared to my other cataract eye (corrected) which I can still read the smallest N1/N2 text!.Not sure why this is as we seem to have hit the MMV target of around -1.75D according to my surgeon Dr G which should give me better intermediate to near Visual Acuity (VA)! ?.Spoke to him yesterday re the VA issues and he said to come in for an OCT macular scan on Monday! ?.So that's where I am four days after surgery. I know it's only early days, and I still hope and expect things will improve with the 'new' eye in the coming days. I just hope there's nothing else that wasn't anticipated that may require further attention..So it's not bad so far, but it is a little concerning nevertheless and causing me a level of stress and anxiety! ?.Regards,.DonD"
Cataract,Do both eyes heal at same rate after cataract surgery?,"Can you expect the same healing rate between both cataract eye surgeries?ex...one eye sees no starburst and sees crisp clear one day after, while other eye didnt have same experience.."
Cataract,epiretinal membrane in one eye,I have an epiretinal membrane in my dominant eye. How will this affect cataract surgery? Anyone have experience with this. I already know my choices are a monofocal lens - maybe or maybe not with an astigmatism correction. Have been putting this off. late 70's in age.
Cataract,Condition of my epiretinal membrane determines which kind of IOL I can have,"I am a 69 year old photographer and artist who plans to never retire. I saw a retina specialist for the second time recently. He said that the foveal depressions in both of my epiretinal membranes (one eye worse than the other) have been stable for two years. He suggested that I get my cataract surgery first before possibly dealing with my retina issue. My opthalmyologist, who has done thousands of cataract surgeries, said that implanting the Acrysol toric (for my astigmation) PanOptix lenses would would worsen my retina condition. He suggested that via Femto laser surgery, he would implant the Acrysol toric Monofocal lens for distance in one eye and for close-medium vision in the other eye. Is he correct in his estimation? Does anyone have experience or knowledge about this? Is his plan my only option? I was hoping to possibly be eyeglasses-free for the first time since I was eight years old. Is this a pipedream?"

Cataract,How to clean operated eyes when close up vision is gone after long distance IOL,"Hi!having second eye done tomo march 12 one week after 1 st eye was done. both will be for far distance toric monofocal.problem having to clean discharge..excess gooey guck discharge from eyelashes, and overflow . sort of like touching the outer gook on eyelash and it then pulls out the attached gook debris with it..wont be able to see close enough now to do this..think magnifying makeup mirror would be the best plan? thanks!?"
Cataract,Got second Panoptix Trifocal this morning,"I got the first one four weeks ago and I was ecstatic. Immediately after post-op, I could see faces further away than 2 feet. I hadn't been able to do that for months.It only got better from there. In that eye, I have perfect vision at all distances except for the tiniest print up close. Early in the morning, it was a little blurry and I used reading glasses +1.25 to read my phone just to make it clearer. Once I wake up more, I don't use any glasses.I do see the halos driving at night but it's a small price to pay compared to the cataracts.This morning, I got the second eye done. Removed my eye shield to put in the second drop and just started looking around. Noticed it's blurry and there is a bit of a ring around lights but it's an uneven ring not like the halos I see in the other eye. I know from reading these forums that some people have some blurriness post-op and it clears up over time. I have the 1 day follow-up with my surgeon tomorrow and I'll see what he says. I am disappointed because the first eye was so perfect so early. Keeping hopes up that this is normal.FYI the only pain I've had with both surgeries was the IV insertion and immediately post-op. I took 2 Tylenol and never felt pain since. It's really amazing how little pain there is associated with this procedure."
Cataract,"Bad Monovision result- dizzy, nauseated need options","I had cataract surgery on my right eye - single focus iol for distance vision and same two weeks later on my left eye for near vision. I loved the result on my first eye! Had the second eye done targeting a -1.5D which I had tried outcwith contacts beforehand. After the surgery I could not get my far vision to blend. It has been 3 weeks after the last eye and I am so dizzy and nauseated I can't leave the couch. Vision still won't blend. Doctor says my distance eye declined to -.5d and my reading eye went to -1.75. I believe it is now too much monovision. I can put in a contact in my left eye and it relieves the nausea somewhat but still unable to function well. Can't seem to wear glasses unless both lenses have the same power. Monovision just doesn't seem to work well with glasses. Nausea and imbalance are worse if I try to bring my eyes up to full power with either contacts or glasses.

Cataract,Just had PanOptix Trifocal IOL ,"I have been reading everybody’s experience and I’m very concerned. I to had PanoOprix trifocal surgery on February 5 on my right eye and again February 26 on my dominant eye. My reading vision is amazing and my mid range vision like watching TV looking out in my own room is great however, when I’m driving during the day I do see small rings around the headlights which is disturbing. But most disturbing is evening nighttime driving the glares and rings are so large they surpassed the cars and feel like they’re coming into my lane which causes me not being able to drive it at night. The only saving grace I heard from my doctor and hearing a few people out here is that you might have to wait 2 to 6 months before you notice a change and there can definitely be a change. Is there anybody out there who have had great response with this lens but it did take time and patience i would love to hear feom you! because my thought is I need to probably get them out however I spent all this money on them and I do not want to go that route if it all possible. Please give me some feedback."

Cataract,Snowflake in Central Vision When Blinking ,"It's been about 2 and a half weeks since I had cataract surgery to my left eye. All in all I'm pretty happy happy with it although I had some concerns that I wrote about in another post. I still have the edge glare but even that doesn't seem as bad as it was. However one thing I have noticed is that if I look at a bright light and blink, I see a symmetrical snowflake like geometry in my central vision. I do not see any lights when my eyes are closed so I do not think this is retina related. I've had enough retinal issues in my life to know what that looks like. Also the snowflake doesn't stay there but only appears for like a millisecond after a blink but it's harder to discern when not looking at a bright light or white background. Has anybody every seen this kind of thing after cataract surgery? Or have an idea of what it is?"
Cataract,Dr's recommending EDoF/MF IOL.I'm not yet convinced,"I have Kaiser insurance so went to see an ophthalmologist in the network who confirmed my cataracts. He first asked me if I would consider monovision and when I replied negative immediately jumped to Panoptix as his recommendation. It was a short conversation and ended with the nurse informing me it would be 4 or 5 months before surgery and they would call me about a month out. They also told me to come back in 2 weeks for eye measurement and that I could not wear my contacts during those 2 weeks (wth?).Understanding that I would have to pay for a premium lens anyway, I sought out another opinion outside the network with a Dr. that did my wife's lasik. It was a much more comprehensive and enjoyable experience. I spoke with the Dr. at length about my visual priorities which are in order:1 Distance vision2. Contrast sensitivity3. Low light vision/night driving (lack of halos)4. Mid-range vision5. Near visiionInteresting but besides the point, they measured my eyes right there and then and had no concerns about whether I had been wearing contact lenses or not (wtf?)He confidently offered the Symfony lens as his recommendation. His reasoning was that my relative youth (55), good eye health other than the cataracts, and active lifestyle (triathlete) would be better served with an EDoF IOL. He felt that I would be able to adapt to the lens well, and claimed my distance vision and contrast sensitivity would be as good as a monofocal IOL. He did not seem too concerned with night driving or light aberrations. The delta in cost between the EDoF and monofocal IOLs was an eye-watering (pun intended) $9K. Honestly, the more I read about the drawbacks of EDoF/MF IOLs, and better than expected outcomes with monofocal IOLs, the less I'm convinced these recommendations are right for me. If any professionals are willing to share their expertise, or any patients to share their experiences, I would be most grateful. Thank you!"
Cataract,Questions about 2nd YAG procedure,"Following my recent catarract surgery, my eye surgeon carried out a capsulotomy on both eyes as I was experiencing halos and flickering (PCO severity was 2 out of 10). However, since the YAG procedure, I now have lots of glare and long streaks of light at night which is making driving impossible (the halos and flickering is still there). I read that enlarging the opening may remove the big starbursts of light. I am concerned that this may not help and could lead to other issues such as ghosting images.Has anyone got experience of having additional YAG that could help me with the following questions:what was your experience after the 2nd YAG procedure, any complicationsdid increasing the size of the opening in the lens capsule help with your symptoms (especially with the starbursts)Any thoughts or comments would be much appreciated."
Cataract,Blurry vision since cataract surgery ,I had surgery on my left eye 3 weeks ago using the toric lens and have been amazed at the change in my vision. I had my right eye done 9 days ago and my vision is still blurry which is VERY discouraging. I have contacted my surgeon and was told to be patient because everyone heals at a different rate. Has anyone else had issues with blurriness that lasted this long?
Cataract,PanOptix experience,"(apologies for starting a new thread, but my last one was more a question about PanOptix before I chose that route. Seems like it'd make more sense if someone was searching for info/testimonials that a new thread specific to my experience with the lenses. )I'm 45, very active/athletic(competitive mountain bike racer, motocross rider, skier/snowboarder), and have been fortunate enough to have had 20/15 vision up until a few years ago. Not wanting to adapt to readers or other prescription glasses that accompany monofocals, I opted for PanOptix over Symfony partially due to the loose recommendation of my doctor, and mostly because once I was aware of their existence, the clinical studies I was able to find online seemed to show that PanOptix tested at least as good as Symfony in all manners, showed some level of reduced night artifact/glare/halos, and promised near-vision, in addition to midrange and distance vision.I'm 4 days post-op of a PanOptix in my right eye, with the sole motivation of surgery to treat my rather severe cataracts. That eye was the worst of the pair, and now that I have what was considered my ""good"" eye as a baseline to compare the new lens to an old one, it's definitely a mixed bag.Like basically anyone who's had IOL's implanted, the newfound vibrance in colors is phenomenal. There was a yellow wall that my old eye perceived as being gray the other day, if that's any indication of the difference. The day after surgery, my vision tested at 20/25 in the new lens, as opposed to 20/60 before surgery. I didn't have any eye issues that required glasses before surgery; it was simply the cataracts that was causing such poor vision. So, compared to my vision a couple of years ago, 20/25 is still technically a degredation for me.Near vision is another positive with PanOptix, but it's admittedly a bit finicky with exact distance. Roughly 12-inches is the sweet spot where text is clearest. A few inches past or closer than that, and things begin to soften up. Text doesn't get too terribly blurry, and doesn't seem to progress into being completely illegible as distance away from the sweet spot increases, but there's an absolute sweet spot of near focus for sure. Midrange is somewhat disappointing for the claims and studies on PanOptix, as sitting at my desktop computer approximately 24-inches from the screen results in less-than-sharp focus. I have to get right up to within 12-inches of the screen to get the crispest focus, which is where the near vision focus is. Seems like these are almost bifocals and not trifocals.Nighttime vision overall in the PanOptix eye is good. I don't notice a reduction in contrast like my doctor thought might be the case with the division of light to three points. It definitely didn't improve my night vision by any means, but it didn't seem to reduce it. My cataracts is very central in my original lens, so I actually see best at night when my pupil is dilated big enough to see around it.Halos around all lights are very apparent, not only at night but during the day as well, and the halos even have that little spiderweb effect. One or two lights at a time, and it seems manageable. But, I just drove on the highway tonight and realized how much I was relying on my natural lens to see. With that eye closed, the PanOptix eye was creating such drastic halo that it seemed like it was keeping that eye from finding focus on anything. Truly blurred vision if there's more than a few lights, which was both scary and perplexing on what to do for my other eye as I can't imagine getting through the rest of my life without the ability to operate a car, walk through the city, etc. at night.From the first day of surgery, I've also had a flicker in the PanOptix eye. The followup doctor(who I'd never met, and won't see again) said that's normal and should go away, but it hasn't really subsided in 4 days. I notice it gets much worse when there's light shining in from my peripheral.Distance vision is worse with the PanOptix eye than my natural eye, which is disappointing. This discrepancy is amplified at night, especially if it involves reading street signs or things like neon lights.I see my optometrist on Friday, and will share what he says about the debilitating night vision, flickering, and lack of midrange focus. Oh, I also noticed today that if the sun is directly in front of my vision and I have sunglasses on, that a reflection of the PanOptix IOL shows up in my sunglass lens. That wasn't expected, not sure if anyone else has had the same or similar experience with any other lens?"
Cataract,Reading eye prescription,"Hello allI have previously requested help from this group with learning why I was told by my specialist that I should consider getting iols for MONOVISION.The replies were helpful.Here is my eye prescription from two years ago (ie, prior to my latest exam which identified the need for cataract removal and iol insertion.)RIGHT eyesphere -3.25cyl -1.75axe 95ADD 2.50Seg 23LEFT eyesphere -.25cyl -1.5axe 65ADD 2.50seg 23Can anyone tell me if there is there anything in this prescription that would indicate that I would be a good candidate for MONOVISON iols (as opposed to Monofocal or Multifocal iols)?Thanks in advance."
Cataract,"High myopia, vitrectomy inbound and anticipated cataract surgery afterwards, any advice appreciated","Been reading on here for a little while, anticipating cataract surgery later this year so looking for recommendations and information.A little background in case anyone is interested:At 40, I had what I feared was a retinal detachment, I was walking outside and had a big black shape come down from above. I'm a high myope, so I've always read I was at risk for that and the next morning was being seen. I was told it was a large floater, right in the middle of my vision and shown a picture. They said I had no retinal detachment, and that it would either go away on it's own or I would adapt to it and learn to ignore it.3 years went by, and it was still sitting dead in the middle of my vision, moving only slightly left and right. I began to notice when I looked in the mirror, that my right eye was turning inward where my left eye was straight; it was as if I was trying to always look around the floater, it looked like I was crosss-eyed just in the right. I heard about the laser vitrectomy (essentially using the laser to break up the floater), and there was a doctor within driving distance of here. I made an appointment, was told it wouldn't be a problem, and had to go twice because he couldn't do it in one go, it was too dense. A piece of the floater he couldn't get an angle to hit, but my central vision was clear and I could ignore the remaining small ones. I was happy for about 5 months, then I started to get more floaters of all types. What was different now is that rather than the one large floater (and smaller ones that were easy to ignore, I always had lots of small ones), it's more like looking through a cloud of floaters.This has been going on for 7 more years, I'm now 50. This last year I've somewhat hit a wall; the cloud has become denser, I'd describe it more like looking through soup. Everything in that eye is several shades darker than the other, similar to a cataract. Unlike a cataract, I think I can't adapt to just using the other eye because of all the constant movement of the floaters and the soup. If I move my eye rapidly, I can sometimes get it to clear in the center and I can see that my vision is quite good (other than the myopia of course).I've seen two top retinal surgeons, both say my retina is healthy, and that I suffered a PVD in that eye, probably at 40 when the large floater first appeared. Interesting comments they made included that a doctor there had a vitrectomy for floaters and they had ""less than you have"" and that they understand why I'm having issues because I have ""more than my fair share"" of them. Obviously I don't want to risk my sight on eye surgery (the vitrectomy and the cataract surgery that will follow typically 6 months later).While my vision is better some days then others, I started getting double vision on occasion due to the difference between my eyes looking through the soup. It seems to have become a little thicker. I try to avoid driving at night whenever possible, as I otherwise have to close my right eye. I need to drive 2 hours every day to from work and taking the kids to school, so... the vitrectomy is in 3 weeks. I don't want to do this, but if it hasn't become better after a decade, it's probably not going to. Quite terrified, actually, even though I know it will probably be fine. I tell myself on the brightside, that with the cataract surgery and lens replacement, I can know what it's like to not need contacts (or hopefully need a lower power). I mentioned I've always been highly myopic since I was a child, -15 in the right and -13.5 in the left. I've been told I will see really well with any replacement lens, better than I ever have in my life due to my myopia, can anyone say if that is truly the case?After reading here, I was really convinced the Symfony was the way to go; then I read about the Panoptix. While I'm used to visual oddities, I think I've come full circle back around and think if I have to make a choice that the mini-monovision is the safest way to go with some myopia, I don't mind if I still need glasses, but it would be nice to not need them for everything. Anyone a high myope or has experience with a vitrectomy and this process, and any advice, particularly with recovery or selecting a lens? It seems there is praise and criticism for every lens, no real consensus or a safe choice. Thanks for taking the time to read this and if you respond."
Cataract,Flickering lights and feels like I'm looking through water,"Hi all,I have my first cataract surgery on Jan 2 & second surgery on Jan 16. I have Baush & Lomb toric lenses for astigmatisim. Since then, I've had a light show going off all around the sides and bottom of my vision. It also feels like my eyes are floating in water, at least that's what I see. The worst is in bright lights like at Walmart, etc. Sunlight doesn't bother me too much. Even in dim light, I see reflection. And seeing what looks like water is awful. My doctor keeps telling me it will go away but I'm concerned that it will not. Has anyone had this go away?? My doc says it could take a year. It's driving me crazy!"

Cataract,Flickering light in eye after Cataract surgery,"Hi allI'm recovering from cataract Implant surgery in my left eye, It''s been nearly a month since my surgery, I've found in the early morning that the light in the partial darkness of the bedroom is not an issue with my eye, but as some of you have already talked about bright light then I have to agree with you all.In bright light I to have this flickering which comes from the left side of my periferal vision and then spreads from left to right and yes its very annoying, as I type this comment I'm having to shield the light with my left hand against the side of my face to somewhat stop the side dazzle it doesnt however stop the flicker when I move my eye left to right, when I'm looking straight forward I dont get the flicker.I had a cataract operation and Implant in my right eye done about 7 years ago and cannot recollect having these flickering problems then ? my optician said its possible that the light reflection is coming from the implanted lens and radiating around, she said my eye needs time to settle. I hope as others have said that time is a great healer and that it eventually disappears on its own, as it is driving me nuts at present, perhaps using sunglasses with a side cover on might help me, well its something I'm going to try."

Cataract,Panoptix - YAG decision,I'm a 42 year old male who had a wonderful cataract operation about 2 months ago. Eye is all healed. I'm seeing that eye can be dry most days in the night when I wake up. The doctor has checked this and ruled out dry eye syndrome.The eye doctor has chosen the right power with very small variation (-.5) in power. I chose PanOptix lens.My vision was very good right after cataract surgery - I was able to read the last line letters during the eye exam.Here are my challengesMy questionsEverything I identified also comes as PCO symptoms but I've been having the symptoms from the day of the cataract surgery. Could this be from PCO Vs Positive Disphotophsia?What I've heard is Halos and Starburst can get worse with YAG sometimes. How often does this happen?Flickering may get better and there may be also be floaters from YAG. How often does this happen?
Cataract,Crazy question..how is breathing under that head drape,during surgery. Is it like being under a blanket?? I'm nervous
Cataract,catarac surgery panoptic lense,I'm scheduled for surgery on Tuesday to get the new lens implanted. How does everyone like it?
Cataract,Intermediate vision after monofocal toric IOL,hello. who had monofocal toric or even reg mo offical IOL and was able to see intermediate vision... 2 feet and further...? I understand you must need close up near like your cellphone etc..but a little further? can the long distance monofocal(toric in this case) let you see intermediate decently? like cooking..talking to someone 2 ft away..etc..thanks!
Cataract,Just Implanted with Pan Optix IOL - Very Happy!,"I was scheduled to get Restor 2.5 implant, but the Pan Optix Trifocal got approved in the US two weeks prior to my scheduled cataract surgery. My ophthalmologist, although an excellent surgeon, refused to make a recommendation either way. I spent countless hours researching IOL's.I have been a very nearsighted person for at least 50 years of my life. I rarely wore my glasses in school, even though my eyesight was very poor. My mother told me that glasses were probably making my eyes weaker, and I would get dependent on them, so I should try to wear them as little as possible. So, I basically walked around in a blur, until I finally decided I deserved to see better.I got contact lenses at age 18. Over wore the contacts and became contact lenses intolerant with dry eyes. Had to put up with thick glasses for years, which I hated. I still wore contacts sometimes and they were multifocal with monovision (undercorrected left eye). I adjusted to this very easily. I also wore progressive eyeglasses, which were only correcting my vision to 20/50. I drove pretty well with huge halos everywhere. Only 62 with stage 3 cataracts.Decision criteria:I hated wearing eyeglassesI could neuroadapt to any visionI didn't want to completely lose my near visionI work on a computer with dual monitors 10 hours a day all week longI like reading, knittingI drive at night, but very used to huge halos - Happy as long as I can see the road and not hit a tree!I knew I would not be happy with monofocal lenses, since I would suddenly be thrown into the world of ""far"".So, I chose the Pan Optix trifocal, and I was thrilled Day One when they rolled me out, I could read the clock. Everything was so bright and beautiful. Driving back from surgery that I could read road signs. Next day, far vision was 20/25. Near was a blur. A week later, near was clear too!!Second surgery on the other eye, 2 weeks later; first lens had a scratch and had to be withdrawn. Dr. had a replacement lens on hand, however, the eye required stitches. This time vision was not clear right away. The eye had more trauma and suffered from corneal edema. Thankfully, after 3 days of eyedrops and resting, the vision started coming back, and the left eye is now as clear as the right.In conclusion, I am thrilled to have such great vision at all distances. There are some halos around lights while driving. Headlights look like little sparklers to me, but I find driving 100% better than pre-surgery, and things are very bright and clear, so all is good there. I would highly recommend the Pan Optix."
Cataract,target diopter for second eye,"I had a ZCB00 in my right eye set to intermediate (about -1.25D to -1.5D). It's time for LE surgery.The surgeon said the power calculation would not be very accurate because I had PRK before. She is planning to set it to plano, but saying it would end up with far-sighted due to my corneal condition after PRK (not the lens settlement error). So she also offered to set it at -0.5D to reduce the chance to be far-sighted, as she said I won't feel comfortable far-sighted as I have been near-sighted from very young.I asked how about targeting to -0.25D. She didn't think it's meaningful for only 0.25.Anyone has an idea about the real visual acuity of -0.5D? How far could I see with this diopter assuming the calculation is accurate?Should I insist to -0.25D target or just choose -0.5D or even plano? My goal is to be spectacle free in most of the time. I can read computer and phone with RE now and am fine to use reading glass for books."

Cataract,Opinions on Cataract Surgeon Experience,"Hello, I am new here and in fact stumbled across this website when I was googling about my cataract surgery results. I'd like to share my experience to get some feedback from you. I will try to be as objective as possible.1.) I am 52 and highly myopic. About -10 dipoters in the right eye and about -10 in the left with -3 astigmatism in the left eye as well.2.) I had retinal detachments in both eyes in my early 20s but have had scleral buckles in both eyes and haven't had any retinal troubles since. Every retinal surgeon I've had has mentioned how well the original surgeon had attached the buckles and how unlikely I will ever have trouble with retinal detachments in my life.4.) I had a posterior vitreous detachment in my left eye about 3 years ago that resulted in a huge Weiss ring in my central vision. My retinal surgeon performed a vitrectomy and cleared that all up nicely.5.) I also had a posterior vitreous detachment in my right eye which didn't require a vitrectomy.6.) I have always worn glasses and soft contact lenses both throughout my life.7.) I found it harder and harder to see out of my left eye and my retinal surgeon determined that I had a big cataract forming probably due to my high myopia and all of the surgeries I had to it.8.) According to the retinal surgeon I also have a small cataract forming in my right eye as well although it doesn't bother me.9.) The retinal surgeon referred me to a cataract surgeon to have my cataracts removed.10.) After going through extensive tests at the cataract surgeon's office the assistant doctor (not the surgeon) and I thought it might be best to set my left eye for intermediate vision and my right eye to distance vision. She also thought it made more sense to get a toric lens for both eyes even though I only had a little bit of astigmatism in the right eye. But she said she wouldn't recommend the multifocals due to the halo/glare issues nor would she recommend the Crystallens/Trulign family as they were twice the price and I the modified monovision I was going to get would have similar results.11.)So I paid for the cheaper Toric lens and not the Crystallens/Trulign.12.) When the doctor examined me he was very brusque and kind of rude actually. Out of the blue he made a comment how my scleral buckles could break any time and that my eyes were a real challenge for him to get the prescription right, etc. I didn't know what to say especially about the buckle comment but it bothered me.13.) The plan was to do the left eye first and then the right eye a week later.14.) In surgery as he was cutting in my eye, he started yelling at his nurse about how she is not keeping up with inventory or something and made her apologize to him as she was irrigating me. This also bothered me.15.) In recovery they gave me the box for the lens they implanted and it was in fact the Trulign lens (even though I picked and paid for the normal Toric lens).16.) I did research and found out that the Trulign lens is made of silicone which is not recommended for patients with retinal history due to a contraindication with silicone oil used in some retinal detachment surgeries. This is the same guy who out of the blue shared how my buckles might just break someday.17.) I then started to have edge glare issue coming in from the left side of my face.18.) Now here is me getting paranoid. But I started to wonder if the inventory issue that he was yelling at the nurse about had to do with my Toric lens not being available so he sacrificed one of his more expensive lenses to get me out the door. I also wonder if the Toric lens diameter was not correct for my pupil size since I've heard this can cause edge glare. However, the resulting acuity of the prescription is perfect!!!19.) The box did have my name on it with prescription so it does look like it was purposely ordered and not just thrown in at the last second.20.) Today I went back for my post-op follow up. Everything looked fine and I'm healing well. My visual acuity is right where it should be.21.) I asked the doctor about the edge glare and he gave an ""ahh crap"" look on his face and just said ""can you live with it?"" He said that we don't want to do any more work in that eye and that the bag is loose and the sky is falling kind of negativity that he seems to have. I didn't get a straight answer whether the edge glare will go away or what other risks he was talking about. Especially since he never told me of any such risks before he did the surgery. He just made it sound like the scleral buckles are doomed to fail at some point and all the structures in the front are loose and I guess just plain awful.22.) I then asked the doctor about why he used the Trulign lens when I had picked and paid for the cheaper one. He made it sound like he did me a favor and that he felt I could use the accommodation especially since I'm only in my 50s and not 70s. He now said that ""I gotta live life"" and I can't wear an inferior lens because of the possibility someday of having a retinal detachment that required silicone oil. WHAT?? Mr. YourScleralBucklesMayBreak is suddenly optimistic.23.) I then asked what we should put in the right eye and he said Crystallens since I don't need a Toric but but then went on to say that he will give me a good deal on it so I won't have to pay full price. But that I should have these accommodating lenses because they are better for my situation.24.) After talking about how my eye structures were really loose and I may have problems in the future (I guess along with my scleral buckles snapping), I asked if it's wise to even do the cataract surgery in my right eye since I can see with them very clearly (with contacts).25.) He agreed and immediately canceled my surgery and honestly I was kind of relieved.26.) I won't be able to wear glasses now that 1 eye is -10 diopters and the other eye sees 20/20 intermediate (magnification differential is huge). So I will always have to put a contact lens in my right eye to function.27.) The doctor did do a good job getting the prescription correct and it is healing fine however....Questions:1.) Is it realistic for me to not have the other cataract surgery so that I will have to wear a contact but cannot wear glasses. It's kind of awkward but I do see good with the contact lens in.2.) I read that the Trulign silicone lenses are not known for having edge glare issues. Do you think the doctor put a lens in with the wrong pupil size?3.) He made me feel like my eye is going to fall apart either from the back or the front. Do you think he is right?4.) Did he pull a bait and switch on me?5.) The Trulign lenses have other unique risks like the accommodation getting stuck in a certain position. Shouldn't I have known these risks and agreed to them before he just decided to put one in for me?6.) Do you think that he did have my interest in mind when he put the Trulign accommodating lens in or do you think it was a mistake that he didn't want to own up to?Well anyway that was my experience today and honestly I feel pretty horrible. I'm not sure if he was actually acting in my best interest but just had a really terrible bedside manner or if he was a bit lazy and didn't want to address my edge glare issues cautioning me to not have anything else done to my eye. Or worse that he was kind of a shyster con-man as well. I'm curious what you guys think."
Cataract,Cataract and Symfony Toric Multifocal EDOF experience,"Had cataract surgery last week and wanted to capture my experiences so far.I’m 47 and my prescription prior to cataract was mild astigmatism and a little long sighted (started having to hold my phone at arms length) but otherwise vision acceptable all day without correction. In fact I didn’t bother wearing my glasses unless watching something on HD TV or cinema that looked worthwhile. Had floater only vitrectomy 10 years ago and some laser treatment for lattice degeneration of optic nerve. So I expected a cataract, which grew over last year and had made me extremely short sighted.Went private and went with suggestion of Symfony Toric EDOF Multifocal ZXT. Not sure what these numbers mean but the detail I’ve been given says:Model ZXT150. ØT 13mm ØB 6mmdiopter +22.0D SE 1.50D CYLOperation was completely painless and I couldn’t see anything but white and some darkish shapes. I asked for sedation so had diazepam which relaxed me. Only discomfort was the pre-op eyeball injection (!!) for nerve block, but it was actually over before I knew it and I had had anaesthetic drops prior. I think surgeon used sonic to break up cataract and scalpel to open eye up. Sounds horrible but it was easy and I was quite relaxed throughout. Eyepatch on after the 15 min surgery and quickly discharged to go home.A few hours later the block wore off and pain and discomfort was actually quite significant. Much more than I expected. Also my eye was constantly watering and I couldn’t keep it open or closed comfortably. Paracetamol helped though. A sneak peak under the patch showed yellowish vision, very blurry. Not able to focus/align both eyes on anything. Slept okDay 1 post op. Pain and discomfort reduced but still an achy pain. Bloodshot eye. Very Watery. Vision is blurry and out of focus. But can align both eyes on any subject. Blue/purple tint to white objects, walls etc. A few small floaters. Exaggerated 3D effect when looking at objects at various depths, but like objects in binoculars. Diagonal streaks with bright lights on dark background. Especially white text on black background on TV.Day 2/3 Jittery peripheral movement when moving eye. Vision like 80s soft focus TV shows. Achy pain gone. Still bloodshot.Street lights at night have large starburst with a single huge diagonal streak. This streak is on every light source, including TV. White on black text has white glow around all text.Day 4 started work with VDU, had to turn brightness right down, office lighting too bright, headaches after VDU usage. Jittery/Shimmering right side possibly worse. No really sign of concentric rings on night lights, maybe if I concentrate I think i can make them out? but starburst effect predominant. Still violet tint to whites.Day 5 started day worse with dry eyes, feeling like something in my eye, headache, still bloodshot. Still sleeping with eye patch.Floaters are completely gone.Starting to see distance more clearly - can read small text at a distance clearer than left eye that has mild astigmatism.Day 6. Same as day 5 really. Eye starts day a bit sore and blurry and gets better throughout day. Still have violet tint and shimmering effect to my right peripheral. I have the fuzziness around white on black writing, which is common, but the text is crisp. Bit like this fig 5Thoughts so far. I’m really surprised how long the recovery has taken. Mainly because a younger coworker had a cataract op with a basic lens and had absolutely no post op symptoms!! After day 4 when my vision started to get sharp and lose some of the fuzziness I started to feel happy with the result. Yes there’s still some fuzziness under some conditions and I get starbursts (not halos) on street lights and cars but they don’t bother me. I can easily see myself adapting to these artefacts over time. The only thing annoying me at moment is the single diagonal streak across all light sources including bright areas on TV.So on the whole happy at this stage, but having to realign expectations for a slower recovery."
Cataract,Tecnis Synergy VS Symfony ,can some one tell us about there experience ? is it worthy ? how can he or she see after surgery ? and what to expect from synergy or symfony ? i am 33ans i have conginital cataract i read alot of negative experience about the vision after the surgry ? have some one have some positive experience
Cataract,Monovision (after cataract surgery) ,Interested in knowing what makes a good candidate for this option ( vs monofocals or multifocals.)Professional suggested I consider this option. However was very light on details as to why I would make an appropriate candidate. Suggested I start by trying out contact lens.Thanks
Cataract,How long after cataract surgery is lens exchange possible?,"I know doctors prefer not to wait too long, but what about 2 or 3 yrs? **"
Cataract,Astigmatism and Visual Aberrations,"Just had to talk about this phenomenon of astigmatism , lens implantation and resultant unwanted visual aberrations.I have reg eye Doc appoint March 2 at which point I will discuss these large images with her post surgery. I have not called her as I don't consider this an emergency but I do consider it a situation of high annoyance and quite frankly unacceptable outcome.I have been all over this internet, medical journals, You Tube etc to see this subject being discussed. They talk of Vaseline Eye, Halos, Starbursts, Glare and Arcs. No one to my knowledge has seen what I see and that truly concerns me. Truly bizarre and probably coming from one of the areas of my (L) eye where I had R.L.I. that didn't straighten the cornea well enough. The doctor did mention having laser if I needed it on my way out the door.This whole process seemed to be way to fast and information given was very fast and way over my head in ophthalmology terms and explanation of the procedure at that time and I am a nurse! I realize these procedures are many and performed daily but I felt like a number. This doctor was referred to me by my reg eye Doc for his precision and wonderful work.I don't live in the town he operates off of so this was a 4 day ( find drivers) situation.I wish I had stayed in my own town with our top Eye Specialist but I didn't. I feel sure the doc I was referred to didn't need my business but she made appointment with her assurance.I imagine I can either ask her to intervene or have her prescribe me a pair of glasses to stop those aberrations from the astigmatism from highly frustrating me. I have appointment with my surgeon in April and explain it to him and see what he offers me. I hope to get released from this very disturbingsituation.I hope the next time I get on here there will be a plan to correct this phenomenon. In the mean time if any of you know anyone who is experiencing these same symptoms or have any articles of interest I would appreciate reading them.If there are any of you who are experiencing what I have described or anyone you know who has I would appreciate your replies."
Cataract,Post-YAG Problem - Glint in Center of Vision,"I've just had YAG on one eye post-cataract surgery (Crystalens). I was diagnosed with PCO almost immediately after the IOL implact. Vision was good prior to YAG, except for halos and other night-vision issues. Now I'm seeing what seems like a small amount of reflected light or glint in the center of my vision, always in the same location. It's intermittent, but very distracting. Doctor says there is no damage visible anywhere and he's stumped. I read about epiretinal gliosis after my last visit - do you think the doctor would have seen that during a pretty thorough exam (with dilation)?Appreciate your thoughts very much."
Cataract,Has anyone tried the Carl Zeiss i.Scription glasses for post IOL dysphotopsia/starbursts?,"In my attempt to see if I can tone down my starburst from oncoming headlights and concentric circles for brakelights, etc., I stumbled across these glasses online. Has anyone tried them and can share if they were helpful or for that matter any other glasses? I'm trying seeing if I can live with the dysphotopsia as opposed to exchange surgery, which I am also considering. Thanks."
Cataract,I need feedback on the J&J TECNIS® 1-Piece IOL ZCB00 ,I'm looking for information on this lens. Anyone out there that had been using this lens for 6 months or more?
Cataract,FEMTO second laser assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) ,"I have worn glasses since I was 8 years old for both myopia and astigmatism. I am now 69 years old and have had presbyopia for quite a while and need cataract surgery. I am a photographic artist and my eyesight is most important for my work. My neuro-opthalmologist, who has been following my eyes for several years, has been doing laser procedures and cataract surgeries for 20 years but has never done FEMTO-laser assisted cataract surgery (FLACS), which he wants to learn. He said he would learn the procedure one day and the next day would implant an Alcon Acrysol Panoptix trifocal toric lens (while his teacher assisted) in my first eye and perhaps my second eye a month or so later. Should I be worried? Has anyone had experience with FLACS?"
Cataract,Has Any One Else Noticed this Unusual Vision Issue with Symfony Lens,"I had a cataract surgery on my right eye a week back and decided to go with A Symfony Toric Lens because of all the positive things I have read about the lens. I have had a IOL in my left eye for almost 18 years, which I have been happy with for reading, so that I was looking basically for good distance and intermediate vision with the Symfony (I am used to monovision for the last 25 years).My right eye still has some astigmatism (slowly improving), had issue with seeing streaks from lights for only the first 3 days, am seeing halo around the lights (will probably get adjusted to it), but also have another interesting vision issue which I had not seen mentioned by any of the doctors or the patients on the web. Using just my right eye, I don't just see a halo around a light, but see about 7 perfect concentric circles around the light, with the diameter of the outermost circle being about 3-4 times that of the halo diameter. Since the Symfony lens has the unique feature of having about the same number of circular “diffractive echelette design” in the lens, I am sure that the concentric circles which I am seeing is because of this proprietary design.Looking through these circles to look at a light is like looking at a light through a spider web. It is not so bad that I wish that I had not selected Symfony lens (I like the Extended Vision), but why has this effect not been publicized more? Have any of the other Symfony Lens users experienced seeing these concentric circles?"
Cataract,Comment on lighting?,I'm beginning to discover that it's possible one needs more light to read using an IOL (set for near) than pre-cataract surgery.Would someone like to comment on anything they have learned thru trial and error regarding lighting when reading after cataract surgery?
Cataract,what is one's up close vision like if IOL set at -1.75 or -2.00?,Does one's up close (very very near vision) get a bit more fuzzy if one goes with -1.75 to get a bit more of the 'intermediate' (computer) range?I will ask the doctor but wanted to see if someone here had experience with this type of IOL setting so I would know what to expect (but i know everyone has different factors in their case).Thanks.
Cataract,Blurry patch after yag capsulotomy ,"Hi allAnyone out there had a YAG capsulotomy resulting in intermittent blurriness? The vision is certainly improved from pre-laser when the blurriness is less evident. If I look straight ahead with my eyes still the vision quickly becomes clear, however the second I move my eyes left or right, up or down the blurry patch returns. The optemetrist from where I had the procedure says that the surgeon intentionally left flaps of the lasered capsule attached to the edges and that they will eventually fold in toward the vitreous. This kind of made sense to me but it's been 2 weeks now and it's exactly the same. How long are you expected to wait for these 'flaps' to fold in? Even if more time was needed for them to move away from my visual axis completely, I would at least expect some difference in my symptoms after 2 weeks. Many thanks all."
Cataract,Pros and cons of YAG?,"After considering options to correct my night driving glare and halos, my doctor is suggesting the Yag procedure. Ive just begun researching this and wonder what others have experienced."
Cataract,Positive results from YAG?,Has anyone had positive results from Yay? Ive heard about warnings and negative results. I wonder if many have had good results or if they would even be on this forum?
Cataract,UPDATES + Preliminary verdict on Mini Mono-Vision.,"20th Nov. 2019..I have got few PMs about people wanting to go with the same mini monovision choice as my wife. Instead of replying privately I thought it would be more beneficial posting here to help others in the future. This thread and updated opinion supersedes everything I might have said in any previous thread!!!!.Lens Used: Zeiss Asphina 509 Aspheric Monofocal (non Toric as astigmatism was negligible -.25 and -.50)Surgeon used: Dr Zeiss (I love giving nicknames)Rejected Surgeons: Dr Headstand, Dr Rockstar, Dr Career and Dr Oldstar (did not meet him though).Left Eye operated: End of September 2019Right Eye Operated: End of October 2019Left eye target was: -1.25Right Eye target was: -0.25 (dominant eye)Time between first sign/diagnosis of Posterior Subcapsular Cataract and going virtually blind: 3-4 months!!!!!!!!Wife: Early 40s, extremely active and had perfect vision without glasses (although cataract probably started forming 1+ year ago and we were just not aware).Question 1- Why did we pick those targets?.Answer 1- Without benefit of hindsight. After days/weeks/months of torture the conclusion was that an error of 0.5 diopter could occur in either direction. Could be more if you end up unlucky or lucky depending on final results. So -0.25 far eye could end up anywhere from -0.75 to +0.25 and the near -1.25 eye could end up anywhere from -1.75 to -0.75..We were tempted to go with -1.65 for near eye but it seemed too risky in case it ended up at -2.15 or more and if the far eye went in opposite direction and ended at +0.25. That would have been a potential difference of 2.75 diopter!!!! Greater than 1.5 diopter difference is considered risky as lot of people can't adapt to it. Also the blend zone between the two eyes decreases..My wife had never worn glasses so we had no clue what it all meant in real world scenario. We could not even test anything realistically as her cataract progressed so fast! So -1.25 & -0.25 = difference of 1 Diopter seemed like a safer choice. We could have gone even more safe, for example both eyes to -0.25 or micro mini monovision..Question 2- Why did we pick Zeiss Asphina IOL?.Answer 2- Well Zeiss is reputable brand and synonymous with quality and has been around for long time. I knew them from their excellent camera lenses. Then the surgeon we picked, Dr Zeiss recommended them and uses them. The only thing holding me back was that it apparently does not prevent PCO. Dr Zeiss said that as most patients specially young patients will get PCO irrespective of lens choice so that should not even be a factor. Also I saw online that people who went with anti PCO marketed IOLs still got it super fast and in addition had more issue from the anti PCO IOL sharp square edge causing glare etc..The Zeiss square haptic was appealing too. More stable and with less exposed edges. Also it seems to have less issues with glistening. The pure Acrylic hydro phobic IOLs seem to have more glistening related issues and I think micro cracks when injected. Zeiss has hydrophobic surface coating only but internally it is hopefully less prone to vision effecting glistening etc. Fingers crossed for next 50 years! lolDr Zeiss said that since he switched 100% to Zeiss IOLs his refractive error surprises have virtually disappeared..Question 3: Why did you not go with Multifocal IOLs?.Answer 3: It was NOT an easy decision but with benefit of hindsight it seems to have been the right decision FOR US! Our research and logical analysis pointed us to mini-monovision. Towards the end emotion and fear played a part and we were tempted towards At Lisa Trifocal. Specially when a user here scared us by saying that my poor wife won't be able to see her face/food/read and be permanently dependent on glasses. Luckily calm head prevailed and Dr Zeiss also said to go with Mini-Monovision even though he is expert at installing AT Lisa/AT Lara and would have made $5000 more..EDOF we rejected as Dr Zeiss said that the results he was getting with them he had been getting with Monofocals for 10+ years. Initially he had got taken in with EDOF marketing and their lab test results..Other surgeons said same. If you want highest quality vision then don't go with EDOF/Trifocal etc.-Monofocals more future proof to future eye health issues. We had to think about next 50 years and not just short term of next few years.-Monofocals have possibility of add on lenses if required. Constantly evolving tech. Add on lenses much easier to add and replace.-Monofocals still have option to use Multifocal contact lenses if required.-Monofocals have less side effects.-Mini Monovision adaption time few days to couple of weeks unlike months or never with multifocals.-Monofocals have way less contrast loss.-Monofocals require less brain gymnastics.-Monofocals have better low light vision.-Monofocals have no rings constantly or semi constantly visible.-Mulifocals have no guarantee of being glasses free without add on Lasik surgery.-We did not want to touch the cornea for corrective Lasik surgery.-You can end up glasses free with mini monovison too and that was our aim as we are a very active couple. It seems like wife will be glasses free as things stand. For us using glasses was not end of the world anyway. Only for sports it would have been complicated but already she is doing sports without glasses..Question 4 - Finally, where did you end up and what are your real life results..Answer 4-.Left Near Eye:Near eye seems to have ended up at -1.75 ( to be confirmed at next appointment). It seems to have stayed stable there since day 7 (today is day 54). With benefit of hind sight, if we had hit the target of -1.25 then wife would definitely not have been happy as reading etc without glasses would have been an issue. So we got lucky for once!!!.My wife currently requires no glasses for PC, mobile phone, laptop, writing reading, eating, cooking, watching TV....she can see herself super sharp in the mirror too. She has been working 8+ hours a day for last 1 month at the office without requiring any glasses. No headaches either although she did have it for first few days when brain was adapting..She can read J1 in all real life lighting conditions. Sweet spot is at 45cm/17in but can read at 35cm/13in too . Usable vision 35cm/13in to 2.5m/98in. For example she can see electronic alarm clock in the bedroom 2.5m /98in away. I feel anything closer than 30cm/11in is wasted diopter so the lowest I would ever go with near eye is -2.0. You do risk then ending up at -2.5..Far Right Eye:.Far eye was targeted for -0.25. This eye has taken or is still taking lot longer to heal unlike the left eye. We don't know where it has landed. We entered week #4 now (Day 26) so still not fully stable as we have to wait 6 weeks. We are seeing Dr Zeiss end of this month so will know the real number. The reading we had were +0.25 then -0.25 but these are very old readings. So we could be at -0.75 or -0.5 or even -0.25 currently. No clue!.On Snellen Eye test chart she now seems to have 20/20 in lock down (1.0). Yesterday she was hitting perfectly two lines below the 20/20 line, I think line No.10 is 20/12.5(1.6). With this far eye she can read close too!!!! J1 at 60cm/23in. Can read even closer than that but sharpness decreases..So it is difficult to guess where she is currently. Her really far vision is not always super sharp yet, it keeps changing from one day to the next. Drops make it super sharp. So could be healing and dry eyes related. The swing is getting narrower though. It is amazing that she started at 20/200 after OP!!!!! Took 3 weeks to get to 20/20 and looks like maybe some more healing still to come!.Side Note-At one point my wife's near eye was at -2.0 and far eye at +0.25. So a difference of 2.25 Diopters. She loved that too and we could not detect any loss of binocularity in real world usage. Obviously someone else in similar situation might not have been able to adapt. Psychologically it was scary knowing that the difference was 2.25 though..PCO status-Left eye 1 day post OP- Had remnants of lens cells. I guess polishing the capsule more would have been risky for that capsule. Intact capsule is very important for younger active patients.Right eye 1 day post OP- Capsule was crystal clear..IOL Edge issues-No lens issues as such. My wife's left pupil at 6.25mm is larger than the IOL middle part at 6mm. In very dark situations when pupil is fully dialated she sometimes can see slight IOL edge. She kind of enjoys it and says that the Zeiss Asphina is saying HELLO to her ? When we walk on a dark street she always say ""Come on Asphina, say hello or are you going to be shy again and hide"" lol.No glare, starburst , halo or edge light bounce issues though..Recovery-This varies a lot too so don't panic! To fully know if the surgery was successful you need to wait 6 weeks.My wife's first eye took 1 week to be stable despite severe reaction to the disinfectant plus steroid drops. 2nd eye took 3 weeks to get to 20/20 or better vision and still healing even though the reaction was lot less..Overall Conclusion-Do your research and pick a good surgeon. Follow up care can end up being very important. Dr Zeiss despite being super busy ended up exchanging 17 emails with us and some include funny comments at a time when we were in panic mode! lol.He replied within one day to us and 15 of those mails were within 3-4 hours!!!!! In comparison Dr Rockstar took 9 days to answer a simple question. Also most surgeons here operate and then pass you on to someone else, kind of washing their hands off you. Dr Zeiss on the other hand even contacted us twice to check up on our progress..Anyway take everything I have written or what anyone else tells you online with a pinch of salt. Don't let people's personal bias and mental issues swing your decision or scare you..Also some people online are too attached to their IOL and take any valid crit of their IOL as a personal attack. Results can also be very subjective, one person's excellent vision can equate to average vision for someone else..Mini-Monovison is not an answer for everyone. Maybe At Lisa would have given us even better results. I am not close minded to think that our way or the IOL brand/choice was the best way. We don't know and it is something no one can know. If the far vision gets even more sharp then it would be a 100% perfect result. As things stand it is already a very good result, we take the results we got with open arms. The fact that it seems to be glasses free is a very welcome bonus..My personal recommendation for what it is worth, go with Mini Monovison using quality Aspheric Monofocals followed by latest generation Trifocals. Where you target it is something you will have to decide for yourself plus with your surgeon. No two eyes are the same. Even the two eyes on the same person are not same lol.**GOOD LUCK!!!!! **.I hope this info helps. I will update final numbers and eye condition news after seeing the surgeon in a week.Lot of people helped me with their time, here and in other forums. THANK YOU!"
Cataract,YAG and Strenuous Activities,"I am 25 years old and 3 months ago I had my bilateral cataract surgery. I can already tell my eyes are starting to get PCO. Probably sooner than later, I will need the YAG treatment.I have asked all the below questions to doctors butI would like to know from the patient's experience too.I would like to know if anyone has done their research before getting the YAG and had selected for the cruciate or the circular method. How did it turn out for you?Also, I would like to know if you are still able to safely exercise and what kind of exercise do you do? Can you lift weights? Run a mile? I don't understand how, with an open posterior capsule, the vitreous wouldn't prolapse forward.What was your recovery like? Did you have swelling/IOP rise ?"
Cataract,IOL exchange surgery due to challending Symfony lens night driving dysphotopsia ,"I had Symfony lens implanted in both eyes one years ago when I was 58 and like many on the many of you on these discussion boards suffer from huge starburst from on-coming headlights and street lights, perfect, large concentric circles from red break lights and other lights, glowing ghost-like shadows of the moon, and white lettering/objectives with a black backing. Diving safely at night is becoming a big issue and the exhausting need to concentrate due to these distractions. If I had known that this level of visual artifacts problems were possible then I would have never gone with these lens let alone pay the high price. I read the clinical trials and the package insert and these side effects were not specific and appear to be underestimates and underreported. I reported these adverse events to Johnson and Johnson and encourage others to do the same. My vision is generally excellent at 20/20 and only have to were reading glasses for fine print. The risks of explantation/replacement/exchanges lens surgery are far higher and scarier than the first implant surgery. I am strongly considering having this surgery and am fine with trading off using reading glasses all the time if I can get these untoward effects to go away. Since I see so well now I am nervous about the risks of this exchange surgery and the risk that the dysphotopsia artifacts would still not go away. My questions are, have any of you with this situation had your lens replaced and what was the outcome? Did you use the the same surgeon? And how many just decided to live with the artifacts and why? Did get a second opinion? Help!"
Cataract,Very frustrated with doctors after cataract surgery. Drastic change in prescriptions,"I had cataract surgery 6 months ago, and chose monovision basic lenses. I was told I would need to wear glasses due to astigmatism, because I couldn't afford the toric lenses.Right eye is dominant for far vision. Left eye for near. After the left eye surgery, I was happy that I could see so far with the right eye, but I was quite surprised that I only had about 6 to 8 inches of clear vision in the left eye. I really thought I would have a long range of vision in the close eye, so was quite surprised I only had a small window of vision. I wanted intermediate vision and the ability to see the computer and phone. It was much closer than they had planned, without clear vision at computer distance. There was a void where the one eye stopped seeing and the other eye started, and it was right at the computer range. Doctor #1 did the surgery, and Doctor #2 handled the after-care. #2 told me that the lens must have been mismarked. He said I needed a lens exchange, but they don't like to do that, so I would need PRK.I have had a blurry like a film over my eyes from day one, and they kept telling me it was dry eyes. It feels more like a film that moves around. On the two week checkup from the second surgery, I was told that I needed YAG laser because I had “wrinkles” in the capsule behind the new lenses. My eyes hurt so badly and I had constant pain. More steroid drops, and nothing helped. I was told to get glasses and all my problems would go away.I was hesitant to get glasses, because I believed there was a major issue that wasn't being addressed. I did a lot of research and realized I have anisometropia....2 diopters difference between the two eyes, and my brain just wasn't adapting to it. They assured me that glasses would solve all my problems, quite surprised that I had learned I had two diopters difference. I reluctantly chose frames at the doctor's optical dept. and without even selecting which lenses I wanted for the glasses, I was told the total AFTER Medicare insurance paid for $165 of the charge, my part was well over $800 for one pair of glasses that I was told I would only need to drive on long distances, since I had 20/30 vision. I refused to pay that much for glasses, and I left!I went to another optical place and ordered glasses, and when they arrived, I jumped backwards from the shock. I simply couldn't wear them, because they weren't clear and I had double vision, and depth perception issues, due to the two diopter difference. I was able to get a refund on those glasses, because I knew they were now considering PRK surgery, and I didn't want an outside optical store to be dealing with the obvious issues I would have to make new lenses for the glasses.I made an appt to see doctor #2 who deals with issues, and when I arrived, they told me they cancelled the appointment. What? Because Dr. #1 wanted to see me. I waited in exam room and a totally different doctor came in and said they were going to fit me with a contact to decide what works best for PRK surgery. I wanted the doctor who solves problems, and got a totally different doctor. They put me in a contact, that I later realized did nothing to change my distance, but only corrected astigmatism! What was the purpose of that? I started to feel like they were playing games with me, and avoiding me seeing doctor #2, because he is great at fixing a major issue.I was becoming desperate for help, since my vision was becoming worse, and computer viewing only made it worse, because I didn't have any clear vision looking at the computer, since there was the void where one eye stopped and the other eye started. I need astigmatism correction since I was having so much eye strain, but glasses are expensive, and I wasn't ready to pay a lot of money, knowing they would have to be changed later, since nothing was being resolved yet. So, I ordered glasses online for an inexpensive quick fix, until I could figure out what they were going to do. Those glasses were just as bad as the first ones, but I could see a little better. Right lens was very thick and very distorted, but I was so desperate to correct the astigmatism.I went back to the surgeon, doctor #1, and he had an attitude!! He acted like I was a problem patient that he didn't want to deal with! I told him I was very frustrated, and he said my newest glasses were the issue. I told him I'm totally open to the glasses being a problem, but I had so much more than glasses going on. They checked them and saw that the progressive lenses were rotated incorrectly, yet never offered to fix them, even though they had an optical department. He knew I only ordered them for a quick fix and was upset because their glasses were so expensive. He told me that's not his problem, even though he owns the clinic! I told him my eyes were getting worse, and he had no idea why. He always insists that I have dry eyes, even though drops do nothing to improve my eyes, and the film over my eyes was never addressed.I thought we were going to discuss PRK surgery, since the other two doctors said I need that. He said he was shooting for 1.5 diopter difference in my eyes, but for some reason it turned out to be 2 diopter difference, and he didn't know why. He assured me the lens was NOT mismarked, like the other doctor told me. I told him I just think my brain isn't adapting to such a difference in the eyes, once I put on glasses. He wasn't concerned in the least that I was having double vision, a film over my eyes, eye pain, eye strain, and couldn't see with the glasses. He said I couldn't have PRK surgery because my insurance wouldn't cover it. I was shocked! I said, “I thought YOU would cover it, since this is not what I wanted!”. He said, “Why should I cover it? I did your surgery. I'm not covering it, and your insurance won't pay for it.”. I asked about the YAG surgery for the wrinkles behind the lenses, thinking that possibly was adding to the multitude of problems I'm having, and he said, “Oh, everybody needs that after cataract surgery, but didn't offer to correct that either!His solution was for me to order “cheap” single vision glasses....even though I NEED progressive lenses. ""Get cheap single vision for distance, and wear readers for close up reading!"" What??? I told him there is no way that would work. He said, “Of course it would work!”. I told him I would be losing intermediate vision all together, and because one eye is for distance and one eye for close up, the readers wouldn't work! He assured me it would. Well....it doesn't work, because I can't see up close with readers. I still haven't even ordered glasses, and I'm actually using my OLD glasses I had prior to surgery because even though my vision isn't great, it at least helps with the astigmatism needs.I just felt like they were covering something, so I got my records and saw that in the beginning, my records showed that I had “guttata—rare” on the record file. It later no longer showed up, so I didn't know if they were hiding something, or if the guttata was no longer there. I read that it's spots on the cornea and the only way to cure it was a cornea transplant. If cataract surgery is done if you have guttata, it makes your vision progressively worse, which is exactly what is happening to my vision. I decided to seek a different opinion, and I went last week to a new doctor. She told me that most people my age have guttata and that wasn't an issue. Totally opposite what I read online.She gave me a completely new prescription, and changed a -.50 to a +.50. I now have 4 different prescriptions and have no idea which one to use to get new glasses.Here are the prescriptions I've received in the past 6 months.SPHERE CYL AXIS ADD#1 Notice the 2 diopter differenceR -0.75 +1.50 015 2.50L -2.75 +1.50 150 2.50#2 This was when he told me to get cheap distant single vision and readers.R -0.75 +1.50 10 NAL -2.50 +1.25 170 NA#3 Went for a second opinion and this is the newest prescription.R +.50 -1.50 95 +2.75 SLAB OFFL -1.50 -1.50 70 +2.75I just sat down today to figure out which prescription to use, and I'm flabbergasted at the difference. Any thoughts on why the Sphere went from a minus .75 to a plus .50? Were the first prescriptions totally wrong, and is that why I couldn't see with the glasses? How can there be such a drastic difference in the refractions? I just want to be able to SEE better!"
Cataract,Double Vision after cataract surgery,"I recently had cataract surgery on both eyes, left eye replaced lens with a toric to correct astigmatism, went well, next month the right eye replaced lens with a standard, then both eyes started to burn, doc advised to lubricate w/non-preservative artificial tears & I stopped steroids drops, then swollen lids developed along with double vision or ghosting and continued burning, blurry eyes. Doc never mentioned the word DIPLOPIA , I found that on the internet. Anyone have experience with this immediately after cataract surgery? If so let me know what is the status of your eyes and what was done to correct condition.

Cataract,Cataract Post-Surgery Results,"I had cataract surgery on my right eye on 10/24/2017 with a Tecnics toric monofocal IOL, standard blade surgery no femtolaser.The vision in my right eye varied a lot for the first four weeks after surgery, some days rather blurry vision worse than 20/40 and a few days 20/25 or better. However the vision seems to be improving and stabilizing in the past two weeks since the post-surgery steroid and NSAID eyedrops were stopped.Today is 6 weeks after the surgery and this morning my right eye vision was the best I've had so far - uncorrected it was better than 20/20, I could read the 20/15 and even the line below that (20/13) for short periods at 20feet distance. I have been getting excellent distance vision the past couple weeks pretty stable, better than 20/25 all morning to early afternoon especially good outdoors in sunlight. However I've noticed my right eye vision degrades in lower light conditions such as driving at night - the signs on the freeway I have to be about half the distance away to read clearly compared to my left eye corrected with eyeglasses that seems to stay about 20/20-20/15 even under the night driving conditions. But in good lighting especially in the morning the right eye is getting close to equal with my left eye's excellent corrected with eyeglasses vision.I went to an optometrist at 4 weeks after surgery and got this distance eyeglasses Rx:OD(right) = PLANO -1.0D cylinder 115 axisOS (left) = -0.50D -1.75D cylinder 177 axisI believe the right eye's astigmatism that was measured at about -1D cylinder a couple weeks ago may have decreased at least in the first half of the day, it may be varying from morning to night. So the eyeglasses I ordered with the above Rx may not to be updated again in a few months since my eye still seems to be healing and improving more. I should get the new eyeglasses delivered later this week so it will be interesting to see if they improve my right eye's vision later in the day and evening to what I'm getting earlier in the day in good lighting.

Cataract,Can anyone recommend an experienced surgeon for an IOL explant op. ,"Unfortunately 1 lens became cloudy 4 years after having MF30 lens implants in 2012, but it gets worse, I also had YAG laser treatment on both eyes 1 year later as i was experiencing ""ghosting"". Now I am told an explant op will be very tricky due to having the YAG treatment.If you've had a similar problem and found a good surgeon would love to hear from you. I live in the Midlands but am prepared to travel."

Cataract,How to avoid vision imbalance after cataract surgery in one eye?,"I was diagnosed with cataract in my right eye and was recommended for surgery. Left eye is OK. I would like to take this opportunity to remove glasses for distance, but I understand that there would be a big difference between the eyes (0 in the right eye after surgery, and -4.25 in the left eye) and this could result in blurred or double vision. I understand that for balancing the eyes I might need a contact lens in my left eye but I cannot insert a contact lens into my eye. What are the possibilities of using glasses only for reading/computer or even for cinema, and to avoid glasses while walking in the street without inserting a contact lens into the left eye? Is there any lens for glasses that can balance the eyes?"
Cataract,Yag laser did not remove cloudy vision after IOL implants,"Can anyone shed some light on my dilemma??I had Intraocular lenses/cataract surgery 7 years ago which was successful up to 3 months ago when I developed cloudy vision in my left eye.

I am worried as he said he wouldn't be happy about replacing the lens. What I cannot understand is that he didn't suggest an alternative option, I have another appointment to go back in May. This cloudiness really distorts my vision when I drive at night, I'm worried that I will have to live with this.

Cataract,"If you have a monofocal set for distance, what is your vision like at close up, intermediate etc.","I have a Symfony multi-focal in my right eye since Feb 2016, I can see a computer screen crystal clear, intermediate / distance vision are around -.75 prescription but I dont wear glasses. Decent results but now is time for my left eye and considering getting a monofocal since the multifocal has given me alot of bad side effects.The doctor said I should get a monofocal set for distance, but wondering for anyone who has a monofocal set to distance, what is your vision like with that eye at close up and intermediate. Maybe use a scale of 1(blurry) - 10 (crystal clear). Like if you look at a computer screen/phone, can you even make out words, or is it completely blurry? How about when looking at someone 3 feet away? At what range does your vision become really good?Thanks to anyone that replies!"
Cataract,can I wear contact lenses after surgery?,"My eyesight after catact surgery for distance is fine but I need glasses to read. I use to wear monovision contacts, can I still do this?"
Cataract,Cataract Surgery - Panoptix Toric in both eyes - My Experience,"I have been reading many of the posts on here and decided to add my experience with my cataract surgery that has recently been done. The info I read pre-procedure was very helpful so I want to share my specifics too.First, some basic background. I am 55. I noticed my vision getting gradually worse for the last 5-6 years. Most of it has been everything looking smokey and foggy/cloudy, especially inside when looking up towards the ceilings and the lights. No glasses but for readers for books and computer work. Night driving was getting really bad with the glare from the scattering of the light due to the lens clouding up. It was almost light driving in a white out snowstorm at times, especially with these ultra-bright headlights people seem to think they need, but only blind everyone else. Anyway, to each their own...I got my eyes examined and they confirmed the cataracts in both eyes. Right was worse than left, but both were bad. In the glare test, it looking like I was looking through dense cobwebs and everything got washed out such that I could not hardly even see the chart on the wall. It was definitely time to get something done.I decided to go with the Panoptix Toriq IOLs for both eyes. I am still ""relatively"" young and wanted to be as free from needing glasses as possible. I only used readers, so didn't like the option of requiring glasses all the time, and the trifocals seemed to offer a lot of benefits. I scheduled the surgeries 1 week apart, starting with the left eye.I won't go in to the pre-op stuff, as I am a big whimp when it comes to people messing with my eyes. I will say that I should NOT have watched all of the Youtube video showing the procedure as all it did was freaked me out, and I am a pretty level headed guy... Procedures went well. I had the laser assisted procedure, and the Versed did it's job well so I remember very little.Healing has been non-problematic. I have followed all of the instructions for using the eye shield for 1 week after each eye procedure, and application of the eye drops per orders. I am now 2 weeks out from the right eye and 1 week out from the left eye.Vision in both eyes is INCREDIBLE at all distances from about 10"" to infinity. I do have moments of blurryness, but the doctor told me that is to be expected. The biggest thing for me was colors, and more specifically WHITE. Before the surgery, all whites looked off-white. When I opened my right eye after remioing the dressing from the first surgery, even though everything was milky and cloudy the whites really popped. I had to do the cover one then the other to take in the difference. I thought that was really interested.Both eyes are now mostly clear. 95% non-blurry with short little stints of slight blurriness, mostly right after waking up and just for just a few minutes. All colors are much more vivid now across the board. I can see perfectly at all distances. I work A LOT on the computer all day, and no longer need any glasses at all.Now for the down side. The concentric circles of light around each light source is currently TERRIBLE. It is the Christmas season, and every little light on the Christmas tree is surrounds by 3-5 concentric circles. Go outside at night, bright stars, street lamps, overhead airplanes; anything with a defined central light source has the rings. Now, picture that in your mind, now put yourself behind the wheel of a car with a string of opposing rush hour traffic vehicles and all of the headlights, with each headlight with those concentric rings of lights. For me, it is terrible. There is no better way for me to describe it. I knew from my pre-op research and lens selection that there was chance for this, but read that the halos were minimal; but wholly buckets... I brought this up to my surgeon and he confirmed that it was not uncommon, but that it should progresssively improve. Like I said before, I am only 1 & 2 weeks out from the implantation of the lenses, so I am hoping for the best.Bottom line : Vision is now great, as I can see pretty much at all distances. The rings of light stink. If I were asked the marketing question ""Would you do these Panoptix lenses again?"", with the assumption that the rings of light will not go away, I would have to say definitely not as it is that bad. Ask me again in 1/3/6/12/24 months, and if things have improved as my surgeon says that they may, my answer may change.Definitely take my comments of regret with a grain of salt given the short time that has elapsed. I am hoping for better results longterm, but I just do not understand how the brain can ""adjust"" for this... Someone explained it to me like the frames of glasses. After you wear glasses for awhile, your brain tunes out the frames and you do not notice them. That I totally understand as they are always in the same place. But with the circles, they are always moving in relationship to the light sources, so not sure ow the brain can adapt to that, when the rings are being introduced by the edges present on the trifocal IOLs. Hopefully I am missing something and things will improve in this area, as I really want to love these things.I hope that this helps others. I will try and update as I have more time with the lenses and report on if things are improving for the rings of light."
Cataract,IC-8 Small Aperture IOL - Experience? Availability,"I have read about a new type of IOL in the development stream that uses a small aperture to increase the focus depth of field. It appears to solve some of the issues associated with the existing multi focus and EDOF lenses. It seems that it has the US FDA approval for trials, but has not been released in North America for consumer use? Information about it seems to mainly come from Australia and Europe. This article has some information on it:**The IC-8 IOL: Big Advantages Through Small Apertures The Ophthalmologist **Is there anyone here that has experience with it, or thoughts on how well it may work. My second eye is probably 2 years away, so I am wondering if it might be a candidate for the near focus lens in a monovision solution if it is available by then. I am also thinking it may be a better fit for those younger than my 70 years. One double edged sword benefit of older age is that our pupil size decreases and as a result our depth of focus increases due to the pinhole camera effect similar to how this small aperture IOL. Perhaps it is just a way of artificially aging the eyes of younger people!"
Cataract,Changes in eyes AFTER Lens Exchange,"Hi,I wanted to start this subject to check experiences/knowledge in the matter.In my example :hyperopic with astigmatism +5, -2 --> 0 after Lasik --> +3, -1,5 after 9 years --> now(10 more years) +6, -2,25If lens exchange ? will the changes in eye stop ? Are the changes to hyperopic/astigmatism from Lens, Cornea or other components in eye ?Anyone knows ?And also for the ones (most) with similar myopia changes...?Appreciate any insight.It could be good with some knowledge in the long term planning.~Swede~"
Cataract,Do you think I should take (legal?) action for (minor?) issue?,"I had an IOL put in June '19 and I complained to my doctor right away of cloudy vision, asymmetric glare (on right side only) and a few other issues. Over the three month period of follow-ups, he regularly told me that everything ""looked fine"" and sent me on my way. He did not even dilate me to examine me thoroughly. It was always a quick glance through the slit lamp, nothing more. At one point, I remember him shrugging at my questions: ""If everything is fine, why do I have these issues? "" And he shrugged and said, ""Just unlucky, I guess."" It was as if he did not want to be bothered with me.Last month, I saw a new doctor who examined me and said that my symptoms are being causes by PCO and a wrinkle on one side of my capsule, both of which he says can be easily fixed with a YAG. He printed photos for me so that I could see the capsule for myself and sent a letter to the first doctor -- and you could tell that he was baffled by the first doctor's behavior.I am very upset about the treatment of the first doctor. Yes, the solution is simple, but I feel like this is grounds for some kind of action, as it forced me to pay money for second opinion and caused me a lot of distress. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? I know it's simple and minor and more of annoyance, it sill cost me money and time. Even if a lawyer probably wouldn't take the case, do you think there's anything I can do to get some sort of compensation from the first doctor?"
Cataract,Update Trifocal and edof mix,"I had eyes checked last week, 9 weeks after Lara edof implant, 4 weeks after Lisa trifocal implant.Both lenses are toric 3.0I have no pco, although I learned something new. Pco is not an on/off thing, it is normal to have slightly capsular opacification after implant, in both eyes I had what everyone has she said. She pointed to the matte desk pad under her keyboard and said, that is how it looks to me, if it needs fixing.Anyway, with no pco I guess my result is a relative good comparison of the two lenses, even that results will always vary from person to person, but off course I can only judge from my own result.Some keywords:Edof have more visual side effects than trifocalEdof have worse near vision than trifocalEdof and trifocal have same intermediate vision capabilityEdof is slightly ""thicker"" at intermediate but trifocal is slightly more sharpEdof and trifocal have same far visionNightvision is similar, but much bigger starburst and much bigger concentric rings from edof.Night vision is generally goodContrast looks very similar, trifocal have marginally more color and trifocal white is marginally more whiteBefore surgery my ""edof eye"" was dominant eye, but now the trifocal eye have become dominant.I notice no soft spots with the trifocal, i feel continuous vision from far to 14"", with two trifocals I guess it would work well even closer than that.So, is edof a bad iol? No, I think it works very well, but when I compare the two, the trifocal is just a bit better, because it offers better near vision, and have less visual side effects."
Cataract,Chronic eye pain following cataract surgry,"Hello,it's been 1.5 years since surgery and beside positive dysphotopsia, I am suffering from chronic eye pain. There's no dry eye syndrome. No other objective reasons. I just feel constant pain in that eye, I do ""feel"" the IOL inside and it's a kind of constant preassure or tickling. Or just pain to make it simple. Any thoughts?"
Cataract,Is there an IOL with less positive disphotopsia than Tecnis?,Is there an IOL with less positive disphotopsia than Tecnis? My doctor said that there is not a better lens to replace mine with . (I'm facing the prospect of not driving at night again or risking mine or other lives! )
Cataract,Disabling glare 5 months after cataract surgery,"I had cataract surgery in both eyes in September of 2019 my lenses are single vision set for distance in one eye and reading in the other . I have had disabling glare at night that prevents me from driving . I feel like a shut in . My doctor said that i have the best lens to prevent glare and halos and that there is not a lens that would be better to exchange to . Positive Disphotopsia is what its called .I've tried Pilocarpne Hydrochloride drops but this has not really helped, Dr said Yag might help but no guarentees. I dont want to have the Yag because it might limit any future lens exchange. I wonder if its possible to exchange a lense if a new one was available years away? Is there a doc in the US or even in another country that specializes in correcting this?"
Cataract,Exchange or PRK?,"I've used glasses since I was 3 years old and readers since lasik 18 years ago, so I'm used to having readers in my car and all the rooms in my house that I would need them. Three months ago I had a Symfony IOL implanted in my LE, (RE doesn't yet need cataract surgery). It resulted in bad halos and concentric lines around bright lights when outside at night, which was very uncomfortable when driving. Also, after healing I had astigmatism of -1.25 and a bit farsightedness of +.25. I tried prescription glasses that corrected for those and also had anti glare. Still had the same halos/concentric lines. Everything else looked and felt good.My appointment with the surgeon is in a couple weeks. The choices are PRK or exchange, where I would get a mono-focal toric IOL set to distance. With PRK I would still have the bad halos and concentric lines. I do a lot of sports and like having good distance vision. My doctor thought I would be happier with the exchange but I have many questions to ask at my next appointment. He indicated that he would not charge for either.Anyone had an exchange... how did it work out? PRK.... how did it work out?"
Cataract,IOL Exchange: POSITIVE Dysphotopsia,"Hello,I'd like to start a new thread ONLY for people suffering from POSITIVE Dysphotopsia.Please share your story, tell us what IOL type and brand you have and whether you consider IOL Exchange procedure.My case:Tecnis 1-piece monofocal ZCB00, 2 years ago, terrible positive dysphotopsia including glare halos starburst and pretty much everything. I am scared of exchange, but am getting more and more desperate. Addicted to Pilocarpine since one month post op in order to alleviate the sympthoms. No PCO, perfectly located and everything is ""perfect"" like they always say."
Cataract,Diminished night vision,"I just had my right eye done with the Panoptix trifocal lens 4 days ago. My night vision is worse than it was with cataracts. i know it has only been 4 days and my eye has not fully adjusted, but I am afraid I am going to get into an accident. I've read that yellow night vision glasses help. I have also read just the opposite, that they make it worse. i have also read that wearing prescription lenses at night help. I don't know what to do. I am scheduled to have my left eye done in two weeks. I tead someone else say make the left eye mono focal. I am looking to see if the night vision gets better, or if it is what it is."
Cataract,Monofocal set for near (how is your arms-length vision when wearing glasses for driving?),"If you have a monofocal IOL set for near and wear glasses during the day to help see distant objects (like when driving a car or watching movies) how good is your intermediate vision while wearing these glasses? I'm very interested to know if I get a monofocal set for near and wear glasses during the day if I could realistically work at a computer for hours without being uncomfortable? My computer screen sits about 30-40"" away from me (which, in optical terms, equates to a lens distance of about -1.25 to -1.0 D). I imagine if I had a near IOL it would be set somewhere around -2.0 D.To provide more context, I'm trying to decide what IOL to pick for my dominant right eye (cataract is becoming very symptomatic and will need surgery soon). My non-dominant left eye already has a multifocal IOL which gives me 2 focus points at -4.25D and -1.75D. The multifocal has horrible side effects though so I've decided I must pick a monofocal for my dominant eye. I work at a computer all day long and love using my iPhone & near vision quite frequently. I also thought about maybe going with a distance vision IOL but I'm worried the difference in diopters would be too large between my eyes. I've basically narrowed it down to either a near IOL (set to around -2.0 D) or an intermediate IOL (set to around -1.0 D) in my dominant eye are the best choices.Any thoughts or experience that could help with this decision is greatly appreciated! I'm also 30 years old with a high possibility of becoming more myopic with time (which makes me think the intermediate choice might be better considering it could shift over time)"
Cataract,Can no longer see well intermediate without glasses after cataract surgery. Would like opinion,"I have 2 questions. One has to do with vision change and the other is about how they determine you no longer need drops after cataract surgery.I am 78 and had cataract surgery at Critical Care Clinic at a hospital (right eye Oct 16/2019 and left eye Nov 13/2019. I have open angle glaucoma and macular hole in my left eye and exfoliation (developed just before cataract surgery) glaucoma in my right eye. I had vision correction laser PRK back in 2001 which made it difficult for exact measurements. The doctor recommended lenses for distance for the left eye and intermediate for the right eye. At first, my intermediate was very good and but gradually has decreased and at my next visual test appointment I was told my eyes now are both for distance 20/30. Although I'm very glad I had no complications, I am very disappointed that I'm still left struggling with 2 sets of glasses (for reading and pc). Even if I have a bit better vision, they're still glasses.My vision laser doctor had made my dominant eye (right eye) for distance which gave me full monovision. This time, because of the exfoliation in the right eye which I developed just before the cataract surgery which made it the weaker eye now so the cataract doctor chose to do this eye first but chose to make it intermediate and made my left eye for distance -- the reverse of what I had before. Wouldn't it have been better to make my right eye for distance like I had it before? What I think happened is that because my right eye is dominant and was for distance for many years, it has now taken over for distance and so I lost my intermediate. I just want to know if anyone would be of the same opinion as myself. The weird thing is I can still see the text on my pc without glasses but a bit blurry and not comfortable. It's frustrating because it's there, but just not good enough and I can't have it, grrrrrrr. We were vying for glasses for reading only which was ok with me.Also would like to know if anyone knows how the experts determine a person doesn't need glaucoma drops anymore or a lower dose. Cataract surgery can sometimes release pressure. Do they go by the numbers of the pressure, e.g., I understand that 24 is high? Or just stop the drops altogether, wait a couple of months, check your eyes, and determine from that whether you still need them? Sorry for the length of this."
Cataract,Eye pain after YAG laser capsulotomy ,"I had YAG laser capsulotomy 3 days ago and since then, i have experienced pain in my left eye, which feels like a splinter inside the eye. After visiting my doctor, i have been told i have scratches on my cornea in both eyes (left more severe than right). Has anyone experienced similar symptoms as my eye surgeon is stating that it is nothing to do with the YAG procedure and he has never seen this before?"
Cataract,Do measurements for surgery/IOL need to be done again? ,"Hi! I had my measurements for cataract surgery done in November 2018. I left my contacts out for two weeks...15 days for good measure...and endured the extensive measuring by a highly rated surgeon I plan to use in the Philadelphia area. I say endured bc the bright lights for a few of the tests were honestly painful. I have very light sensitive eyes and my pupils dilate very easy. I put off surgery for a few reasons - and upcoming vacation, then the surgeon had a change in schedule that didn't fit mine, and then in August I decided to wait for Panoptix, Now my LE is getting pretty cloudy and I'm trying to get the nerve to do the surgery.My surgeon said the measurements from 2018 are still good and I don't need to re-do them. Anyone know? Is there a benefit to do them again? My vision hasn't changed other than the cataracts.BTW - my glasses script is -9.0. Contacts -7.5.Thanks in advance for your expert opinions ?"
Cataract,Anyone had LASIK/PRK for small touch-up after EDOF IOL implant?,"I had Symfony lenses implanted a year ago and have had YAG... where I am now is that I have one eye at plano (0.0), but the other has a small +0.5 error with a -0.5 astigmatism.This might not seem like much - and it isn't too noticable at far distance like road signs. However, indoors, with the TV, computer, smartphone, and reading, it's progressively more noticable the closer you get - I cannot read a book or smartphone with that eye alone, but with both eyes I can.Essentially it seems like the EDOF benefit is cancelled in that worse eye. It's livable, but the imbalance bothers me daily - if I attempt to sit and read a book or newspaper the worse eye waters and it's just uncomfortable.I'm trying to decide if it's worth doing PRK. I tried on a trial pair of glasses with a corrective lens to simulate the result and it does fix the symptoms I'm having - it's exactly what I'm wanting.So I'm wondering if anyone else has done laser touchups for small corrections like this and if they were satisfied with the results?"
Cataract,TECNIS SYMFONY LENS implanted in someone in their 20s.,"Hi all,I'm trying my best to avoid any sort of paranoia as its only been 2 DAYS after a tecnis symfony lens implantation on my right eye, but I can not helped but be concerned by simply two major issues.I can not see further than 20 inches away from me. Only near vision is clear. Had a follow up appointment to test if I could read BIG words on a monitor about 5 feet away from me. I failed EVERY test.When I am looking/reading something within this near vision range, when I move my eyes, there is a jitter/wiggle that distorts my vision for a split second. My guess is that it is the lens not fully formed to the eye yet.Am I being too impatient? Is this normal? Has anyone experienced this within their first two days?"
Cataract,Fitting range of AcrySof IQ Toric IOL,"Hi, I'm 70 years old and getting prepared for my first cataract surgery pre-op appointment. And, I am trying to get up to speed on what my choices might be for a replacement lens. Over the years my eyeglass prescriptions for this eye have been in the -3 to -4 range with astigmatism for the last 20 years or so (as best I can remember. And for a long time I have been getting a +2.5 add for reading. I have used contacts on and off, and have more recently mainly been using progressives. Here are some old as well as the more recent corrections, which indicate my eyes have been changing and actually getting significantly better for distance, up until very recently with the cataract diagnosis.My initial investigations have led me towards a distance distance only toric solution. My first priority is image quality and I am not against wearing glasses. And, I will have to anyway until my second eye is done. I have close to 20/20 in it now, so I don't know how far in the future that will be.So my question is about whether or not these AcrySof IQ Toric IOL's are suitable. Does it look like my correction needs can be accommodated by these lenses? This is what I see from one reference I found for this.I am thinking that my last prescription which was made to try and correct for the mess the cataract has made, has to be ignored, and my needs are more based on what I had before the cataract came into the picture.

Cataract,Accommodating vs multifocal/tri lenses for younger person,"Hello all. I have been trying to do a lot of research on the different lenses but it is hard finding how younger people are doing with the lenses vs the older people whos eyes may react differently to the more premium lenses. I am 30yrs old. Ended up with fast developing cataracts in both eyes. Had PRK/Lasik in late 2017. No cataracts present. A couple months ago my vision at a distance started getting blurry. Like I was always in a haze. Then within 2 weeks the vision in my left eye went from a little blurry at a distance to full on mature cataracts where everything is extremely blurry and I can just barely make out shapes up close. My right eye is slowly following the same signs the left had. I had a cataracts evaluation exam last week and was not happy with how it went. None of the machines could get light pass my lens for accurate measurements besides with a CT scan. The surgeon seemed very unsure of his abilities outside of a normal cataracts situation and heavily pushed the mono lens due to no accurate measurements. When I asked if he could just request all my exam information I had for my PRK surgery several years back, he did not want to and just wanted to go his route. Which I found extremely odd and so did my eye doctor who referred me to him. I scheduled another exam for a 2nd opinion from the surgeon who did my PRK and it isn't until Feb 12th. With high hopes of surgery by Feb 20th. My main thing is I want to stay away from glasses and contacts as much as possible. I paid around $5500 2yrs ago to not have to wear either... And I do a lot of driving and computer use. As well as plenty of use on my phone. I am wondering if the accommodating lens option would be best over the tri lenses since it relies on your eye muscles to flex the lens for adjustments and my eyes are still young and should handle that fine. The tri lenses my eye doctor said people have complained that it's like watching a baseball game through a chain link fence. You can see the game fine, but it seems like something is there in the way in the middle at all times. And if a bird lands on the fence, you see that clearly, but now the game is slightly blurred. And none of the 3 distances is really clear, just ""good"". Iv also wondered about 2 different types of accommodating lenses like 1 that is for distance and mid range and the other for distance and near. If that would be small enough to not notice anything negative vs the 2 different mono lenses one for distance and one for near... Any thoughts? Sorry for the Hello all.

Cataract,What to expect in first cataract appointment?,"I would be interested to know what happens in the first appointment in preparation for cataract surgery. I am in Alberta, Canada, and with our health care system have waited nearly 10 months for this first consultation appointment. My appointment is for Feb 3, and I had a short discussion with the surgeon's secretary. She said it was a vision test and complete eye exam that would last about 90 minutes. Must be more than just a routine eye exam, based on time alone. I also asked how long it would be until the surgery. I was told it would be about 6 months! So I have waited 10 months to be put on another waiting list of 6 months. Still I find it hard to complain, as I am sure there are many others on the list that have issues with both eyes and have more vision loss than I do. I see very clearly with my currently non cataract eye, but not too good with my bad eye.So for those who have been through this, what can I expect? I'm sure I have to make the decision as to whether or not I go ahead with the surgery, and that is a definite yes for me. Not hard to make that one. But, is it likely I will have to commit to a specific lens at this point, or does that come later? I am thinking that if I opt for a premium lens, like I intend to, there will be more measurements to be taken much closer to the actual surgery time? And, I also wonder if I can use this 6 month waiting period to change my mind?Any thoughts appreciated. I would like to be well prepared for this first consult."
Cataract,Has Anyone Tried Crossed Monovision?,"Crossed monovision is when the non dominant eye is corrected for monofocal distance, and the dominant eye is corrected to mini-monovision. My surgeon is suggesting I consider it when I get to the point my second cataract surgery is necessary. On a search I have found some reports on a study of 60 people which found it to be as effective as standard monovision. One report is titled:Crossed monovision may be as effective as conventional monovisionI am curious how popular it really is, and what personal experiences may be?"
Cataract,Advice needed on Monofocal Distance vs Monovision IOL Alternatives,"My thoughts are evolving on my upcoming decision on what to get for an IOL in my cataract surgery. Some background again:I have seriously considered a multifocal type IOL like the AcrySof IQ PanOptix. But, frankly the potential adverse effects are scaring me away from it. I am a bit of a perfectionist and I don't think I would be happy living with less than perfect vision, especially at night.My current thinking is to go with the AcrySof IQ Toric. There seems to be no downside to a toric lens other than cost. Again, with my perfectionist tendencies, going with the toric lens seems like the easy choice providing it is suitable for my particular astigmatism.Now for the difficult part. Do I ask for a full distance correction? Or should I compromise that correction to get some reasonable near vision with this non dominant eye? This is a technique I have used in the past with contacts. Here is the prescription I had for this eye before the cataract, for glasses and with a a contact for monovision.Correction type, Spherical, Cylindrical, AxisEyeglasses, -2.0, -1.5, 114Contacts, -0.75, -1.25, 110I recall I tried a few different options and settled on this one which essentially gave me a -1.25 under correction of my right non dominant eye. I recall it was pretty good during the day, but less so at night. In retrospect, I don't know how much of that night issue was due to the monovision and how much was just due to using contacts which are not stable in the eye and do not correct as well as eyeglasses. I recall I could read with this configuration as long as it was not real fine print. And for anything close up seriously small I still needed reading glasses help.I do some target and sport shooting with a scope and am right handed, so this is they eye I need to use. I guess to some degree I could compensate for this under correction with my scope focus. Or, I would have to get shooting glasses.So, especially for those with monovision experience, what do you think? It is an all or nothing choice. My right eye is so seriously messed up now, there is no opportunity to experiment with this using contacts now. The other choice of course is to go with distance monofocal with this eye and both eventually, and resolve to use reading glasses. I don't find that outcome intolerable either. It would reduce my ongoing eyeglass costs to OTC readers."
Cataract,Has anyone had Perfect vision after Multifocal IOLs surgery’- please share experience ,"i am reading about alot of issues after surgery which result in unwanted side affects which remain for the rest of life such as halos, starbursts etc. We are told that these are not common and tend to disappear over time. Would be good to hear about positive outcomes"
Cataract,Glossary?,"I have just joined this group, as I am due to have my cataract assessment appointment this week with surgery next week. I have been looking through the messages, but I don't understand most of them! Is there somewhere I can look to understand all the initials and all the jargon?Thanks in advance"
Cataract,Experience after monovision with monofocus cataract surgery,"Hi,I just want to share my experience after undergoing cataract surgery five days ago.After several rounds of uncertainty about what type of lens I should opt for, I decided to go for a ""light"" monovision solution, using monofocal IOL's.The surgeon originally recommended Alcon Vivity, which is a new type of EDOF, which claims to improve, or completely eradicate many of the side-effects of earlier generation EDOF's. The lens was launched in November 2019 and my surgeon claims that it is the first EDOF that really delivers on the promise of near monofocal optical performance, coupled with glasses-free vision down to close, intermediate distance.Unfortunately, Vivity was not available for my level of myopia, and the choice then fell between monofocals, or tri-focals. In my case, Alcon Panoptix was the tri-focal on offer.After thinking quite hard about the choice, I decided that lack of visual artifacts and best possible low-light performance were more important to me than being completely glasses-free, and I opted for the monovision solution, with my left (non-dominant) eye focussed at +1 to +1.25, relative to the dominant eye, which was corrected for distance.Five days on, I am generally extremely pleased with the result. I now have hawk-like long distance vision, already with very little aberration - no rings and almost no starburst or ""fog"". My right eye is crystal clear at distance, with just a slight softening of the image from the left.The intention was that monovision should give me good focus at PC screen distance, with usable reading performance if I held the material a little away from my eyes, and on day one after the operation, it did indeed seem that this would be the case. However, as the slight post-operative swelling has reduced, focus has shifted further away for both eyes, so that I do now need +1 glasses for screen-work and slightly more for closer reading.Even wearing the +1's, my distance vision is approaching my earlier experience from properly corrected (with glasses) myopia, so for many myopics, a slighly softer IOL correction may well be more than good enough, reducing the need for + glasses in every-day situations and offering good-enough distance vision, which can easily be corrected further with a pair of -1's in situations that demand perfect long-distance vision. This corresponds to advice from my surgeon, who told me that myopics generally prefer slight under-correction and that he aims for this when choosing IOL's for this patient group.I believe that an exact measurement of the necessary strength of IOL's is difficult and that there will always be a margin of error, compared with prescriptions for glasses or contact lenses.I am informed that, should I be dissatisfied with the result, I can opt for an additional, corrective tri-focal lens implant in a year, to completely correct my vision, and that the side effects of this, double solution will be comparable to an Alcon Panoptix, single IOL. This solution in both eyes would cost the same as the surcharge for tri-focal IOL's last week.One option to minimise artefacts might be to opt for this in my left eye only. However, it is still very early days and I am certainly enjoying the overall clarity of my vision, which can only improve even further over the next couple of months. I do not feel that the need for work/reading glasses will pose any significant problems and will post occasional updates here as my post-op sight further develops."
Cataract,Need advice on IOL selection process...,"I am 70 years old and was diagnosed with a cataract in my right eye (non dominant) nearly a year ago. My vision in my left dominant eye is still excellent, but my optometrist says I can expect to get a cataract in it too at some point. I am moderately myopic and have had a +2.5 add for reading for a long time. Long wait in my area of Canada (Alberta) to get an appointment with a surgeon, but I will have my first pre-op consultation a week from now. I did a bunch of research into my options when first diagnosed and then let it slide. Now push is coming to shove, and I will have to make a decision. For those who have been through this I would be interested in getting some advice as to whether I am thinking this through properly and if there are options I should be considering that I am not. Although I will have to pay for anything over the cost of a basic lens out of pocket, cost is not an issue I worry about.For needs, I drive, some sports. I use contacts for snorkeling. I do some shooting and target shooting with my right eye (which now has the cataract), and really want excellent distance vision. With age I have found driving at night more and more difficult, and I also want excellent night vision for driving. I have tried monovision with contacts, but gave up on it. Partly it was because I really don't like contacts, even though I have been wearing them on and off since 1975. But the main reason was I did not at all like the night vision and flaring of light I was getting from it. I was afraid to drive with my contacts at night, even though my day vision was excellent. While it would be nice to be glasses free, to me excellent vision is a higher priority. I use the computer a lot, and my progressive eyeglasses work very well for me to do that.So, what do I do? I have a friend who went the multifocal route and she likes it. She says she can do most things without glasses except for reading small print on OTC drug labels and the like. She uses readers for that. She is also adverse to wearing glasses. My thoughts are that this is not me. While I would like to be glasses free, I also want as perfect vision as possible for both reading and distance. This has lead me to think a lens that corrects for distance only is the best route for me. I have some astigmatism and I expect I would also benefit from a toric lens to correct for astigmatism. My research to date has indicated the most popular choice for this type of lens is the AcrySoft IQ Toric IOL. It is claimed to be the most stable in position and easiest to locate correctly. The negatives I have seen on it is the issue of glistenings. But, that seems to have been addressed with improved manufacturing quality control -- or at least the mfg claims that.So, for those that have been through this, what do you think? Is this thinking sound? Alternative that I have overlooked? Other factors I should consider?"

Cataract,Black rim at corner of eye after cataract surgury,"I had my right eye operated for cataract a month ago, ever since I took the patch off the next day after the operation, there has been this thin back rim at the far end corner of my eye. The doctor who operated me assured me the surgery went well and he saw nothing wrong, and if there is, there is nothing he can do. Went to another doctor, she said it may be due to the small pupils I have and how my retinal is, says I will notice it less eventually. Went to to a third doctor, he said it happens when the IOLs are acrylic, but will not do anything about it since my vision is 20/20 after the operation, He said he can operate my other eye and use a PMMA iol instead, he also added that PMMA lens are not foldable as acrylic lens, therefore he will need to make a bigger incision. I don't know what to believe and I am scared to have my other eye operated. I hope someone in this board can shed some insight on my case.

I am in the US and am under Medicare and a good supplemental insurance. 
Cataract,getting second opinion on iol position,"So I have a Symfony IOL in one eye so far. I am supposed to get another one, but I made the decision to wait and find a new doctor.Long story short, while I have good vision, I suspect my IOL is not positioned well. I think it is tilted, causing things like ghosting and a few other issues. My original surgeon, for whatever reason, would not check for this. I was baffled by my post-op care, tbh. I would mention, ""Hey could you check the position of this IOL?"" and he would be like, ""Yeah. Looks great. See you next month."" He would not dilate my eye to check.After three months of weirdness with his doc, I asked for my patient file and made an appointment with a fairly renown surgeon who I am fortunate enough to live close to. I am seeing him soon.My question is, Anyone out there deal with IOL tilt issues? When I go in to this appointment, what should I say to properly convey my concerns and what should I expect from the exam?"
Cataract,Extreme Light Sensitivity After Cataract Surgery.,"Right after having cataract surgery about six months ago everything was super bright - Artificial lighting in stores almost seems like it's burning and sometimes makes me dizzy. It's almost like I can't think, it's messing with my brain. At times it is intolerable. By the end of the day the collective eyestrain has my eyes mostly shut and I've learned to live in as dark of an environment as possible. Even sunlight coming through a window can be problematic. I also get the flickering at times that other people and myself have posted about.I had a concussion from a blow above my eye about three years ago. I'm 'only' 58 and that is what started the cataracts, but Dr. May, a neuro-opthamologist, did not think there was link to my current issues.I've seen lots of specialists, including Dr Randall Olsen at the John Moran Eye clinic in Salt Lake City. I can't recommend Dr Olsen highly enough, I don't think anyone is more qualified. He said my brain is working about 10 times harder than normal trying to adjust to the new light coming in and that out of the 3 million plus cataract surgeries done last year, there would only be 10 to 20 people, if that, with this condition. No doctor has more than a patients like this, so no study has been done. That diagnosis has since been confirmed by two really good specialists.Dr Olsen is the only one who has given a good scientific explanation of what is causing the flickering, dizzyness and eyestrain. I should have had a tape recorder on, most of it went over my head and it was much better info than I could find on the internet, despite a ton of research.The cure is exposure, hiding in the dark prevents recovery. The time frame for improvement may be 2-3 years. I gather those who did not expose themselves to more light did not recover. So, I've got the lights on ?There is no name for this that I know of, but that doesn't make it any less real.I am wondering about the recovery time frames of any other similarly afflicted victims that may have also come to this forum?"
Cataract,UK NHS experience anyone?,"I am due to have my first (left) cataract done on Wednesday, and went for my pre-op assessment last week. Having read all the posts on here about all the different options, and having also done some online research about what is available on the NHS or privately (which would be an option for me) I went in with a lot of questions, but was given no time to ask them.The nurse who did the measurements was extremely grumpy and didn't want to talk at all. At the time that didn't bother me as I wanted to talk to the consultant, but when I got to see her, it was very obvious that she wanted to ""process"" me as quickly as possible. She had a quick look at my eyes, asked which eye I wanted done first, told me what she would put in, which I didn't even catch beyond the word ""distance"" because she mumbled, then told me to sign the form and said goodbye. I did try asking about the option of multifocal lenses as she was ushering me towards the door, but she just said ""I wouldn't even talk to you about that because of your glaucoma, anyway I wouldn't have them at any price"" and that was the end of that.I know I should have been more assertive, but I am not good at that sort of thing and I didn't want to make her cross. All she had to do was ask ""have you got any questions?"" but she didn't, and there is so much I wanted to know. Silly things like:Can anyone help?"

Cataract,Correction of Hyperopia and Astigmatism with At Lisa,"Hi everyone,I finally decided to make a surgery on my eyes to permanently eliminate my addiction to glasses. I am 49 years old and have a strong hypertrophy +6 combined with an astigmatism of +1.5 RE 1.75 LE.In the beginning I wanted to implant the EDOF AT LARA but after reading experiences in this forum and and listening to the doctor who will operate me, I convinced myself (so to speak) to use the AT LISA but I do not hide my concern for the post intervention.The fact is that I have no cataract and with (progressive) glasses I see perfectly.It is only a desire to take off my glasses after 49 years.Your opinion would help me ... Based on your experience and the results obtained after the surgery (for those people who obviously have performed the same lens implant) do you think I am going to commit nonsense to operate?thanks all in advanceMirko"
Cataract,EDOF Zeiss At Lara,So I am looking at this lens as it is apparently the best EDOF out there and was wondering...What is the advantage of having such a rectangular haptic? I mean the rectangular part that extends out from the circular lens part? Seems like will be headache to fit it in the eye capsule?Why does it have those 2 holes in the normal version and 4 in the toric version?Those holes seem like welcome entry doors for PCO cells to move around in the capsule bag?
Cataract,Cataract follow up - Why can't doctors be empathetic?,"I can't thank this community enough which helped me ask right questions in my last week appointment with two follow up doctors for second and third opinion.BackgroundRD in left eye with poor vision, 4 / 60. Cataract in right eye has progressed a bit limiting my night driving and activities because of reduced contrast sensitivity and glare & halos from car headlights & streetlights.Problems I am dealing with currently:Doctor XSuper happy with how the whole 30 minutes conversation went. The doctor was very empathetic and listened to every questions I had. He told that eyes become more myopic after RD surgery. That's the reason why left eye appears slightly bigger than the right one. The minor squint in the bad eye is because of difference in vision. Unfortunately, nothing can be done to fix these two problems.I asked about the risk of RD post cataract surgery. He said that the risk is very slim given the health of retina.Doctor YVery over hyped and had a very bad experience. He didn't even make eye contact. The whole conversation was over in a minute. Looks like he got p****d off that I won't get surgery done there. He recommended monofocal with intermediate and distance correction.All three doctors have recommended to get the cataract surgery done. Looks like there is no escape from it. Multifocal is not an option for me.QuestionsAs always, thanks for all your help."

Cataract,cPain after Cataract surgery,ever since surgery i have had ache and at times pain in my eyes. Doctor keeps telling me i am healing well. Is this possibly due to dry eye and chronic sinusitis? The pain has traveled into my cheekbone at times. can be quite uncomfortable. Left eye done Nov 18th. Right eye Dec 11. Any input would be greatly appreciated.
Cataract,Flickering light after cataract surgery,"I have seen a few discussions about this, but I was wondering...of those who saw this subside, how long did it take? Days, weeks, months?

Cataract,Valid reason for Yag laser capsulotomy ?,"Hi,I had IOL transplants a couple of years ago. Now I am having a problem which is a bit difficult to describe. It is something akin to double vision especially when driving. I'm ok (other than depth perception) closing either eye, but with both open, it is like they are not working together, as I said, something like double vision. Not blurred vision .The ophthalmologist that did the surgery has told me repeatedly I have dry eyes, and today again said that is a possible cause. I accept that - lubricant helps a little. But he also said I need this laser treatment for ""dirty"" capsules and in both eyes, and very quickly showed me the ""dirty"" part on the equipment monitor. Now ""dirty"" could have been a poor translation for ""cloudy"". English is not his native language but it did not look cloudy or dirty to me in the second or two I looked at it. My bad - I should have spent more time on that but ya'll know what it is like in the office. When pressed how sure he was, he said 80%. I have not come across anything that suggests this procedure for this problem, only for blurred vision, so I am asking here.I'm a bit suspicious because this is a for-profit hospital in Thailand (where I live) and it is somewhat notorious for let's say, maximizing that profit whenever possible. Informed opinions would be much appreciated. Also of course from anyone else that has experienced this specific problem."
Cataract,Floating Cloud in Vision (Darts around when I move my eye),"I’m kind of having a panic attack over a new condition that recently started in my left eye. This eye has a history of cataract surgery (2007), YAG laser (2013), and PP Vitrectomy (2013). I went to see my ophthalmologist about this new issue yesterday but he said everything looks fine & he doesn’t see any floaters in the eye. I’m not even sure if what I’m experiencing is technically a floater or not but basically there’s a fuzzy cloud in my eye that darts around whenever I move my eye. It’s a very disturbing sensation and at times feels like my vision is jittering or twitching whenever I move the eye around. I think the jittering sensation might just be because the cloudy substance moves so quickly that it creates the illusion of moving/vibrating vision but I could be wrong...Basically when I look forward (staring ahead with no eye movements) I don’t notice any cloud or issue with the eye but whenever I look to the right a cloud appears & darts to the left (opposing the direction of eye movement into my peripheral vision). I will admit this problem has happened before (immediately after YAG laser in 2013) but it went away after 2 days or so. It’s been a long time since my eye behaved like this (and thankfully I know it went away before) so hopefully it’ll go away on its own after some more time. I’m just scared it’ll be permanent this time & the fact the Doctor couldn’t see anything when I was dilated bothers me. Has anyone experienced something similar or have any words of wisdom for a soon father-to-be worried about his future?"
Cataract,IOL procedure ,"Hi guys,Wondering if anyone has had the IOL lenses surgery to correct their vision? I have myopia and astigmatism since i was 5 years, I'm not candidate for Lasik as my cornea is too thin but i was advised i could have IOL lenses inserted instead. All the research i've done on it shows that it is mostly used for cataracts so im wondering if anyone has done to correct anything other than cataracts and also how much was the procedure?"
Cataract,"correcting for near vision, not distance","I was set on being corrected for near vision with cataract surgery as I've been nearsighted my whole life, and I seem to remember reading posts of people who became very frustrated at suddenly experiencing the opposite - not being able to see near and having to put on glasses for every little thing - except I don't mind wearing glasses anyway ... I have heard of mini monovision but I'm thinking more of both eyes for same. Does anyone have any feedback on nearsighed people being corrected for good near vision vs. good distance vision ? Thanks"

(Recall #Z2857-2016, Event #75051) These lenses (about 737) were NOT properly checked prior to distribution.

Cataract,Blurry floater a year after cataract surgery ,Yesterday as i was sitting on my patio I noticed a blurry cloud cross line of vision in my left eye. This continued throughout the day.

Cataract,Has anyone had any experience with IC-8 lens,**i had an eyehance lens in right eye in october. it has been great can see distance again. tried IC_8 in second eye for a chance at near and far vision. am seeing haloes around all lights at night. they are mostly ragged circles a bit like ring around saturn. Dr says that the lens in the right eye is clear. but says the lens in the left eye is cloudy. Dr not very helpful at all. not sure whether night vision problem is from cloudy lens or the IOL
Cataract,"Questions about Toric Lenses, Monofocals and Dry Eye suggestions","Hello,My name is Jorge. I am 61 and other than the cataract, I have no health issues that I know about and am on no meds. I stay away from fluoridated and chlorinated water by distilling my water and take whole food based supplements/vitamins. I eat organic almost exclusively whenever possible.I have been following some of the threads on here for years and have gotten to the point where I need to act. I don’t think I have written before (and if I did, it was not extensive) because everyone here seems to have done much more research than I had/have and I felt that I could not add much to the conversations. I was frankly embarrassed (and still am) for not having done more research on my own. To be honest, I don’t know what I don’t know and need guidance regarding what I should consider important and or relevant to my case.I have been told by my soon to be ex—prospective surgeon (more on that later) that the panoptix topic lens that was just approved is not recommended for photographers and those who work with subtle color changes and detailed work with subtle contrast differences. I have therefore decided to go with monofocals and deal with glasses for very short distances.I would like to ask and hope that some of you long-term users of both monofocals and multifocals can weigh in on your experiences regarding glare from the concentric rings and the color aspects.My vision has been deteriorating for about 6-7 years and I now find it difficult to read small print and I am sure that since this has been a gradual decline over years, that my vision in an absolute sense, is much worse than I realize. I am therefore wondering if since i have come to tolerate and deal with my vision up to this point, if the comparative differences between how it is today and how much better it will be with ANY lens, should be a factor in considering a toric lens. (I tend not to like any compromise and think that i would prefer no concentric ring glare from toric lenses with occasional glasses use to constant glare from point sources of light and hoping that my brain will learn to ignore them over time with only slightly less need for glasses along with the possibility of the reduced contrast and color differences).Dry eyes: Did any of you have your doctor test for dry eye? Did your doctor try to remedy that and tell you what was wrong?I went to a doctor who explained to me that my dry eye was being caused by MGD (Meibomian Gland Dysfunction). She then charged me an eye and a leg to get a heated eye massage as well as using a laser to help tread the MGD. Here are links to articles that discuss approaches:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4298157/I cannot find a reference to the laser she used but I am continuing to do the heated eye treatments with mask that heats uo the eyes and then I express the glands by gently rolling my fingers up to the eyelids.Why I am seeking another doctor to do my surgery:This doctor though seemingly experienced and competent/knowledgeable about the surgery, never once brought up dry eyes and when I brought it up, he told me that what he was going to be doing dealt with the inside of the eye so that dry eye would not affect it. While I can see how that might be accurate, I would think that a doctor should still try to get the eyes to be as healthy as possible before surgery and that was what another doctor (who I also let go) was trying to push prior to surgery. Your thoughts?My date for surgery was set when I remembered that as a former Lasik patient, I had read that there were some adjustments that were sometimes needed for cataract surgery patients who had had Lasik. When I brought this up with the gal who scheduled my surgery, she looked in my notes and confirmed that Lasik though noted, was never discussed with respect to surgery. She spoke to the doctor who said that he remembered seeing that I had had Lasik and “thought” he had gone over it with me. She informed him that according to the notes and myself, that he had not and had to reschedule surgery to a facility that had the newer lasers that could perform those procedures (I believe she called it ORB or something like that).So, the fact this doctor has overlooked things that I think are important, is prompting me to look for someone else.Can anyone who has had the Lasik and the subsequent adjustments to further accommodate for that, tell me what their experience was and if they would recommend it. I recall reading that some were actually against doing it for one reason or another.I am in Los Angeles, just in case some of you have a recommendation for a great doctor. Family is referring to a doctor in NY.Thank you very much,JorgeModerator comment: I have removed the link(s) directing to site(s) unsuitable for inclusion in the forums.

Cataract,Anyone get high ocular pressure immediately after cataract surgery?,
Cataract,Halos/haze with monofocal - looking for experiences,"Hi all,Just wondering if anyone has hazy cloud around lights with monofocal lens or lenses.Anybody know/heard what causes it?It's not the edge of the lens. It's not a negative dysphotopsia. It's not a multifocal or EDOF lens.The haze is sometimes just a cloud of color, and sometimes it has very closely spaced halo lines. There is a moving quality to the hazy space sometimes, like smoke in a beam of light. I call that effect ""lava lamp"" even though that's probably not what a lava lamp is.Occurs most with stoplights and brake lights.Thoughts/experiences/researched information are much appreciated!"
Cataract,"Inevitable cataract surgery, scared of different possibilities","Before I begin with my long story, I want to thank this group and amazing people who have been sharing their experiences to make my horrors a bit less scarier.HistoryI have been high myopic from the very childhood. Glasses have been my companion since I was 8. -10D in each eye. Got LASIK done to enjoy glass free vision. Or so i thought. They couldn't correct it completely because my cornea wasn't very thick. I ended up with less thicker glasses, -4.5D in each eye.Things were going pretty well. Vision was 20/25 in both eyes. Life took an unfortunate turn when I had macula-off RD in left eye 4 years ago. The vision in the affected eye is very bad. I can see big objects, cars, people crossing the street and can read big letters on buses. Can't read books or read texts on mobile. Due to this, I am living my life with double vision. My brain has adapted to a great extent. However, while I was recovering from the surgery, I took a lot of steroids to control inflammation. It formed cataract in my good eye. Vision in left eye is 20/200 and it has deteriorated to 20/40 in right because of cataract.In my last appointment with doctor, I discussed the problem I am having lately -- reduced contrast sensitivity, glare and halos at night around street lights and car headlights. I explained how reading blue letters on black background has been difficult lately. I have stopped driving after dusk as it's better safe than sorry. Big blasts of light from car headlights. I am able to do all of the day tasks. My doctor has suggested me to go through Cataract surgery to improve quality of life.Given how complicated my eye history is, he has suggested to get basic lens implanted to avoid complications in long run and wear progressive glasses for near, mid and distant vision post cataract surgery. So far, I am able to use mobile and read labels on shampoo bottle while taking shower without glasses. I spend most of my day (10 - 12 hours) sitting on a computer and use my distant glasses for that. After surgery, my life would be fully dependent on glasses. It scares me to hell that I won't be able to brush my teeth without wearing glasses.Multifocal isn't an option for me. Even if it were, I think I would have not opted for it after reading not-so-good results from it -- halos and glare.How have your experiences with progressive glasses been? Does it take too much time to adapt? I also learned that there is peripheral distortion or swim effect? Is it too bad? How much out-of-focus the vision is if looked through the wrong segment? Can you please post some picture? I am worried if I would be able to do anything at all without glasses. Also, can other person easily make out that it's a progressive lens I am wearing? Will there be any cosmetic change? I am still in early 30s.I have consulted only one doctor so far. Do you recommend getting a second opinion? Not sure if it would change anything.Looking forward to your help!"
Cataract,Some problems after new lens.,Twenty four hours later notice I can see the edges of the implant. Also the pupil is still dilated and reading text is blurred with this eye.

Cataract,IOL Ultraviolet protection concerns,"Hello all,I've recently had a Zeiss AT Torbi 709 implanted. So far I'm quite happy with the visual results. But it has come to my attention that the lens's UV-protection only blocks UV light up to 370nm with a 10% cutoff at about 380nm. The lens transmits 90% at 400nm. An adult natural lens absorbs the full UV-A spectrum up to 400nm. Here is the lens's spectral transmission curve...Now I'm very worried about the 370nm-400nm band of UV light the IOL lets through to the retina. I'm really worried about the long-term health of my retina. I'm in my thirties, so my retina has to last several more decades at least. I asked the doc about this, but he basically said that the IOL's UV protection is sufficient and I need not worry, but sunglasses outdoor would be wise. Your thoughts on this? I'd like to hear especially from those of you who had cataract surgery very long ago.Moderator comment:I have deleted the links to the images as they went to a site unsuitable for inclusion in the forums.

Cataract,Question about vision post surgery,My question is why is the range so tight for the intermediate lens vs the distance lens which is much wider. Couldn't the surgeon have given me a longer range for the intermediate eye when they set up the lens? It would be nice if the LE had more range on the distance side.
Cataract,Tough Cataract decisions after Retinal detachment,"I am a 51 year old, highly myopic patient (left eye -14 and right -12). Both my retinas are generally weak but my left detached , most probably, due to tensile trauma to the left arm.Recently I underwent a macula-on RD vitrectomy in my left eye without lens exchange. My lens is still clear. I am scheduled to remove the silicone oil inserted based on my request due to travel obligations in 3 months time.I have multiple decisions to make:1- should I go for an IOL in left eye even though lens may be clear? Pros include combined surgery and preempting the inevitable cataract. Cons include risk of retinal detachment.2- for anisomotropia evasion, should I go for IOL in right eye shortly thereafter? Pros include anisomotropia evasion, preempting cataract in right eye to which highly myopic individuals are prone to sooner or later and better cosmetic appearance due to the need for light spectacles. Cons include risk of retinal detachment in right eye. Could IOL in left and toric contact lens in right be a permanent, comfortable option noting that I have dry eyes. Could it even be a temporary option until the risky 2-3 year period post-IOL elapse with no RD aftermath in left eye so i can go for an IOL in right eye with higher confidence and an overall mitigated risk profile for both eyes?Awaiting your valuable advice and In advance I thank you for your kind efforts."
Cataract,Received toric PanOptix yesterday,"I've been lurking in the cataracts forum for weeks now -- I'm 47, diagnosed with cataracts in both eyes (probably from taking a statin for at least the last 10 years - it's a risk factor for cataracts). My left eye still sees pretty well, but my right was blurry enough that I couldn't read with it and saw lots of glare during night driving. I spent the last few weeks trying to decide on the right lens. I had the surgery yesterday, so I thought I would pay it forward and describe my experience.I was struggling to decide among a monofocal, the restor 2.5D, and the Symfony, and feeling pretty stressed about it. Then my doctor emails me that the PanOptix trifocal was just approved in the U.S., and it was now the best choice for me. I think the first surgery in the U.S. was 9/4, so I'm definitely one of the first. I have 0.75D astigmatism, which he said wasn't worth fixing with a toric lens; better to do astigmatic keratotomy.So, yesterday was my surgery, at noon. As most people have experienced, the surgery itself was not bad. The worst was probably waiting to be rolled in after being prepped. Though I was definitely sedated, I remember every part of the procedure. The most surprising aspect was my doctor says he's now going to give me a toric lens after all, and not do the AK. But I went to one of the top surgeons in my area so I trusted him.Afterwards, they did not give me an eye shield, saying it wasn't necessary for small-incision surgery. The worst issue yesterday was the dryness and the scratchy feeling, like there was a piece of sand in my eye. I took a couple of doses of tylenol over the day. My vision was hazy and blurry, but I knew not to judge anything that soon. My eye looked completely normal to my girlfriend, maybe the area was just a little swollen. I took a 3 hour nap, and slept plenty that night as well. The doc called in the afternoon to check on me and told me I could use Refresh drops (the single use kind - no preservatives), which definitely helped.This morning my vision was definitely improved, but still hazy and blurry, probably from the remaining dilation. I also saw flashes of light in the lower right corner of my field of vision, mostly when I moved my eye around and there was a bright light nearby. I also saw a dark floater on the very right side of my peripheral vision.I drove to my 9am follow up, where they dilated my eye again (great). Doc said all of the symptoms I was experiencing were normal. The lens position was good, and there was a lot less inflammation than he would have expected -- he even reduced the length of the steroid drops (those sting the most, so, score!). They tested my vision and I could read a good number of lines, but they didn't say what my vision was. I asked about the last minute decision to go toric and he said he did an interoperative measurement and the astigmatism was now between 0.75D and 1D, and since AK was not a permanent fix, he decided it was worth the small overcorrection that might result.As the day went on, my vision improved until my right eye could see distance as well as my left, which was great. The scratchiness is a bit better, now it feels like a hair instead of sand, and not quite as dry. The flashes are still there. With my normal contact lens in my left eye, by 8pm I could read about the same on the computer with each eye; maybe the right eye being just a tad worse. Doc said it will take a little time to adjust to the trifocal, and I should avoid using reading glasses if I could.One thing I noticed comparing the eyes is I could really see the yellow tint from the cataract in my left eye compared to the right. There is still glare from lights in my right eye that just about matches the glare in my left eye from the cataract, but it is definitely better than my right eye had been before surgery. I assume this will improve over the next few days. Doc said it could take a week for all of the above issues to resolve, or improve.So far I am optimistic and encouraged by my status. I will report again tomorrow or the next day."
Cataract,What is scar tissue,After having Scar tissue removed with a capsultomy I am now on the cortisone drops again. I am worried that the drops caused the problem.

Cataract,Watery eye after cataract surgery,"on 14 January this year had cataract surgery in my left eye, everything was fine till 2 weeks after when I developed macular edema. I continued to take 2 types of drops( don't remember the names now) for another 3 months or so. In May the problem was resolved. Around the beginning of July my left eye started to water and therefore blurring a bit my vision. It bother me a lot when I go out as I need to wipe my eyes quite often and need to put on sunglasses as it seems to decrease the watering of the eye.my doctor said it could be blefaritis but don't have sticky eyelids in the morning only some very tiny white discharge, almost invisible.i read that there are 2 kinds of blefaritis. Reading about the causes for blefarities one that could fit mine is through trauma of the eye (cataract surgery) because before surgery never had any problems at all with my eyes. Anyone out there has similar problems?"
Cataract,PCO 9 months after surgery,"hi all, had cataract surgery in Feb 2019 and just got back from optho and she says i have the beginning of PCO. I had no idea. she advises I wait to do YAG until it becomes bothersome. I am in shock as I thought my vision was good. I read 20/20 today. Did this happen quickly to anyone else? how fast is it likely to get worse?"
Cataract,Diamond Eye (AcrySof Monofocal),"Just wanted to mention that my family can see it in certain light. I saw it for the first time today when plucking my eyebrows in a magnifying mirror. It's very freaky and bounces up and down. My son thinks it's cool. I think it's fascinating. But yes, it does look like this (but without the concentric circles):"
Cataract,Cloudiness/waxpaper vision after cataract surgery,"Hi Everyone, I just had surgery Friday, late morning, on my second eye and I noticing some issues that I didn't have after the surgery on my first eye. On my first eye my vision was very clear the day after surgery. I was sensitive to light but everything was in focus. Now, I just completed my second surgery 2 days ago and I'm not seeing the same results.First of all the doctor used a different monofocal lens so I could avoid getting negative dysphotopsia like I did with the first lens. Unfortunately I'm seeing ND in this eye as well. But my main concern is the lake of clarity in this new lens. Everything looks like I'm looking through a wax paper and nothing is clear and the tint is grey. Also, objects look out of focus with this eye. The first eye I had done was set to intermediate and works great. This lens was supposed to be set for distance so I would have mono-vision.My post surgery appointment was done the same day as the surgery so my eyes were still dilated. They tested my eye for vision and pressure and didn't say anything was wrong. The doctor said the waxy vision was normal and would go away in a few days. But if it doesn't clear up, how long should I wait before I bring this to my surgeons attention and what would my options be if there is a problem with lens or the way it was set up prior to surgery?"
Cataract,"Woke up to a flutter in right eye this morning, one year after final exchange ","not sure if anyone had experienced this before. if its just a twitch caused by pressure that will eventually subside, but its really annoying. luckily at home today and do not have to drive, but it interfers with reading, and other focus tasks...any helpful hints, suggestions welcome"
Cataract,Cataract Multifocal Explantataion / Replacement for Monofocal IOL,"I am wondering if anyone here has replaced their EDOF or multifocal for a monofocal and came out satisified with their decision. I would love to hear your opinions. I currently have a panoptix LE and symfony RE. The light disturbances are really irritating to me, and I'm not sure if I'll ever ""neuroadapt"" to it or accept it as my life. I know IOL's aren't perfect, but I'm really struggling. If you have done the replacement / explantation, I would love to know your circumstances."

Cataract,Measurements for the lens before cataract surgery,I have been developing cataracts for a couple of years now and finally my vision has gotten pretty bad.Last week my eye doctor proposed the surgery. I am highly myopic so she wants me to wear glasses for 2 weeks before I come back to take measurements. The problem is that my glasses are not up to date and I don't see well with them driving at night or at work. I wear glasses at home and day driving but put my contacts in for 3-4 hours while I am out at night or at work.Does anyone know how much this will affect my measurements? The doctor said wearing contacts sometimes during this period is ok but didn't specify how much is too much.
Cataract,PanOptix blue light filter concerns,"I'm scheduled for surgery this friday, and had decided on Symfony IOL's until last week when my doctor called to tell me about PanOptix. He doesn't have much information on them, much less has he seen a lot of patients who've received them. As a professional photographer, and noticing enough of a color variation while wearing blue light filtering glasses to warrant not wearing them while editing photos, I'm wondering what PanOptix vision is like in regard to computer screen and in real life. Seems the general consensus is that the IOL's are a great option, but I have yet. to hear anyone really get into the details of visual acuity specific to colors and/or screens.Also, I have a bit of concern about having blue light filtered for the rest of my life. Sure, when in LED artifical form, it's supposed to be bad for us. But for circadian rhythm, it's also supposed to be a key component in natural. light exposure. I haven't found a single iota of information about potential longterm affects of blue light filtering IOL's, or just how much the PanOptix IOL's filter out(it'd be great to have a percentage number).Thanks in advance for any and all information. It's a last-second scramble of a decision to say the least - I'm supposed to call the doc first thing in the morning to order whichever IOL I decide on..."
Cataract,Cataract Surgery Coming up in Two Days - Need Info on Mini-mono,"Posted a moment agoI made the mistake of having my eyes lasered (PRK) when I was in my 60s which is not recommended at that age because of cataracts, but I didn't know and the surgeon never told me. Apparently, because of the PRK, they can't get exact measurements. Luckily, my RE was done with no complications and good intermediary vision on Oct 16. I can now read with no glasses on the computer and read close-up with that eye with glasses at 2.50 power whereas before I needed 3.25. I was also severely myopic and wore contact lenses, but I kept getting calcium deposits on my lenses.Now I'm waiting to get my LE done on Nov 13 and she mentioned mini-mono and asked me if I wanted far or close vision. I crochet and have a shop online but I also need far vision to take the bus. Such a hard decision. Couldn't make up my mind, so she chose far for me. So maybe with just a slight correction for far, I'll be ok but I'm worried. She said I won't lose my intermediary. I read a comment on here saying that they wouldn't mess with mini-mono. With slight correction for far, does this affect only the close vision? How slight can it be? So I would like to hear from anyone else how it went with this same combination?Thank you."
Cataract,Pressure feeling after surgery?,"Hi. I need some advice please. My mum had cataract surgery 5 weeks ago. She was taking eye drops up until more than a week ago. A few days after she stopped she has said that she feels like the eye in which got operated, that it feels like it is pressured feeling? like someone is touching it from the side that kinda pressure? She also said when she wakes up in the morning, her sight is amazing but as the day goes on it isn't the same as first thing in the morning. I said maybe that's cause your brain gets used to looking through both eyes as the day goes on and since her other eye has cataract in it aswell that's probably why? She said she was seeing a shadow on the far corner of her eye that had a bend but after reading this forum I found out that happens to alot pf people.Anyone able to give advice regarding the pressure issue and also with her eyesight not being the same as first thing when waking up. She wears sunglasses to watch tv half the time and for her phone to, cause she says her eye start to feel weird and get blurry after a while?She has a post cataract appointment in 3 weeks at the hospital. But I'm unsure if i should take her to the a&e eye clinic before then?All advice appreciated please."
Cataract,Anybody here have a lens exchange with weak zonules? ,"If you have weak zonules and had an IOL exchange, I would love to hear about it. Why the exchange, where/who did it, results, etc.Thanks!"
Cataract,Symfony lens halos,"This summer I had cataract surgery in both eyes and opted for the Symfony lens implants, including a toric lens in the astigmatic right eye.My experience, two months out in left eye and two months out in right eye: Distance is crisp and colors are sharper. Daytime driving is noticeably easier.Nighttime driving is a problem; severe halos around headlights and streetlights, like starbursts coming at me down the highway and concentric circles particularly in red lights. I also experience the same to some degree with bright images on a dark background on the television screen. Not as intense as with driving, but noticeable halos. My ophthalmologist says they will go away in time, but I am not yet convinced. There has been no improvement yet.Computer work is fine, although I have increased font size a bit for less eye strain. Need 1.25 to 1.50 reading glasses for smaller print in books and on labels. I have residual astigmatism in the right eye, which had a toric lens implant. This may require treatment with Lasik.Considering the expense of the lenses, I may have been better off with mono-focal lenses and continued glasses, which would have been covered by insurance. So the jury is out with me."
Cataract,Corneal Swelling (Edema) after Cataract Surgery (1 week Post Op),"Hi everyone, I finally got my second eye (RE) done a week ago Tuesday. I went into the surgery pretty confident but unfortunately got some cornea swelling . My vision was in a complete white haze, 20/200, pretty much for 4 days. It wasn't until Sunday I noticed big improvement. By Monday fog lifted, I had an appointment that afternoon and eye doc found most of the edema gone, just specs of guttae left. However my vision is still blurry, like 20/30 at best, worse far. I can't seem to find my best focus, as I was targeted to be -0.5 (little myopic). Interim eye doc I saw says to give it a couple weeks, she was not my main doc/surgeon as he is out for a week. I'm no better than pre-op, probably worse because I have negative dysphotopsia like my first eye (LE) .Just wondering if any of you have gone through this? TIA"
Cataract,"In the far IOl eye, can dry eyes effect far vision but not near????? ","I am really confused!!!!.9-10 days post cataract operation far IOL eye vision keeps fluctuating from a range of 1 to 3 meters (10 feet) to 1 to 15+ meters (50+ feet). It goes anywhere from 20/25 vision to 20/70 vision..BUT the first 3 m/10 feet have always stayed sharp throughout the 10 days!.Just now when I was about to post, she put lubricating gel and she was again able to see far and this time 20/20! It keeps going around in circles..QUESTION-1: If it is IOL movement related then how come the first 3m/10 feet always stay sharp?Ok when IOL is near to plano then you could technically read all the way to near/ intermediate, but when it moves nearer you won't see far but continue to see near/ intermediate..QUESTION 2- It does seem dryness related to some extent but why is nearer/intermediate vision not impacted? This I don't have an explanation for!!!!!.The two drops that she is taking against infection/inflammation are.Both the above drops have dry eyes as a possible side effect. Surgeon had said take only the steroid drop due to the dryness/reaction she had to the disinfectant that was used during surgery..On day 4 his clinic opthomologist said we can take Bromfenac (Yellox) as it won't do any harm and because wife could handle the same combination on the previously operated left eye..I am thinking of stopping Bromfenac (Yellox) temporarily as long as we are still on steroid drops (4 more days of steroid drops left). Rational being to help the dry eyes go away (if it is dry eyes related). Restart Yellox in 4 days time when 2 weeks of steroid drops time is up..Any insight?"
Cataract,Monocular vs. binocular vision side effects,"Guys, could you share your perception of side effects with each eye vs two eyes?Let's say RS and LS are monocular right and left eye side effects severity. How would you estimate you binocular side effects? Is it like:?I currently only have pretty noticeable RS (this is the operated eye) and marginal LS. I would estimate my binocular vision like avg(RS, LS). It is enough for night driving even in a slightly rainy weather. Tried it yesterday and today - no problems. I wonder what should I expect with side effects in both eyes?Thanks"
Cataract,Near vision with Symfony EDOF lenses,Yesterday I had an interesting experience. Been shopping around for our move and got a few quotes earlier in the week and finally settled on an item. Brought my printed quote with me to the store and sales rep took it to key in my quote number and couldn't read it. Rep was (I believe) younger than myself but old enough to reach for his readers and still couldn't read it. Albeit it the print was in a light grey font and very tiny. Asked me if I could read it out to him so I took back the sheet and was able to read it.Sometimes we think our near vision isn't good enough and often EDOF lenses aren't touted for best reading vision - better computer distance.But if we can manage our everyday reading needs we should be happy.I mentioned to that rep I had had cataract surgery (he looked at me and said I wasn't old enough to need that). Then said he should look into it as he hated having to put on readers. Told him my opinion of CLE and results not never guaranteed.Anyways this made my day!Have a good weekend everyone.
Cataract,Vision loss from cataract surgery,"A month ago I had cataract surgery in one eye. Prior to surgery I could read some things closeup without glasses, and could read fairly well with glasses. Immediately following surgery I noticed my closeup vision was so blurry I can't read anything with that eye anymore, with or without glasses.I do very fine detailed work so was more than clear when I told the ophthalmologist and surgeon, their staff and the nurses at the surgery center I needed my closeup vision but was not at all concerned about distance vision.According to the ophthalmologist I am farsighted although I've worn glasses for both close up and distance for 55 years. The ophthalmologist told me (the day after surgery) that because I'm farsighted they had to put a farsighted lens (which only corrected my distance vision about 20%) in because it's just too hard for the brain to adjust if they put in a nearsighted lens.That may be true, but should putting in a farsighted lens eradicate the closeup vision I did have? And, shouldn't they have given me a chance to make my own decision about what kind of lens? Even after telling the surgeon I needed closeup vision, he ignored me (or forgot by the time we got into the OR half an hour later) and made the decision for me.At my 2 week followup they told me to just get a pair of cheap readers/magnifying glasses from the drugstore and I would see closeup just fine. They were wrong; everything may be magnified but it's still too blurry to read.This is affecting my work immensely, plus it's making reading no fun anymore. I need to read for my work but I've also been an avid reader since I was 4 yrs old and to lose that, and my job is killing me.Can anyone explain to me what has happened, if it can be corrected and how it?"

Cataract,Due for Cataract Surgery with a Stye,"Hi,I just had cataract surgery done on my right eye with exfoliation glaucoma and everything went great. Now I'm due in two weeks to get the left one done and I suddenly came down with a stye. In the meantime, I had to see my retina specialist for another problem in my left eye and noticed the bump and told me it was a stye. I had told him some time after putting my last eye drops of Simbrinza in my left it started to burn and tearing like crazy. He gave me a small tube of an antibiotics and told me to put this over my eyelid and on my eye. I'm having so much trouble putting this on, I'm sure I'm not doing it correctly.I emailed the doctor's admin assistant who will do the surgery and she said not to worry that we still have two weeks to go. But it doesn't seem to be going away and I'm worried. I don't see any white at all, just a small bump but higher than the edge where the eyelashes are. I did pass my finger over and it seems to be sore at the edge but all I see is that small bump. The whole eyelid is red.Has anyone experienced anything like this? How did you manage to put the ointment from the tube onto your eye? I tried to pull my eyelid up but the line of ointment that comes out just won't go onto the eye. I'm scared to go ahead with the surgery with this. The doctors do not seem to be concerned at all. My retina doctor told me no need to have my cataract doctor see it before surgery."

Cataract,RE post operation thread + updates + auto refractometer ,"So last time after the LE (near IOL eye) was done my wife ended up with corneal erosion in the line of sight = very blurry vision..On the post OP day the normal steroid drops were stopped for 2-3 days and repair lubricating gels were given. After 3 days Dexa free steroid drops were then started. Wife had fully blurry vision for 6 days and then the cornea healed and she finally had super sharp near vision in the LE!.Now for the RE, the surgeon used the strategy of using loads of vitamin A gel after he closed the wound and disinfected it properly. No steroid drops for the 1st day. Today was post OP check and he found 2-3 small dry dots on the cornea even though the eye was swimming in lubricant Vitamin A gel. No full erosion/patches on the cornea like last time but still enough to cause some blurriness..Now he is 99.99% sure as to what was happening as my wife never had dry eye issues coming into both operations..My wife's cornea seems to react to Betadine (the iodine containing disinfectant used for eye surgeries etc, there are no alternatives to it and it HAS to be used during surgery)..The last time when LE was operated, Betadine must have caused some damage to the cornea. Then when the strong steroid drops were used on top, the damage was made lot worse and resulted in my wife suffering severe burning pain and longer blurry vision. So if wife had taken steroid drops like last time, the RE would again have had more pronounced corneal erosion like the LE..Doc has told us to take Vitamin A gel on it's own for one more day (nothing else) and then start with Dexa free Steroid drops from tomorrow. He wants the cornea to heal bit more. We have to go back on Tuesday for follow up check with one of his assistant like last time, just to be safe (he is away operating). He is sure that she will see super sharp like the left eye.Yesterday wife was seeing blurry post OP (normal). This morning she started seeing 90% sharp. It is improving all the time. The 2-3 dry spots on the cornea + only one day since OP + very thick layer of Vitamin A gel= 10% blurriness in the RE (last time at same post 1 day, LE was 90% blurry).We had 1 hour walk on the way back from the surgeon today, aim was to provide more visual data to the brain so that it could kick start the software upgrade process.Wife started crying during the walk because she was able to see everything so much brighter, clearer and colourful. With RE only she can see my eyes from 40cm away. Car number plates she could read very well 30m away. Company signs 40-70meter away. She could recognize people from far away which she has not been able to do for last 4 months.Hope all goes well and she gets to 100% sharpness.LE was targeted for -1.25 and RE for -0.25.RE readings 1 day post OP are meaningless but auto refractometer says...1 day later= +0.25Now the confusing part! LE was operated 4 weeks ago.3 day later = -2.757 days later = -1.504 weeks later = -2.00 wtf ???????We checked the measurement printouts when we left the clinic, on seeing -2.00 we went back and luckily the surgeon was outside to collect the next patient, so we quickly grabbed him and asked him about it. He said don't worry as auto refractometer are not accurate specially post OP.**Note- ** The sharpest focus point for LE has not changed since day 7. We have measured it 2-3 times daily. It has stayed exactly same since day 7 at average distance of 45-47cm. If anything it has moved away couple of cms and not closer. On day 3 it was around 30cm.Both eyes are working together well already for my wife. So I am not sure if there is really a difference of 2.25 diopters between both eyes!How will we get absolute accurate measurements in the future? Via Keratometer?We are cautiously optimistic and happy. Wife sees super sharp near and far vision is improving 10 times faster than LE was. Combined vision is very good too!"
Cataract,"Myopia, astigmatism, subcapsular cataract. Any way to maintain near vision after surgery?","helloim glad i found you. ive been researching on my own after first surgical consult left me with questions ( and the promised "" will return all calls"", never materialized )Has anyone who started with terrific near vision been able to maintain that after IOL IMPLANT? i was told it wasnt possible because i need a toric lens unless I opt for monovision and use one eye to read and the other for distance which sounds dizzying.ive worn glasses for distance most of my life and taken them off to read. Ive never had an issue wearing glasses for distance. The thought of reversing this scares me. Im used to reading a lot and to suddenly need help seeing phone or books or computer is scary . Was this an issue for anyone else?Thank you"

Cataract,Great wall of China text/questions/thoughts...RE OP,"Approaching business end of the 4 months cataract drama, second operation in 3 days and I have too much nervous energy to expend.....Taking the above Zeiss image as reference...My wife's LE,.Astigmatism: Pre OP -0.64 or -0.58. Post OP -0.75 (Autorefractor )LE Axial length is 22.45mm.IOL was set for near, and based on autorefractor reading, the IOL it has settled at -1.50 (instead of target of -1.25)-1.25 would have apparently given sharp vision at around 80cmHer sharpest focus point currently is at 42cm to 52cm roughly...but decent usable focus up to 72cm..My question 1-.Can -1.50 really give such sharp vision at around 45cm range?????? Wouldn't you normally need something like -2.0 or -2.5 to get sharp near vision? Am I missing something? Does the auto refractor measure at IOL plane or eye glasses plane?Right Eye far target -0.25 operation coming up next and currently -Astigmatism: -0.24 or -0.34 or -0.29 or -0.75 (Autorefractor ). Variation I think is based on the machine that was used at different clinics. Maybe Keratometer vs Autorefractor too?LE Axial length is 22.35mm.My question 2-.As the RE's axial length is practically same as LE and as same formulas have been used. Would it mean the RE will undershoot slightly too like left eye did or it can still go either way? I guess it can move either way because of where it settles in the capsule???RE far eye will be targeted for -0.25 but realistically it can land at any of these numbers-.Such a mind twister this cataract! Stay tuned FINGERS CROSSED NERVOUSLY!!!"
Cataract,Vision can take months to settle after cataract surgery,"I am posting this in case it helps others. It's been 4 months since my LE cataract surgery. At one month I was measured at plano. At two months, I was measured at +.25. At 3 months I was still +.25. At 4 months, I am now at +.5 -.25. Note that my current measurement was done twice just a few days apart so I think it's quite accurate."
Cataract,Tecnis ZKB00 multifocal combined with a monofocal?,"Hi there,Dearest thanks to all who offer advice on this forum, helping others (like me) sort out this confusing world of intraocular lens choices. Sorry for the LOOOONG description below, but I figure it's all relevant.I am 50, have had cataracts R>L for 5 years. Prior to that, R eye has been -2.5 since age 20, and L eye (dominant) was -1. Always wore contacts. Minimal to no astigmatism. When I became a little presbyotic around age 40, I opted for monovision with contacts, went against the advise of the optometrist who wanted to correct my L eye and leave my R eye nearsighted because the difference was so jarring I couldn't drive. So instead I corrected my R eye for distance and within a year my L eye went back to 20/20 naturally. Sometimes our bodies react to being over-splinted, but that's another topic.I'm a very active, outdoor person but also use computers and do crafty tasks. I expect near and far vision. I expect a lot out of life. I'm kind of a boot-straps person: like to be tough, but am learning just how very sensitive I in fact am (joys of middle age). I don't want glasses, but could survive with contacts if I had to. The worst thing about reading glasses for me would be the need to always have them, say, even for grocery shopping reading labels, or looking at my phone. If I had to keep a pair with my laptop, well, I guess that wouldn't be so bad. But cooking...that's intermediate too, right? I'm aiming for another 50 years, so this is a long term decision!7 weeks ago I had Tecnis ZKB00 multifocal +2.75D put into non-dominant R eye (the worse cataract). Love my surgeon (the third one I saw over the years, and the first one to spend time really talking to me). I didn't do any research about lenses: life often brings me what I need if I stay in the flow, and so I went with his conviction that this was the right lens for me. Said he put this lens in his mother, and in a two-year old. Also, I was of course nervous and felt that exposing myself to the overload of the internet wouldn't really help. My mother is a happy monovision patient for the past 20 years. My aunt who reads all the time opted for both eyes distance (oddly) and uses reading glasses. Neither of them are very active outdoor people although they are also high-performing individuals.The surgery went well and he is overjoyed with the numbers. It was a quite advanced cataract and he did a great job adjusting the ultrasound so as to not damage the posterior capsule. And, I spent the first five weeks in a state of shock and panicky anxiety. He'd mentioned I might have temporary glare at night with the first glance at headlights, that would fade as the pupil constricted in the moment. Said 5% of people are bothered by that. But I had no idea I'd get these huge halos and ghost images around lights, day and night. Computer text, even a written page, has large ghosts. So did white lines on the street. So do any fluorescent or halogen or LED lights. Halos are several bright concentric rings that, say, with a bicycle light will obscure the cyclist they are so large in diameter. Once the oncoming headlights obscured a parked car in my lane at night (didn't hit it). Those lit up No Left Turn arrows? Forget it: almost the whole lane is whited out. Computer work is also affected, because I occasional graphic design and the ghosting interferes with that.My visual acuity with that eye is superb far and pretty great near and intermediate. The distance vision is startlingly beautiful. The world is much more three-dimensional. When I go hiking during the daytime I can get so euphoric because everything is so clear into the distance. Night vision is also fine when I look where there are no lights. Beautiful, in fact.So a couple weeks ago I got a grip on my upset and anxiety, because of course anxiety will not help the neuroadaptation happen any faster. I'm looking hard at the emotional reasons for eyesight loss (another huge topic) and dealing with that stuff. And three days ago I started doing some exercises with Gabor patches with an app called Extreme Eye Exercises (paid programs for these are $400 and since they can't measure glare and haloing, clinical results aren't available with those, so I'm opting for the free app and hoping that it's comparable). I tried Alphagan drops and they didn't really help and caused very uncomfortable eye and head pain.So grateful for the many posts by @Sue.An2 and others...I understand that these might improve over months to years, but not really go away. Just become something one accepts.Having the moon and stars affected makes me profoundly sad.I don't know that I can accept this. Which also makes me sad.It felt right when we made the decision.I volunteer for a living overseas, and so can't get a second opinion in the U.S. Timing becomes a factor because I travel home in order to get these done. We weren't going to do the second eye until January, so this totally changes everything. And now I'm doing all that online research...boo.So: after talking to me for an hour one Sunday, his algorithm would be the following, although he definitely did not want to exchange the lens that was so perfectly placed (understandable):He wants the lens exchange done within 3 months, which would be early August. Said it starts to get messy in there after that. I do trust his skill. And when someone says they're not comfortable, one should pay attention, right?My thoughts/questions:I'd like to wait longer to see how this adapts or if I can work some emotional/energetic magic, but...maybe by 7 weeks we already know? Is waiting longer just wasting time?I know some surgeons will do an exchange even years out, but a friend of mine told me that might be like getting an abortion at 8 1/2 months: sure, you can do it but it's not recommended if at all avoidable. Should I wait in order to slow the process down and see about adaptation? Or is that just creating risk?If we do monofocal in the L eye for distance, he might want to do it slightly undercorrected to help support near vision. But if we then do a lens exchange on the right, I'd go for a monovision set up, and so then would want the left to be 20/20 for distance. So that confounds things...argh.If I stay with just the multifocal covering my near vision, it won't be as good as it could be with a nearsighted monofocal lens on the R eye...It doesn't seem like there are any glasses or contacts that can fix a multifocal lens problem. That's one benefit of the monovision approach: one can always correct the near eye to see bivisual distance, or correct the far eye to see bivisual near. That seems like an advantage to me. My mother hardly ever uses glasses: only when dim reading. (Although now, after 20 years, her distance vision faltered and she's using a contact lens again in that eye.). Also, my surgeon did mention that there are multifocal corneal things in the pipeline. So those who get monofocals might eventually be able to get multifocal vision anyway.I didn't even think there was a choice to be made about WHICH monofocal to use. Reading here, you all seem to have opinions about different brands, acrylic vs. silicone, which focal point to choose, etc. Isn't the branding and such best left to the surgeon?Okay that's about enough over-explanation to a bunch of strangers...thank you all for whatever input you might have. And thank you again for sharing your experiences because just hearing what others are living makes it easier."
Cataract,"Very little driving but watch lots of TV, use a 15 inch computer screen and read quite alot.","The TV is about 8 feet away and the 15"" computer screen is about 18 inches from my face. I drive mostly during the day, but not often, and would like to be able to drive at night, when necessary, if I could see the road. I like to read, too, currently large print books only. I am not opposed to wearing glasses when needed. I had a cataract consult yesterday and left confused. I have advanced cataracts and, for this reason, the Dr. says laser option is the best, which is fine, despite the added cost of $1299 per eye. However, he pushed really hard for a ""Forever Young"" option ($4,290 extra, per eye) which will give good distance AND mid-range, and lessen the need for reading glasses. Next best choice, per Dr., would be ""Precision Vision"" option ($2,935 extra, per eye) for ""precise"" distance OR near vision, my choice, and wear glasses some of the time. I will meet with them again in a couple of days with my choice and to be measured. Once I got home and looked at the pamphlet with the choices, I realized how confused I am, mostly about what the difference is between the $1299 option and the Precision Vision option. I'm 68 and on medicare and while I can come up with the money for the more expensive options if I had to, is it really worth it for me? Thoughts???"
Cataract,Preservative-free multi-use lubricant eye drops available in U.S.,"I know many of us use artificial tears post cataract surgery. I've been using the preservative-free vials and just saw that Allergen Refresh Relieva PF, multi-use preservative-free eye drops, are now available in the U.S. Not sure about other countries. I was shopping this morning and didn't see them in my local stores yet, but I just ordered some off Amazon to try. Passing along the info in case anyone else is interested."
Cataract,Vision declined in one eye 14 months after cataract surgery,"About a year ago I had monovision cataract surgery with two Tecnic toric lenses. The distance diopters targeted for the IOLs were: Left (dominant eye) -0.5, and Right, -1.50. CYL for Left was 2.25, and for Right was 1.50.The results were great. My left eye’s distance vision was close to 20/20. My right eye came in at about -2.25 diopters. While that was more nearsighted than planned, that works great for me as my near vision is great, and I’ve had no problems adapting to that much monovision. I understand that coming in more myopic on the right was not unusual, since the right eye before cataracts was already quite myopic (approximately -7 diopters), and that would increase the error rate.Just today, I noticed the vision declined in the left eye. Distance vision has dropped to about 20/90 (I have an eye chart at home). When I put a cloth pirate patch on the left to check the vision on the right (which was unchanged), the left eye kind of hurt, like a sinus infection might make it hurt. The vision seems kind of cloudy, and colors are less vibrant than for the near eye.I have an appointment this afternoon with urgent care ophthalmology at the same hospital that did the surgery.What do you think might be causing this blurred vision? What questions should I be asking? What should the doctor be checking for?Thank you."
Cataract,"Starbursts, Halos, Glares, etc before surgery.. Better now with new IOL?","So everyone talks about the halos, glares, flares, starbursts that EDoFs and Multifocals can cause. However did most of you not have these issues before lens exchange? I have those issues now with my cortical cataracts and astigmatism. Starbursts are what bothers me the most, it is ""moderate"" but I can still drive. I am hoping no matter what IOL I choose, it will get better. If it gets better than I will be happy, but any chance it could get worse?Could anyone share their before and after surgery experience?Thank you"
Cataract,near vision poor after getting Symfony...seeking others' experience,"Hi,I'm 44 years old and just had the first of two eyes implanted with the new (I'm in the U.S.) Symfony Toric lens, which I've researched extensively and was very eager and excited to get.Now four days since having the surgery, I'm mostly satisfied: colors are much brighter and more vibrant (and more pinkish, bluish, interestingly), my distance vision is now restored and fine, and I can see pretty well at intermediate distances, i.e. objects are clearly defined all the way in to about 23 inches away, perhaps even 21 inches away in bright light (yes, I notice some degradation in low light, more than I'd expected).The real issue for me is my near vision, which is much worse than I was expecting. I do know that the Symfony isn't all-around perfect, that e.g. I might expect only 20/32 or so (mean uncorrected near achieved in the U.S. clinical trials). And I know that's just an average, but even the distributions left me hopeful, with 81% of trials patients achieving 20/40 or better (that's monofocally; 96% were better than 20/40 bifocally). Meanwhile, I'm struggling to make out these words as I type, pretty much anything inside of 23 inches is blurry, and in good light I can only make out the 20/80 line (if I really exert myself, I can barely make out, mostly by guessing, some of the 20/60 letters, but mostly they're entirely unrecognizable). I feel as if I could have gotten results like this simply by going with monofocals, and I'm beginning to fear this is as good as it'll get, which is depressing.Some background facts: Pre-op, I was mildly myopic (-1.75) in this eye and mildly astigmatic (about 0.94 cylinder). Also, at 44 I'd already gotten used to presbyopia, and typically would wear +1.25 readers for near. The specific lens implanted was the ZXT150 +16.5 (1.5 D cylinder). I doubt lens alignment is off, as my distance and intermediate vision feels non-astigmatic. My other eye (right) is scheduled for another Symfony lens 10 days from now.So, I wonder:1) Have others had similar experiences, i.e. poorer than expected near vision?2) Does anyone have any idea what might have caused this?3) Can anything be done to correct it?4) If anything can be done, should I expect my ophthalmologist to do it (without having to pay more than the significant amount I've already paid)?Thanks for any info and advice!"
Cataract,Grainy feeling after OP?,"Wife feels like a grain in the eye. I assume she is feeling the cut from surgery? She did not feel it before.Could it be because she started work 2 days ago so constantly looking at the screen is causing more eye dryness, hence she started feeling since yesterday?Google says eye or eye nerve that get cut during cataract surgery take 2-6 weeks to heal and regenerate. Tomorrow will be 2 full weeks since surgery.Visually eye looks same as non operated eyeThanks."
Cataract,What was targeted by surgeon and where did you end up?,I thought we can have everyones outcome in one place. Operated eyes only. So follow this pattern if you want to play...LE Target was -1.25LE Outcome was -1.50Comment- Happy accident. We were too chicken to target -1.65. Although if we had really gone for -1.65 and it had ended up at around -2.0 then that would not have been good either!
Cataract,Post surgery visual distubance... normal or not?,"Had cataract surgery two weeks ago, eye seems to be healing but having odd side effects.1. Now have a 45 degree slice of halo around bright lights when in the dark. I can see my eye opening and closing over it. Also an almost horizontal bar of light jetting off from the top of that.2. Ghosting in operated eye which appears to be a reflection of any light source, window, light, mirror, screen. the image appears to be projected slightly in front of and to the left and down of the actual object. The accumulation of these images in a brightly lit supermarker make depth perception and orientation difficult. Makes me feel light headed.3. double images, probably related to the ghosting, but separate images whereas the ghosting is an extension of the image.4. Lots of brown floaters, very annoying, hopefully that one is normal. not sure about others though.Any one else had these symptoms and if so what was causing it? Have had monofocal lens put in on the NHS so no discussion about lens choices!"
Cataract,YAG Laser on only one good eye,"Hi Team,Hope you all doing well. Most of you might have seen my posts last year regarding having only one good eye and which I had to go through cataract on it in Dec 2018. I went with -1.5 distance for it and I was really happy with the outcome. How ever vision got blurray in last 2 months and visited doctors and they suggested to go through YAG for removing it. I m planning to do it as its kind of disturbing now.. can you please advise if any risks going through YAG? As per my research and discussions with doctors this looks like a simple procedure and need not to be worry.. But just wanted to get your thoughts as I have only vision in that eye ?.. Please advise I m worried abut folaters also"
Cataract,Can someone help me better understand astigmatism please?,"I understand that the cornea is shaped differently with astigmatism and that it makes your vision blurry. Does it affect distance vision more than near vision? Is it different with a monofocal IOL? Seems I have read having some astigmatism may help you see near better. Not sure if that is always the case or just with an IOL. I have 2 monofocal IOLs and am halfway through the lens exchange process to different monofocal IOLs. In my right eye at my one week lens exchange postop, I was -.25S and -.25 or-.5C (phoropter vs autorefractor) at 130 degrees. I am now 2.5 weeks post op. It's hard to tell for sure, but it seems my best vision is in the mid to far intermediate range. I haven't measured exactly but about 3 ft to 6 ft maybe. I realize my vision could still be changing, but I am also wondering if the astigmatism is playing into it. My distance vision is manageable but definitely blurry. Part of what I am trying to figure out is what to target for my left eye IOL exchange. I want distance. LE is currently .25 no astigmatism. I'd prefer 0 to -.25 but am wondering if I would see blurry with -.25 since my RE is blurry. Thanks in advance ?"
Cataract,Left eye: Post 6 day OP update and more...,"Wife's LEFT eye operation 6 days ago. Operation went perfect. Wife came out of OP all happy and ate the food they provided. Eye looked visually same as before the OP.We came home by tram. Was VERY windy that day but she was wearing protective glasses. Her left eye vision was completely blurry, I think the brain got confused and right eye (also has cataract) became blurry too! A simple journey home became like I was leading a fully bind person home.Later that night, eye had very bad allergic reaction to steroid drops and steroid cream, think the preservative or something in it. Her eye lids swelled up big and red. White part of eye was red too! Her eyes were burning as if someone had poured acid into it. Tears were continuously pouring from her eyes. We assumed it was part of the healing process. Inside I was worried, what if it was an infection!!!!Next day we saw surgeon and he initially assumed that it was reaction to Iodine but once he checked the eye he saw that there was corneal surface erosion. He halted the steroid drops and gave repair creams/gels. Two days later we restarted a different DEX free steroid drop.Left eye vision stayed blurry for 5 full days!!!!!!!! Once in a while she could see 90% sharp in the operated eye for few seconds and then back to blurry. Left eye would also act like a camera lens trying to find focus. Combined vision was not sharp either. Wife was calm through out but by 5th day she was starting to think that maybe her luck was running out. I was dying inside but trying to stay calm and be positive.Things finally seem to be changing!!!!! Looks like her cornea erosion has fully healed or almost healed. This must have been the main reason for her blurriness. Confirmation tomorrow when we see surgeon again. Visually no swelling or redness anymore, I can't tell anymore which eye was operated.Her left eye is consistently STAYING sharp today (not just for few seconds). No zooming in and out camera effect anymore either.Until yesterday she was saying that no way is she going to operate on her ""good"" right cataract eye!Today she is fully up for operating on right eye as she is seeing that the left eye shows so much better details, colours and sharpness! She clearly sees how bad her right cataract eye is now. Until yesterday she was thinking right eye was such a good eye ?Combined vision is getting better, both eyes are starting to work bit better together but right eye obviously has cataract which is dense by now.Some interesting things.Left eye IOL was supposed to be set for around 80cm at the sharpest: -1.25 (glad we did not go for -1.65)Right eye was going to be set in the next OP for -0.25BUT on operated left eye, wife is getting the sharpest 100% sharp vision consistently at around 42cm...sometimes also 60cm range. She is able to do her ladies makeup stuff, see her food etc properly. Outside she was able to see stitching on her shoes very clearly too when standing (1m+ distance). In the tram she could see number plates of cars from the window 2m away.Now question is, if her consistently sharpest point is 42cm, then that means it is potentially 38cm off the target! Will it stay there or move away in coming days/weeks?It is kind of nice where it is actually so we are not fully sure what we wish anymore nor what to do with the right eye!!!!I am just happy that she is seeing sharp after 5 days of COMPLETE blurriness ?This really drained me!!!! Keeping track of all the drops while wondering what the hell was going on with her eye was such a mind#**k!Tomorrow we see surgeon again. He has been really good! We still feel we picked the right surgeon. I don't think the other ones would have stayed in touch with us thorugh out this ordeal.So stay tuned!"
Cataract,discomfort corner of eye after cataract/laser,my wife had cataract surgery and then laser surgery to correct scarring on one eye. since the laser surgery she has a very annoying feeling in her eye that half a contact lens is stuck in the corner. she has been checked by two ophthalmologists and both state that they can see nothing wrong. Has anyone else had this and were they able to get help for it?

Cataract,Trying to understand diopter difference between 2 eyes...,"I am trying to understand something.As things stand, 7 days post OP my wife's LEFT eye is currently @ -1.5 (Premium Monofocal IOL)Her NON operated right eye which used to be +0.5, just three months ago is currently showing +1.75!!! (Btw 5 days ago right eye was showing +1.5!)Question 1- Is that big change from 0.5 to 1.75 in the right eye due to the cataract getting dense? It was a fast spreading cataract.Question 2- Wife sees blurry far. I assume that is combination of right eye having dense cataract + left natural lens being removed and replaced by IOL set for near.My question, is the big difference between left eye (-1.5) and right eye (+1.75) = 3.25 diopter truly REAL?What I mean, is it""similar"" to when people have full monofocal vision? OR does it not count as she still has accommodation in the right eye?She feels slight nausea when looking far in crowded areas like railway station and airport. Could also be purely blur related rather than diopter difference related.Could someone throw some light?"

Cataract,Just my latest thoughts on my cataract surgery,"Hi guys,I had both eyes operated on for posterior polar cataracts which were supposed to be very complex surgery and it's been around six months since the last eye was done and here is what's going on. First off, the surgery on both eyes seemed to go very well. It turned out to be easier than they thought, thank God. I have an appointment with my local eye doctor this week and these are my issues.I still have no confidence in my driving even though my vision has been improved from surgery. I am still seeing things that are not there. When I go for a doctors visit the bright lights and white rooms really screw up my vision. The last time I saw my local eye doctor he said besides the posterior polar cataracts I also had an issue with my corneas which he said were no problem although this was the same doctor who originally thought my cataracts were not a problem. I dread going to eye doctor appointments as every time I go another problem arises.Just wanted to vent a little. Thanks for listening..."

Cataract,Post OP thread,"So we just got home after operation around 3hrs ago. Last operation of the day. Wife was very calm before and during the surgery. I was dying waiting for her though ?Wife cracked lot of jokes with the surgeon and his team.Surgeon was very good and extremely nice along with his team. We even have his mobile number if we need it for any reason.He gives it to all his surgery patients!!!We definitely picked the right surgeon, Dr Zeiss!We are seeing him tomorrow for 1 day check.Some questions -Just after op wife saw relatively blurry but 3hrs since operation her vision has become more blurry. I assume that is normal?She is lying down in bed and says she struggles to open her eyes. It opens around 50%.- 60%. Normal too?No eye patch required/given.Nurse said to wear glasses outside for protection against dust, insects etc. Wife is worried that she might rub her eyes in her sleep.

Cataract,Peopel can be really ******* (add expletive),"I know technically cataract operation is no big deal but the consequences and choices definitely impact quality of your future life. Wife is at work and some stupid woman who works in the same building started grilling my wife about what all the fuss is about!My wife has not had any discussion with this stupid woman about her eyes nor gone to her for advice.Yet she was acting like she is the surgeon and was trying to impose her views on my wife. Her friend had cataract operation done few years ago so she thinks she is an expert and everyone should do what her friend did!!!!!!This friend of her had thick glasses all her life, so completely different situation. She was telling my wife I don't know why you just don't do both eyes for far and just wear glasses always like she herself does. My wife said surgeon is trying his best to make me as less dependant on glasses as possible and most likely I will need glasses anyway.Wife said doing fitness with glasses is not easy for an instructor. This person was becoming angry and worked up towards my wife. Stupid lady and her friend have never worked out and the only workout they do is going to McDonald's! As if my wife does not have enough on her plate!Funny thing is that this same lady makes such a fuss when it is anything about her own health or her family's health.For me, more stressful than cataract has been the way people act!!!!!Anyway, CHILL deep breath!!!!!!"
Cataract,Yo yo land. Final thread about choosing surgeon (promise) ,"My wife did not want me to post this thread as we have taken too much of your bandwidth.Anyway last 2 days my wife has been saying that she is worried that Dr Zeiss's 1.4 diopter difference between the two eyes might be too much and if 0.5 diopter error happens, she might end up needing glasses for near and far, a situation she does not want.With that in the air, Rockstar ends up emailing us today and wife is kind of leaning towards Dr Rockstar's safer options!So two excellent surgeons, both with 10,000 operations etc. Both recommended Mini-Monovision over multifocals, but both recommend different directions.Current status-Left eye cataract: Very dense.Right eye cataract: Semi dense but changing.Dominant eye- No one knows truly. Currently Right eye is dominant but that could be because left eye has bad visibility. Patient is right handed and writes and throws with right hand.SURGEON-Dr RockstarWill operate left eye first (dense cataract eye) and set it for plano or -0.20 if we prefer.Right eye 1 month later or more and set it for -1.0 or -1.20So a difference of 1 diopterIOL: He prefers in order- Hoya Vivinex > Alcon Clareon > Zeiss CT Lucia > Kowa. He said that they are all premium lenses and have the same features (aspherical, blue light block, UV A and UV B filter, hydrophobic).SURGEON- Dr ZeissWill operate both eyes together or if we prefer, left eye only first. He will set left for -1.60Right eye for -0.2 a month laterDifference of 1.40 diopter, with Right eye set for far unlike Left eye for far with Dr Rockstar.IOL: Zeiss Asphina (pco loving)Worst outcome for wife: Needing glasses for near and far!!!!Ideal outcome for wife: Needing glasses for near only!Thanks for listening if you made it here ?"
Cataract,Secondary Cataract in eye 6 months after surgery,"Hi Everyone,I had one eye done six months ago. I got an Alcon IOL mono acrylic lenses placed in my eye. This lens I believe has sharp edges and are designed to prevent PCO. A month ago I started noticing some refraction and glare from lights when none existed before. I had my six month check up and the doctor said I have a very slight cataract forming in the operated on eye. I understand I can use a YAG laser for PCO. Does anyone know what the risks are for this procedure and whether or not it also treats Negative Dysphotopsia?"

Cataract,Shadow Effect At Sides Of Eyes,I've recently had cataract surgery in both eyes. There is a shadow effect at the sides of both eyes almost like having blinders on. It gets a little claustrophobic feeling. It is not in all lighting only some lighting or angles of light. It is kind of annoying. Will it go away in time?
Cataract,"PanOptix and glistenings or ""diamond eye""?","I've seen some very good discussions on the overall quality of vision and any impacts to contrast sensitivity with PanOptix (thanks especially to janus381 for her detailed descriptions of her experiences).What I haven't seen is any mention here of incidences of glistenings with this lens. I've read elsewhere that the Acrysof platform in general, and in one source the PanOptix specifically, had a moderately-higher incidence of glistenings than other ""glistening free"" lenses like Tecnis platform and (I think) the FineVision.Does anyone have any personal experience with these (either way), preferably with the PanOptix specifically? I'm also curious if a specific lens having glistenings is something that can be detected and caught prior to implantation, or if this determination is made strictly after implantation?Same question about ""diamond eye"" - although I'm not completely sure what this is, and have only seen one surgeon making a related blanket statement about all Alcon lenses."
Cataract,Progressive Lenses after Cataract surgery,"I had Cataract surgery done 2 months ago for both eyes. Before the surgery, I was using progressive Varilux lenses which are pretty expensive $300+ with my insurance contributing almost $200. I don't need glasses to see far and my reading numbers are gone by half. I can always use over the counter glasses for reading. But, I use glasses for watching TV while working on Laptop. What are the different types of progressive lenses?. Have anyone switched from Varilux to other progressive lenses? Do I need Varilux after my numbers have gone down so much (far: do not need glasses, near has gone down by 50%).?Thanks in advance."
Cataract,Scar tissue covering Lens,I cannot see through my new lens but can see the dirty lens from the inside. Is this unusual?
Cataract,Cataract Surgery with Restore Multifocal 2.5? Anyone?,"Hi All! I'm scheduled for Cataract Surgery next Wednesday on my left eye, right the following wednesday. I'm getting extremely anxious as this gets closer and have a call into my surgeon in hopes to answer a few last questions before surgery.Background:I'm a 46 year old female who was told I was developing cataracts 6 or so years ago. Posterior subcapsular cataracts. I have had pretty poor vision since my teens and wear contacts of -7.5 in each eye. I do need readers but have been in denial and just deal with it. The past few years my vision is worse - very cloudy in the left, less in the right, but it has been affecting my night driving and I can only see a persons shape when a light source is behind them. Also note I have light blue eyes that are extremely sensitive to light - I wear sunglasses on any kind of bright day - even the cloudy bright days. My regular eye dr does perform cataract surgery. However, when I started looking around I wanted the best and most experienced surgeon. On the recommendation of a co-worker whose wife worked at an opthamologist, I looked into their doctors and ultimately picked a dr. based on reviews and posted experience. Of course he is at the one location 45 minutes away but to me it is worth it. He performs the surgery with the femtosecond laser as an option and is recommended if you choose a multifocal lens.I met with him for the first time last November (2018) and he did all the measurments for the lens/surgery. We discussed the pros/cons of the multifocal. I love the idea of being free of glasses for most things (distance, driving, computer) but don't mind so much if I wear readers to read fine print or menus. Via a follow up call to answer some of my questions, he said he uses Restore multifocals and would use a ""active focal distant dominant"" lens in my first eye and then see how he'd need to adjust the second based on my vision.So after rescheduling this surgery twice, i thought i was ready to go. Until I started researching the lenses. Then I got confused and scared.My concerns are this:Picking the wrong lens - I've read there are more side effects with the multi than mono but I'd really prefer the multi.I don't know the surgeon well and don't have that relationship and I guess comfort level i would like only seeing him once. Though when i asked if this was normal, his scheduler said it was and people have flown in for surgeries never meeting him until that day.I've also read and seen a few horror stories about pupils being mis-shaped after surgery. Or glow in the dark pupils. Please tell me i won't look weird to people after surgery (I know it is vain). I'm wondering if this is lens related or just a possibility with any cataract surgery?I also read somewhere the restore multis have a higher rate of glistenings?I'm also worried about light sensitivity after the cataracts are removed.A final note - I decided not go with my regular eye doctor because she doesn't have the experience or number of surgeries as the surgeon 45 minutes away. She also does not use the femtosecond laser and said it hasn't proved to have any better outcomes. She uses Tecnis multifocals. She told me I can transfer all of the measurements to her or anyone and suggested I wait until my dry eye under control. My eyes aren't overly dry, but they become irritated from contacts and I think it's more the contacts than dryness, but not sure.So that has me a bit confused. Did any of you use a surgeon other than your regular eye dr? Is it normal to only meet a surgeon once and go for it?Sorry for the long post. Thank you all for your time and any input!"
Cataract,Mini- Monovision diopter questions! Please answer any question that you can. ,"Before I contact Doc again I wanted to clarify my understanding. In the context of Mini Monovision...Q1- For the eye set to far, am I correct in understanding that in general it is better to be under corrected than over corrected. So for example -.2 is better than +.2?Q2- If Plano in the far eye means perfect sharp vision to infinity. Like mountains and moon? What will -.2 or -.5 mean?Your sharp point moves from infinity to bit closer? How much closer? Moon and mountains will appear slightly blurry, completely blurry? I can't wrap my head around this fully. I have +1 reading glasses that I rarely use, so if I look far wearing them then something like that is what my wife will see if it overshoots to +.5 (ok half that blurriness as my reader are +1 and not +.5)?Q3- Dr Zeiss's recommendation of -.2 with -1.4 for example is superior to Dr Rockstars Plano and -1 recommendation, as it wins you more near and intermediated vision sacrificing really far vision. Correct?Specially if Dr. Rockstar plano ends up overshooting in the + direction after healing. That is wasted range, correct? Let us say if it overshoots by .5 after healing, then in Dr Zeiss's case it will still end up being +.3! However in Dr Rockstar's case it will end up being +.5!!!!!!Q4- What about if for far eye we aim for -.5 and it undershoots by .5, then it ends up being .-1 in the far eye!!!!! What does one see in distance if they have -1? Basically what I see with +1 readers?Q5- If I remember correctly. Dr Zeiss said the Zeiss lense's come is steps of .5. I think Sok's mentioned in one thread IOLs' come in steps of .3? Dr Rockstar did not mention the steps but he said that he can use Zeiss or Hoya. He said though that the Hoya's steps brings it more closer to plano than Zeiss's one. I assume their starting number are different even if they are both in .5 or whatever increments.Q6- If Dr Zeiss's recommendation of -.2 and -1.4 is taken (difference of 1.2 Diopter between the 2 eyes). Then if it overshoots .5 in opposite direction in each eye, then it could end up being a difference of 2.4 Diopter!!!!Although that will be taken into account when operating on the 2nd eye. Although Dr Zeiss even wanted to operate on both eyes together! As Sue said that shows why never to operate on both eyes at the same time.Jeez!!! ?"
Cataract,Non fluoroquinolone eye drops,Are there any antibiotic eye drops that are not a fluoroquinolone ?
Cataract,Gap of 1 month between operations. Need temp glasses? ,"As things stand, there will be 1 month gap between the two eye operations.Left eye- Very dense cataract. Will be operated first.Aim: - 1.6One month later Right Eye for :Currently right eye measurement isSpherical + 1.25Cylinderical -0.50Axis 112So after the left eye operation how will my wife carry on for a month? Will she need to wear temporary glasses or something?My wife has never worn glasses or contacts in her 40+ years on this planet!Will the right eye which has accommodation work with new left IOL eye without glasses?Confused!"
Cataract,monofocals,Assuming both eyes are set the same. has anyone picked close or medium distance versus the traditional full distance in both eyes? and why and were you happy with it? I will need glasses in any case I realize. ( can't do each eye different due to other complications).
Cataract,Cataract left eye,"Had cataract surgery 8/15/19. loi was set at -1.50. My vision is worse than before surgery. i have no close vision, and fuzzy distance vision. I Am currently nearsighted with bifocals. The post op visit yesterday revealed i still had swelling, and the epithelium cells on the cornea was "" roughed up"" Told it could take 3-5 days for the swelling to go down.Not even 60 hours from surgery, no excitement of bright , vivid colors.The PVD is worsen. scheduled for right eye on Friday. Will cancel that surgery.I Thought i did all my research, but no can "" see"" for you. Support is welcomes. i know i can't undo what has been done."
Cataract,Returning to fitness after cataract surgery? ,"Imagine someone does 12hrs of fitness a week, ranging from Yoga to high intensity cardio training to weight lifting.Obviously surgeon's recommendation at week one check up will be followed but how much break is normally required to be absolutely safe?Remember Dr Handstand said 1 day ?"
Cataract,Difference of 1.5 Diopter,"Where there is a difference of more than 1.50 diopters between the eyes post operatively glasses are often difficult or impossible to adjust to.I really don't get it fully! So if after cataract operation the difference is 1.5 diopter then the brain has issues to adjust, I get that. Something to do with the difference is size of the image that the brain is getting.So is it not an easy fix to use glasses to decrease the diopter difference?...glasses are often difficult or impossible to adjust to""CONFUSED"" Why????"
Cataract,Do measurments change?????? Really confused!!!,"Two months ago when wife got diagnosed with cataract the Ophthalmologist's measurements were-I don't have copy of measurements from the 2 surgeons we visited after that but I have the latest surgeon's measurements. I have attached them here as I find it all very confusing, they seem completely different? No?The only thing I can match is the eye pressure which was and still is 14."
Cataract,Cataract Surgery Bad Headaches at Temple of eye,What Could be the Cause of Bad Headaches After Cataract Surgery?I am a 60 year female and just over two week ago I under went cataract surgery on my right eye. I have developed extremely bad headaches behind my eye and reaching out to my temple. It doesn’t seem to go away with normal pain medicine. Could this be caused from some problem with the new lens? Will this in course go away as the eye heals and gets used to the focus and light? These don’t seem to be normal headaches – more like migraines although I have never had those before
Cataract,Zeiss Monofocal IOLs Hydrophobic vs Hydrophobic surface properties!!! Any thoughts?,"Based on the copy of the eye readings, it looks like our surgeon uses ZEISS CT ASPHINA 509 for Monofocal IOL. I shot him an email about ZEISS CT LUCIA.My two issues with the Asphina lens are-It is not 100% hydrophobic. Hydrophilic acrylate (25%) with hydrophobic surface properties (worried about glistening). The IOL will be used for few decades hopefully.If it is Hydrophilic Acrylate 25%, what is the rest?Does not have square edge design to minimize spread of PCO (wife is young so could end up being a mute point but still)The ZEISS CT LUCIA has a sophisticated 3 ?m radius sharp-edge design on the entire optic edge forming a barrier to prevent early cell migration and posterior capsular opacification (PCO)2. The proprietary lathe-cut manufacturing technology provides edge sharpness and integrity.Step-vaulted haptics are designed to maximize direct capsular contact. The C-loop shape combined with the reinforced haptic optic junction, has been developed to provide easy centering and reliable refractive predictability for your patients. The ZEISS CT LUCIA is made with ultra-high-purity hydrophobic acrylic material and a proprietary cryo-lathing process – supporting glistening-free lens properties.1,3,4 As a results postoperative refractive outcomes are very stable and long-term optical clarity is provided.1-5"
Cataract,Going with Dr Zeiss and Zeiss lens!!,"Sorry for another thread (won't be the last either ) lol. It helps me verbalise my thoughts plus someone else might benefit. Here it goes-After lot of yo-yoing between Dr Rockstar and Dr Zeiss, Dr Zeiss rose to the top. Operation date has been set for last week of September for left eye. One month later the right eye.We will be meeting him again in 11 days to talk one more time before the operation.Why did we pick Dr Zeiss over Dr Rockstar? (Both are highly qualified and were well recommended).1 - Soks and Viking picked him in the other thread (joking)2 - We sent an email to Dr Rockstar and Dr Zeiss with some follow up questions on Monday. Dr Zeiss replied at 9pm in the night i.e. outside working hours. Dr Rockstar has not replied so far. Even though the email went direct to him plus secretary printed a copy and put it on his desk. He might be super busy as a surgeon. Although Dr Zeiss was lot more busy from what we saw. Dr Rockstar might still reply but...it is too late now.3- Dr Rockstar wanted to do plano in the far eye, Dr Zeiss said he would never aim for plano due to possibility of overshooting and wasted range. This made me doubt Dr Rockstar a bit and it was part of my email question that he did not reply to so far.4a- Dr Rockstar's assistant Dr Career kind of spoilt the experience and muddied the water for us when we first visited their place. Plus on the day we finally got to meet Dr Rockstar, she was conveniently present looking for something when we entered the room and then left without acknowledging us.4b- Dr Career with her general behavior caused us more stress in a time when we were already very stressed.5- Dr Rockstar wanted to make left eye for far and said if both eyes were ok before the cataract then dominant eye should not matter. Dr Zeiss said dominant eye for far and guesses that wife being right handed it could be that her right eye is the dominant eye.*Although fact is that we don't know which one is dominant eye and post cataract we can't find out anyway.6 - Dr Zeiss does not care too much about time slots. If he is discussing then he is discussing. Which results in people waiting long for their turn in the waiting room. I prefer that to surgeons rushing patients out.7- Dr Zeiss loves to talk. He seems passionate about the field, with Rockstar it seemed there is more prestige and ego involved.8- Dr Rockstar's facial chemistry changed when we mentioned we still have another surgeon left to visit. I think his ego was bruised. Dr Zeiss on the other hand was completely carefree about that type of stuff. He even said, I am sorry that my fellow surgeons recommend plano. He even out of curiosity did not want to know name of the surgeon who wanted to do plano, which I liked lol9- Dr Zeiss's secretary was super nice, patience of an angel and seems like genuinely nice person.10- Dr Zeiss could easily have sold us EDOF or TRIFOCALs but he was honest and said that EDOF is not worth it over Mini-monovision. He said he got taken in by it but then he realised that with EDOF he was getting similar results to what he was getting with Mini-Monovision ten years ago. That was refreshingly honest. Irrespective of what we feel here about EDOFs.Anyway that is combined view of me and my wife. Some subjective some objective. It is what it is ?"
Cataract,Cataract surgery pain,How much pain will I have during and after cataract surgery ?
Cataract,Possible Early PCO in One Eye,"My vision with the PanOptix tri-focal has been improving -- don't really notice any change from day to day, but I can now read newspapers on the subway with relatively poor lightly.I had my one month follow-up appointment yesterday, and when testing each eye independently, and was surprised my left eye vision is not very good (cloudy on the letter charts).Surgery was done on my my right eye done first, with limbal relaxing incisions to address astigmatism. And my left eye a week later was borderline on whether limbal relaxing incisions would be enough, so a toric lens was used. My day after surgery follow-up showed excellent distance vision for each eye.Now, in the one month follow-up, right eye is still really excellent. But left eye vision not that good -- quite blurry on the letter charts. Not something I noticed with using both eyes. Checked for residual astigmatism, and that doesn't seem to be the problem. Doctor had me do a OCT scan to check the retina, and everyone looks good. So it may be PCO, as sometimes it can appear quickly.Plan is to have another follow-up appointment in another month.I think I should confirm that it's PCO and not something else and not the lens.I guess if it is PCO, and not something else, then YAG is the answer. But best to confirm it really is PCO."
Cataract,Ok going for Mini-Monovision...,"If you had to decide between these 2 very experienced professors/surgeons for mini monovision.Note- Left eye is with dense cataract, right eye with light cataract, but spreading fast.Right eye target: Minus 0.20Left eye target: Minus 1.40Difference of 1.2 DiopterIOL used- Zeiss MonofocolCon 1- Willing to do both eyes at same time, we won't though (but bit irresponsible of him, don't you think?)Con 2- Zeiss lens has only the coating that is hydrophobicCon3- Zeiss lens does not keep PCO at bay. He does not see that as an issue, if it comes after 1 year or 3 years it is going to come anyway according to him. Does not see YAG as an issue.He is experienced enough to do lens replacement on YAGed capsules!!!!!Right eye target: Minus 1Left eye target: PlanoDifference of 1 DiopterIOL used-HoyaCon1- Currently my wife's right eye is dominant but he is targeting left eye for plano. Left eye is with dense cataract. Does not see dominant eye thing as an issue for someone who had good vision in both eyes pre cataract.Con2- He is targeting plano in one eye. What if when IOL settles it over shoots by +.25 or +.5? Surgeon 4 said he would never target plano for mini monovision.Pro1- Suggested one eye at a time, with gap of 4 weeks or longer (if cataract spreads slower in the right eye).Pro2- Hoya lens has square edge and is Hydrophobic."
Cataract,Questions about the plus and minus on prescription,"I've spent a lot of time trying to figure this out and am still confused and quite frustrated with myself at the moment. I understand sphere, cylinder, and axis, but I get confused about what the plus and minus means, specifically with respect to the sphere.After my cataract surgery, my RE is .5 .5 127 (I wrote this down). I had thought that this meant that I was slightly myopic, but the doctor yesterday said that my surgery left me .5 diopters farsighted. I asked to be .5 diopters myopic for my new surgery (lens exchange) and he said the IOL power he would use would be targeting .4 diopters myopic. I thought I would get a pair of readers to simulate what my sight would be and here is where I get more confused. Readers are labeled with a plus. If I'm going from .5 to -.4, isn't that -.9? Would a +.75 or +1.0 reader simulate the target for my vision after the exchange?Thank you in advance!"
Cataract,Zeiss Monofocals.....Hoya,"These are Zeiss Monofocals!ZEISS CT LUCIA (came out in 2014-15 I think) and ZEISS CT ASPHINA ( No idea how old, I think older) If going with Zeiss, which would you pick?The other two Zeiss are not interesting as one is spherical and the other is 3 piece!In the other thread some of you said that you never heard of Hoya. I had many times and they are quiet big too.image"
Cataract,"Lara and Lisa, edof and trifocal mix and match iol - or not?","I started to write in another thread, but I guess it is better to start my own separate thread....So, 5 weeks ago I had the Zeiss Lara edof in my dominant eye, surgery went well, I am very satisfied, although near vision lacks a bit compared to what I would have liked.Today this eye was tested, at this point the iol have shot over the target by 0.5, which also explains why the near is lacking a little bit, even that real reading vision is not to be expected with this lens in any case.And right after checking the Lara eye, surgery was up for the second eye, and I needed to decide if I wanted another Lara, or a trifocal.Talk about dilemma, a Lara that hits the target or slightly under, would off course give better near vision than one that have hit over the target. And two eyes is better than one, so maybe this would be great, it probably would.But then maybe I would still feel I could have got more near with the trifocal, and I have sufficient far and midrange vision now with the Lara, so why only add more of the same.It did not make the choice easier knowing, that the first Lara had shot a bit over the target, and the surgeon really could not tell me anything I did not know already, that made it easier to make a choice.By the way, this time is was another surgeon, quite a bit younger, I would guess somewhere in his forties, where the other surgeon was in his sixties. But he seemed very confident, so it did not matter to me really.But - I went with the Lisa trifocal.Pros and cons go both ways, I guess only the result will tell me if it was the right decision.It is a few hours since I had the Lisa implanted, I am sitting at home drinking coffee, and just counting the minutes waiting for the pupil to retract, so can see the result, and waiting is killing me... ?Right now the pupil is almost bigger than the eye itself, they gave it some extra hardcore stuff because the surgeon was not satisfied with the pupil dialation to start with, so they gave it an extra punch.So I guess pupil will not retract before tomorrow, surgeon said it could make than 24 hours, I would have loved to tell the world how great the Lisa is right now, but I have no clue if it is good or bad, right now its all kind of blurry.I can read the screen, and see the keyboard, but it is blurry, almost making me a little bit dizzy if I only look with that eye.What I do notice, is that the text on the screen gets quite a lot thicker and almost seems bigger with both eyes, compared to only the Lara eye, so even that the Lisa image is blurry, it does add a lot to the picture in my head, funny how the brain works.But positive that the brain is already accepting it, and are combining the two images.I don´t have a feeling that there are more than one picture in the Lisa eye, but off course it is hard really to tell right now.Trifocals are known for long adaptation time, so I guess my result is pretty normal at this stage."
Cataract,Can anyone else see a pattern?,I have a pattern in my first cataract removed eye. I have tolerated it but it getting worse. It is like small oval rings in 3's. can see it on lite background. Could be my own blood?
Cataract,Flickering after Cataract Surgeries,"Similar to many posts on this website, I've had terrible flickering after cataract surgeries, starting in my left eye and moving to the right. Fluorescent lights are the worst and cause nausea, but any light source can trigger it. Similar to others, when I cover one eye, it goes away. It has been four months for me and if anything, the problem is getting worse. I can't go in stores and am always turning off lights. I work with computers and that is now problematic.I went to multiple doctors who found nothing wrong, very frustrating. However, on a recent appointment the doctor diagnosed the issue in about 10 seconds as Pseuodophakodonesis, a dislocated lens. He did it with a penlight in a darkened setting with lights to the left and the doctor was certain the 'flickering' I was seeing was actually the lens moving. I have a few appointments coming up, one with a neuro-opthamologist to discuss what to do.Some of the posts are years old, I am wondering how people are doing now?"
Cataract,"Visited Surgeon No.3, No 4 coming up next week, then we decide!","New thread to help me and any future cataract patients...So we visited Dr. Rockstar (very experienced Surgeon) today. When we entered his room the other assistant surgeon from previous visit was there but she left straight away. She did not acknowledge us though. Maybe was in her thoughts or intentionally from us rejecting her.He seemed more competent in his speaking and approach. Did not rush us in anyway. We feel he is the one that we might be going with. So if we go with him we will be doing left eye set to far and in the future right eye 1 Diopter closer. He thinks that will give us good quality of life with glasses mainly for reading.He himself uses same setup for his glasses.This surgeon was against Multifocal IOLs. He said if it was his own eyes, he would do what he suggested for us. He said Multifocals are a compromise in each distance range. He prefers older people getting it than younger ones as even though it is not super sharp in each range, it still ends up being an upgrade for older people (compared to their aging vision).For younger patients he prefers super sharp focus via Monofocals. So if we go with him we would be using the Hoya lens, he offered Zeiss too but recommended the Hoya as it brings the far vision closest to plano for the left eye, based on my wife's measurements.Btw he prefers EDOF over Trifocals.We said we are 99% going with him + mini monovision but that we are visiting another surgeon who prefers EDOF to get an opposing viewpoint just to cover all angles.He was ok with that but you could see that he was hurt. I think some of these top surgeons are just used to peopel bowing to them. Kind of makes sense, our eye doc who did pursue surgery initially and felt it was not for her, had told us that eye surgeons can be bit of Divas, as they are held in high prestige.P.S- I asked him about eye injection. He said that it is old skool and he would never inject the eye for cataract surgery. Why take such risks! Anyway we cancelled the OP with surgeon No.1.Surgeon No.2 was basically No.3's assistant who did all the measurements.So next week we see surgeon No.4 and that would be it. Unless No.4 knocks our socks off with EDOF, we would be doing mini monovision with Surgeon No.3."
Cataract,Normal 42 year old one week to Posterior Subcapsular Cataract next week.,"My wife is 42 and one week ago on waking up she saw blurry (more in left eye). We thought oily gland or something but it would not go away for almost the entire day.We thought she needed glasses so headed to eye doctor and she was diagnosed with cataract ""Posterior Subcapsular Cataract"" in BOTH eyes ?Now here vision is back to almost normal but if she covers the right eye there is still slight blur but not like the days this all started one week ago.She is not diabetic, nor a smoker, cortisol taker or alcohol drinker. Actually she is very sporty and healthy person. It seems it is genetic as her mum got it at 40 something too and grandfather too.We have initial appointment with eye surgeon in 2 weeks time and I am trying to get as much info as I can for this meeting and to make the right decisions for her. Hence I am here and have some questions-I am Europe if that is relevant and she does not drive-I will have more questions probably but THANKS YOU FOR ANY ADVICE!.."
Cataract,Eye drop vs Eye injection before cataract operation?,"So some surgeons seem to inject the eye to make it numb for the operation, others put drops? Why the difference?I get the impression that the injection could have side effects plus why inject if drops work too?"
Cataract,What causes gritty eyes?,After effects of cataract surgery. Why do I keep getting gritty eyes when I get the least bit emotional or stressed. When I get visitors etc. Will it calm down.
Cataract,Bad luck comes in 1...2....?,"You all seem to be my virtual friends so I thought I share some stuff with you. Cataract has indirectly another victim.I went to eye doc to get my eyes fully tested as my wife forced me to. This was my first ever full test.Good news-No cataract, glucoma etc eye pressure is in lower half of normal range, far vision 160% maybe better as she ran out of smaller letters.Neutral news-As suspected I have dry eyes and rough cornea. Nothing major but I have been given some sticky Bauch + Lomb gel with vitamin A.Freaked me out when I first tried it due to resulting bluriness. Got small glimpse of what you guys are going through ?Bad news-I have been diagnosed with""central serous retinopathy"" in my left eye!!!!I have small fluid built up behind my retina, right next to the macula ?The fluid is lifting my retina layer up, no breakage/leakage currently.In 2 months I have to go back and the eye doc thinks it would most likely be gone. If not and if it shifts, breaks or becomes larger then I am screwed ?Doc says the cause is stress, cortisol released by my body.Last 6 weeks as you know I havebeen super stressed due to my wife's cataract and I took it to my heart as she is my world.We both had come to terms with the cataract issue but now got hit by this.Somehow I have to relax in middle of all this to produce less cortisol!Ok I stop for now. In my next post I will list things I am trying to do to relax. Might help others too.P. S- Those who PMed me, I will reply soon."
Cataract,Maybe not Panic/Anxiety attack but....?,"Last few years I have had dry eyes, caused mainly by my eyelids opening slightly when I sleep. This results in my eyes drying out in my sleep and causing me to eventually wake up very suddenly with red gritty eyes and mentally super confused.When this happens I panic as even though I am awake, mentally I am not 100% awake. I live on the 4th floor and I always end up opening the flat window and sticking my head out or going to the balcony to get fresh air. In 3-5 mins I calm down and put some eye drops. This worries my wife in case I fall from the balcony and she ends up suddenly waking up too, following me and calming me down.In recent times I have stopped panicking because I got used to it a bit and did not see the point of worrying my wife in her sleep. So when it happens I just walk around the flat calmly, apply some drops and go back to bed in 5-10 mins.After my recent eye doctor trip, I was given a thick gel for my dry eyes. This made my vision blurry instantly and kind of covered my eyelashes with the sticky gel. This caused me to panic a bit first few times but I got used to it too.Last night though my wife went to toilet and that woke me up. I got up too and although my vision was not too blurry from the gel. I really took my panic stuff to another level!!!! I entered some sort of vicious circle where worrying about my eyes, my wife's cataract, meaning of life, not wanting to ever lose my wife, death, human mortality etc entered my mind. I felt like my heart was speeding up so fast that I would cause a heart attack or something! My legs felt very shaky (psychologically not physically). As my wife was awake she tried calming me but it just would not work.After 5-10 mins the drama was over an I went to bed. Wife could not sleep for a while as she was so worried. All this is not helping me not being stressed. I need to calm down due to the negative impact on my ""Central serous retinopathy"" that I was diagnosed with.Problem is that when awake I have calmed down but when waking up suddenly I seem to be not 100% mentally awake and can't apply logic until I full wake up, which seems to take round 5mins.Anyway I though I type it here just to get it off my chest."
Cataract,Trying to quickly wrap my head around my options,"Greetings,(Warning: long-winded background…)I'm a 52yo guy in the US who was recently diagnosed with cataracts - both eyes; developed over the course of several months; no real clouding, but enough distortion that I get triple vision and blurring that isn't correctable with glasses. The triple vision is more obvious at night with street lights. I have pretty-strong myopia (around -9, prior to the last ophthalmologist's altering my prescription before he actually detected the cataracts), but oddly-enough no notable prior astigmatism. I've worn prescription glasses full-time ever since I was nine.Due to my prescription (and the ease at which a lot of optometrists have screwed it up), I've gone to ophthalmologists for years. One thing that I couldn't help but notice is that most of my fellow patients have always been (well) in their 70s or older. Realistically, this generally means that the doctors are more used to dealing with patients who are at a different point in their lives. Even though I think that I've selected one of the top eye surgeons in my area, I therefore still want to ensure that we're both going into this with the appropriate perspective.All that out of the way, I want to make sure that I understand what's being proposed, and what my options are before the preop appointment later this month. As I understand it, my doctor is currently considering using the TECNIS ZCB00 for both eyes. He leans heavily toward monovision, but I'm supposed to wear a contact for a few days before making that determination. (Surgeries are only about a week apart.) He hasn't suggested the Symfony or a multifocal lens at this point. (I get the feeling that most doctors in the US shy away from these, due to bad experiences with first-generation multifocal lenses.)From what I've gleaned from here and elsewhere, here's what I think that I understand about single-focus lenses and extended focus lenses (please correct me if I'm wrong):Single-focus:Extended range (specifically Symfony):What am I missing? Overall, it seems like the big choices are related to focus coverage versus night-time effects."
Cataract,Having cataract surgery next week,i am due to have surgery next week can anyone tell me if my brain will adjust the sight in the other eye which is -12 and surgeon is putting in a -2 in the operated eye? Will need the other one doing eventually as that has a cataract as well
Cataract,Is Cataract Removal Without Lens Implant Possible??,"Hello,I am wondering if a cataract can simply be removed without having a lens implanted?Thank you."
Cataract,Seeing inside lens,re my previous message. 2 weeks after having my second cataract done I was putting a meat cutting board away in a tight place and felt something in my eye fall and stick in the bottom. when I was told about coverage of lens I saw what looked like a curved scar but think I must have burst a blood vessel at the top which had run down the lens as it had a bloblike drop in my lower eyelip area.
Cataract,Still depressed over my cateract surgery ,"hi every one been awhile since i posted. still seeing with wavy glare and blackish shadows . ReStore lens were used. didnt't know if someone knew if anything new is out there to help this problem . i can read , hem clothes cook drive some etc. km just sad about the glare and black shadows. had the YAG Surgeries , used hit rags to eyes etc. i passed the 20/20 vision line on DMV test and got my license renewed etc . if anyone knows anything new please post . thank you if you have the time"
Cataract,Need help to decide between monovision and mini-monovision,"I am 62 year old with a denser cataract in the right eye and less in the left eye. I have posted another tread with a question on whether I should get Symfony lens or not. I have decided to go with mono focal lens in both eyes. The input from everyone on this forum has helped me a lot in deciding. I have right eye cataract surgery scheduled for Friday, October 12th, 2018. My left eye surgery is on November 2nd, 2018.I went to my doctor's office for pre ops and also met him to discuss the right eye lens details. From what I had told him initially he had planned to do mini monovision for me. I asked him in terms of distance at which I will need to keep my cell phone to read clearly. He said it would need to be 18 inches from my face. He said I may need reading glasses for fine print. When I asked him how about making cell phone text readable at 14 inches. He said he agrees with me and he can do that but I will need to keep my computer closer than 26 inches.My current prescription details are as follows: OD: Sphere: -2.50 Cylinder: -0.75 Axis: 172 Add: +2.75 and OS: Sphere: -1.0 Cylinder: -0.75 Axis: 017 Add: +2.75.He said if we do cell phone reading at 14 inches it is mono vision and computer has to be moved closer. If we do cell phone reading at 18 inches it will be mini monovision. The computer can stay at 26 inches. I will need readers for fine prints.Based on my prescription and no other eye problems, can anyone suggest which way I would be better off? I am unable to decide whether to go with monovision or mini monovision. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks again for all your input so far."
Cataract,"UPDATE THREAD No. 3, July 25th (Wife's PSC) ","Today we met the very competent and empathetic eye doctor who had diagnosed my wife's PSC. Let us call her Dr Angel. We just needed to talk to someone and wanted a neutral opinion of our meetings with the 2 surgeons so far. Dr Angel has some past operating experience too but she moved away from it as it is not her thing and instead opened her own non operating eye clinic.Here is the conclusion of our meeting with Dr Angel...Miss Career was supposed to take the measurements only and pass us on to Rockstar surgeon for further discussions. This meeting with the Rockstar surgeon part never happened as she actually took full control over all decision making and did not even ask what my wife does for living. She obfuscated the part about who would be actually operating. From her only assisting, it turned out that she would actually be operating (when we contacted reception to find out next day).Dr Angel said no way should Miss Career operate, she might be good but still not as good or experienced as Mr Rockstar. For a young patient like my wife the risks are very high and an experienced surgeon is required. She said Miss Career can gain her experience with old patients.Miss Angel was also not happy about Miss Career dismissing Multifocals so readily as Mr Rockstar does lots of Multifocal IOL operations too.I think Miss Career is probably used to dealing with clueless old patients who go with whatever the doc says.Apparently he is a very good surgeon but he seems too old school for me. He also dismissed Multifocals and on being pressed by me actually showed me some older bifocals which according to him are the latest and the best when it comes to Multifocal IOLs. Deal breaker for us was him saying that my wife can do headstand 1 day after surgery as the operation cut is tiny. Tiny or not why risk it???Dr angel was not happy about him suggesting both eyes set to far. She said for a young person like my wife who had perfect, no glasses vision until few weeks ago, it would be very hard...not being able to put make up, cut nails etc.Make appointment with Surgeon 3 i.e. Mr Rockstar himself and discuss everything with him including Mulifocal IOLs even if we decide against them.Miss Angel also refereed us to a place with the latest and the greatest eye measuring equipment to get all the measurements done perfectly to be super sure. She also said that they will help with identifying dominant eye as it is an important consideration for choosing which eye to set for far if going with monovision/mini monovision option. Miss Career was in such rush that she did not even care about dominant eye part until we brought it up.Ok just needed to put today's meeting in words to clear my mind!"
Cataract,People and lack of empathy! ,"In real life we have not told many people that my wife has to operate on both eyes but the few we have told, their initial and delayed reactions have been truly eye opening...People that we have gone out of our way to help in their times of need have shown 0 empathy.A simple ""how are you feeling"", ""everything will be ok"" would have been enough.Instead for some reason they think we are interested in their temporary sore muscle related moans while they completely ignore my wife's eye issue.I feel like saying something to them but my wife says forget it, learn and move on.There have been couple of kind exceptions from people who are mere acquaintances.Anyway just needed to vent!!!!"

Cataract,Who has had an IOL exchange,I had my second cataract operation in June and have some scar tissue covering my lens and can't see out of my left eye. Am waiting for an appointment. Can anyone advise about eyes watering and how to stop it. I have been taking Dexafree eye drops since I had my first eye done in February and am worried about the steroids as I am taking Prednisolone 2mg for PMR. (Polymyalga Rhumatica)
Cataract,"Eye test chart, what am I understanding wrong?","On the day when my wife first noticed blurry vision the first time ever (4 weeks ago, wow! time flies).Her readings at the emergency eye doctor were-Left Eye +0.5 -0.75 137 °. (Very Dense Cataract, covering the whole rear of the lens)Right Eye +0.5 -0.25 103 °, (Fine Cataract)PLUS +0.5 (the first number) in both eyes means slightly far sighted, correct? (Although I always thought she reads closer better than far).2nd Number Astigmatism3rd Number angle of AstigmatismOk so just now I used Snellen test chart on her and her visionLeft Eye- 20/20 at best and 20/25 at worseRight Eye- 20/20 visionDo those readings say anything about being near or far sighted?"
Cataract,Cataract surgery choices when you also have astigmatism and lazy eye,Curious about options/results in the case of having/needing Cataract surgery in only one eye that also suffers from astigmatism and lazy eye?Which surgery/lens type did you go with (toric/basic...)?I currently wear glasses (progressive - due to my good eye having age related vision decrease) .Thank you!
Cataract, PCO prevention steps/ IOL choices!,"Ok this deserves it's own thread!Six Critical Factors that are key to preventing or retarding PCO.1- Hydrodissection-enhanced cortical cleanup2- A continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis diameter slightly smaller than that of the IOL optic3- “In-the-bag” fixation of the posterior chamber IOL1- The geometry of IOLs: a square, truncated edge2- The biocompatibility of IOL biomaterials (to curtail stimulation of cellular proliferation)3- Maximal IOL optic-posterior capsule contactDr. Apple singled out hydrodissection-enhanced cortical cleanup as the most important of these factors. “In my opinion, that’s 85 percent of it,” noted Dr. Apple. “If you clean out the cells really well, there won’t be any of them left in the capsular bag that can lead to a secondary cataract. You can even have a fairly mediocre lens and still not have PCO if you succeed with good cortical cleanup.”Since the availability of the first square-edged IOL in 1995, virtually all lens manufacturers have now introduced or are developing square- or sharp-edged IOLs. “The square edge acts as a barrier, preventing the migration of lens epithelial cells from the equatorial region onto the posterior capsule,” Dr. Werner added.Questions to follow ?"
Cataract,Scar tissue after cataract surgery,Just had cataract done and can't see because scar tissue has grown cover lense. what is the best treatment
Cataract,Why is my wife seeing sharper in the left eye again?,I understand that when both eyes are open...the better RE info + bad LE info + brain software = Better overall image.Today why is my wife seeing quiet sharp in the left eye again even when she fully covers the right eye? It is really confusing!She definitely has cataract as 2 different surgeons + 1 eye doctor have seen and confirmed it. Also our GP saw it with his special torch (without dilation).Apparently the LE has dense cataract and covers the whole rear of the lens (PSE)!Is this normal?
Cataract,Zeiss AT Lara edof (like Symfoni) implant,"Hi thereYesterday I had the Zeiss At Lara implanted i my dominant eye, in about 5 weeks the other eye will be done.I am born with cataracts in both eyes, so I have never had good vision, so my experience might be different than others that chooses this lens.For me the result is absolutely fantastic!I am almost embarrassed to tell about it in this forum, because I have seen so many people having big problems with their lenses, and I feel so sorry for those who have these problems, but for me this lens have invited me into a world I have never been in before, I really feel that I have landed on another planet in a science fiction movie.Everything about my vision have changed so much, almost kind of psychedelic, but in a good way off course.Contrast is unbelievable, in the sunlight I have never before been able to see what is in the shadows, now I see everything.Colors are almost exploding, all colors are so bright and deep, even black is more black.My perception of depth is very different, it feels like I have been living in 2D and now it has become 3D.I see details I have never seen before, some of them needs a little time to get used to, like grey hair and dust, that suddenly was present after the surgery ?Also my hands have become very ugly i think, but off course it is a part of the package.My distance vision is great, it is very clear 20/25 and still improving by the hour (before it was 20/40 on a good day in the right lighting), reading vision is not quite there being a little blurry, and off course real reading vision is not to be expected from the At Lara, but I can read J3 without glasses, and with cheap reading glasses J1 is razor sharp.I have never had real reading vision like this before, with or without glasses, all my life I have read papers by making a funnel with my fingers and looking though the hole between the fingers reading one word at a time.It is not even 24 hours since surgery, so I guess many things might still change.On pc screen with black background and clear white text (that I have used all my life because of the cataracts) there is a bit of glare around white text, but I see great anyway, and I expect it to go away - but it does not really bother me that much if it stays.Other than that, I have not noticed any side effects during daylight.I took a walk yesterday when it was dark, about 8 hours after surgery, so I guess it can change a lot.Around lights that are near to me there was a little bit of glare, lights that was a bit further away had a little bit of starburst, lights even further away had nothing.But the glare and starburst are kind of vague, and I can still easily see the lamp that are lighting through the glare/starburst, and none of it is bothersome at all.Apart from that, night vision is pretty fantastic, I never new that other people can see this much in the dark, I almost felt like they had giving me the eye from a cat or something ?With just a little bit of streetlights I could see the entire road and all the details on the road, just like it was not really dark, even that it was, so I will have no trouble at all driving or whatever in the nighttime.For me this At Lara lens feels like the perfect choice, I feel very lucky, the contrast sensitivity/loss is similar to monofocals, but still it can make up to +2, so you can get by on a daily basis without reading glasses, but I guess if you are a bookworm, and read a lot on a daily basis, you might find the reading ability lacking a little without glasses.Anyway, that was my store, I really can not wait with the second eye, but Zeiss can not deliver the lens before, it is being made to my measurements, so I guess I just must be patient ?CheersChristian"
Cataract,Complications from YAG capsulotomy?,"i had this procedure yesterday because I mentioned to my doctor that my vision through my new Symfony lens was not as sharp as my other eye which has not been altered. He said my sac that remained from my procedure that now contains the new lens can cause this and performed this procedure right then. Well, within ten to fifteen minutes afterwards I could hardly keep my eye open much see out of it. I called when I got home with my concerns and symptoms and was told to use my drops and it should be fine in the morning. Well, it is not fine. I still have blurred vision and what little improved vision I got from the Symfony has now deteriorated! I feel like I have something in my eye like a lash would feel. This is not a floater which is the usual side effect. Very concerned now about my eye condition. Have another appointment today to see what is up. Anyone else have anything like,this happen as a result of YAG?"
Cataract,"Visual artist and dancer need good vision, what lense to choose?","I’m recently diagnosed with having cataract. I’m only 52, and working full time as information technology professional. I’m also a visual artist, doing a lot of paintings in my spare time, both portrait and scenic painting, and plan to turn into a professional artist at age 55 after early retirement. On top of that, I’m also a dancer in a local performing group(non professional though), and perform on formal stages several times a year. With all these great things going on in my life, I am now facing the cataract surgery. Honestly, I’m pretty depressed after heard it from my eye doctor two weeks ago.Now I am here to look for help. With strong desire to see clearly in distance, close up for painting and computer work, and be able to dance on stage, what type of lens I should choose? I’m very near sighted, have astigmatism and already need reading glasses for a few years.I learned that multi-focus lens have big risk of having glare and halo issue post surgery, and wonder if I choose one of the mono kind, will I still be able to dance with the mono lens? And how either choice will affect my painting, with both distance, mid-range and close up vision need? If I have a distance vision, does that mean I can’t put up make up myself anymore? So many unclear questions.If you have any input which can relate to this, please share. Many thanks!"

Cataract,Cataracts lens exchange mix and match,"Hi thereFirst of all - sorry for my English, I live in Denmark ?I have read some of the threads in this forum - and thank you all for sharing your experience, so others like me have some help making this big decision ?I live in Denmark, here we can get almost any lens from the worldwide marked, I think Ziess and Tecnis are the most common used lenses.I am 45, and I was born with cataracts in both eyes, my eyesight is quite bad actually, but until now no one have been able to measure my eyes, or take a picture of the retina, because my cataracts are too dense to look through, so no one have been able to tell me, what I could benefit from a lens exchange, so I have not been too keen to jump on the boat.But two days ago I did find an eye clinic, that had some new expensive very fancy equipment from Zeiss in Germany, that was able to measure my eyes and take pictures of the retinas. And the surgeon finds that retinas looks fine, and he predict I can get a solid result with a lens exchange.He has been very honest about risks, possible side effects and so on.I have booked lens exchange in two weeks from now, and I honestly almost can not sleep, I am way too excited, this is something I have hoped for all of my life ?The lenses I am going to have is based on the mix-and-match strategy, and off course I am very excited to see the result, but really, almost anything is better than what I have had all of my life, so I am easy to please.I will have the Zeiss AT Lara in my dominant eye, the known advantage of this lens is relative few side effects, and low contrast lost, you could say a relative safe bet for the dominant eye.And in the fellow eye I will be getting the Zeiss AT Lisa Tri, that if the eye turns out to be good and accept the lens well, I can get some better reading sight on this eye, and off course the rest of the way it should support the dominant eye.I have not seen this combination mentioned on this forum, but I have read many cases on other forums, often people have very good results.Somehow it is like people ""only"" have the side effects from the lens with the fewest side effects, but often have the best side of both lenses, because they compliment each other and the brain chooses the best of both worlds - a bit strange, but if it works, i will take it ?Off course both eyes needs to be good, for this to work , I am not naiv, I know everything have two sides, but we will see in two weeks - I really wish it was tomorrow....If anyone have any experience with the type of mix and match, off course I am eager to hear about it.CheersChristian"
Cataract,42 year old wife's Posterior subcapsular cataract (PSC) - Part II,One of the reader suggested I start a second thread as the other one has become very long ?Q1- Is Mini-Monovision and Micro-Monovision same thing?Q2- To be classed Mini-Monovision is there a min/max range of diopter difference between both eyes that needs to be achieved?I am so drained!!!!!
Cataract,Have I got negative dysphotosia,"About 3 months ago I had a cataract operation on my right eye. I have seen two consultants in the UK, neither mentioned negative Dysphotopsia. However I am due to have the left eye done in two weeks and on the consent form it stated that there were two risks. one was an enlarged pupil and the other was dysphotopsia.The symptoms of this complaint is normally a crescent shaped dark image in the peripherals of the eye.My image is different, I see a complete dark eye shaped image in low light in the centre of my vision.I would like to hear from anyone who has this complaint what was the image they saw?"
Cataract,Problems adapting to my Zeiss LISA trifocal IOL's,"Hi,I recently had dual IOL's. My first operation was on the 9th May 2018, the other on the 16th.The first worked at distance as well as my glasses the following day, but even now, almost a month later, I have no close or intermediate clarity with it.The second, unfortunately started working with near vision first, which has proven quite distracting when trying to view anything at distance. It feels like I'm wearing glasses with a lens missing. Somewhat bizarrely the same isn't felt when reading, despite having no close or middle range clarity with it.Now my surgeon assured me there's a period of ""neuroadaptivity"", which can vary from patient to patient, with time being a factor also, but I'm aware there appears to be absolutely no improvement in either eye.I guess I wanted to hear if anyone else has had similar problems, did it rectify itself with time, how long did it take, or did it require another operation?I appreciate that I might be expecting too much too soon, but this is my vision after all, and I feel being a little concerned is entirely normal. Thanks in advance for any feedback."
Cataract,Cataracts with recurrent Iritis (Uveitis),"I have had episodes of Uveitis for 20 years now and the steroid drops I've had to use have caused cataracts in both eyes. I can't have the worst cataract removed until I go a year without Uveitis, which may be soon, but I have read that the operation itself often causes inflammation in cases like mine.I'm wondering if anyone knows how often cataract surgery is successful in cases of chronic Uveitis.My vision is steadily getting worse because of the cataracts so I'm getting quite worried."
Cataract,How do we test mini-monovision etc before any IOL operation?,"Many people say test monovision/mini-monovision via contacts/glasses before operating. How do we go about doing that?My ""young"" wife, both eyes have cataract and has never worn any glasses or contacts-It seems RIGHT eye is dominant or has taken over the dominance due to having better vision.Actual numbers that I have currently-**Left Eye **40% to 80% vision depending on source.Subjective refractory values from the left +0.5 -0.75 137 °.**Right Eye **100% visionSubjective refractory values from the right +0.5 -0.25 103 °Now in the above case how do we test mini monovision? What kind of glass or contact should we get to get similar feeling as mini-monovision?I will ask the surgeon tomorrow but get the feeling they are more interested in operating and just go with the flow than making us decide what choices are good in the long term."
Cataract,Drawings of my positive dysphotopsia with Tecnis ZKB00,"Hi there,Just figured I'd share what I was (am) seeing with my Tecnis ZKB00 +2,75 lens in my non-dominant eye, with a worsening cataract in my dominant eye that has it measured at -2.5 correction needed (and pretty dramatic light effects with the cataract too...but these drawings are what I saw with just the ""fixed"" eye looking).I was quite frustrated for weeks and so I drew what I was seeing (couldn't take a picture or a screenshot of it!).So I've attached the images I drew over the first few weeks, in case it helps anyone compare to what they are seeing.My visual acuity is fantastic with that eye, but the light effects include when I look at the stars and moon. ?FYI, since people may be curious... I am considering options for the second eye, will likely get monovision for distance (or maybe just a touch undercorrected if I think I'll keep this multifocal in). If that settles these light effects down, I may stay put with that combination because I might be able to get by daily tasks like grocery shopping and phone checking without reading glasses...and just need one-sided readers for long periods of near work. If I still get halos when I look at the moon and stars, then this multifocal will have to go and I'll go for monovision of some sort.Hope this is helpful. It would be fun/interesting if others wanted to doodle what they are seeing and post them in the comments...1000 words..."

Boy was I wrong lol So it basically rips open the capsule with IOL being held just around the edges. All those flaps just hanging and the broken bits just floating around!Don't you notice those flaps and floating pieces all the time? Also does it not severely increase the chance of IOL popping out?"
Cataract,Unilateral IOL replacement with naturally healthy second eye.,I have developed a cataract in my left eye due to blunt trauma.my doctor recommends a symfony edof in that eye.My right eye is completely fine and healthy. i never had to wear wear glasses(need them for the left eye after injury)anyone have the experience with symfony in one eye and completely fine natural second eye?is it a good choice? or should i stick to aspheric monofocals.i would like to keep playing football(soccer) and need to be spectacle free for that Don't mind wearing glasses for reading.also if anyone would like to share their experience with monofocals. what all tasks they can perform comfortably without glasses. I am 27 now.
Cataract,cataract surgery in young age ,"Hi all.I am 40 years old and I was undergoing cataract surgery a month ago with multifocal Alcon Panoptix lenses. Before that, I was short-sighted (-7), subcapsular cataract progressed very quickly. Now my distance vision is 20/20, i can also read fine print. But i am still very depressed that I had the operation at such a young age. Maybe who has similar experience and had this procedure in young age? Thank you for reading my post."

Diagnosis with Anterior Basement Membrane Dystrophy (ABMD)Expected to wear glasses to correct near and distance. Will target intermediate , goal of -1.5.Has any one has this problem? If so , what was your recommendation?"
Cataract,Replace IOL instead of capsulatomy,"Is there a doctor in Florida who has successfully replaced an IOL?I would rather slip the YAG, after reading it might not work."
Cataract,WAS MY CATARACT SURGERY PREMATURE???,"Hi all!!I initially had above average close vision but somewhere in my 40s distances became a bit difficult and I was prescribed bifocals with clear glass bottoms. I then required glasses to drive but improvement in distance vision and minor deterioration close up reversed this. My 10 year of diabetes has seen my eyes examined annually then 6 monthly as other issues surfaced. Cataracts, Epiretinal Membrane (shadows on the orange with red lines image) and a slowly growing hole in the centre of the retina image.At my latest review I was advised to have the cataracts attended to. I was told after this procedure I would require glasses to read. As I did not do much personal reading I went ahead without sufficient thought. Pre surgery I was content with vision, only requiring glasses when clarity for long vision was required. I could perform everything close without aid except for small print when magnification was required.Now 4 weeks post second eye-op I am struggling with everything within arms length which is really where we live. Little or no improvement is expected. Hundreds of things I used to do I cannot without the size 2s they gave me. These obtain clarity at only a definite specific distance and while I have them on everything else is a blur. I have to hang them low and look above for any distance. While I needed glasses before only on specific occasions I now need them handy 24/7. Apparently the membrane problem prevented the implant of multi-focal lenses. This is apparently also applicable to certain occupations.On the plus side white is whiter, blue bluer and the things at a distance I needed assistance to see clearly are now possible without. Not much of a beneficial trade for what I have lost. I don’t know what technicians learn from all the “which dots are clearer A or B” but I feel some evaluation of my extreme loss of overall vision should have been possible to give such advice and recommendation when so little cataract effect was there. I know something had to be done some time if I lived that long but believe technician remuneration may have been an issue.Has anyone any information on likely timing of cataract causing vision loss and if there is any experience or evidence of over-servicing and profiteering in this area.Barrie Heslop (in Oz)"
Cataract,Dry Eyes after Cataract Surgery,I am 4 weeks post op from getting my first eye done. I never suffered from dry eyes before surgery but it is now dry eye. I have just been using Blink artificial tears for mild-moderate dry eyes; the optometrist gave me a sample after my surgery. That doesn't seem to be helping much. Any suggestions on what works well? And do you think it will go away? I also had a limbal relaxing incision (LRI) for astigmatism. Thank you in advance.

Cataract,"UK 60 Year Old, Considering Lens Exchange - Zeiss AT Lisa vs Zeiss AT Lara?? Input much appreciated!","I'm UK based, 60 years old and am getting particularly fed up with constantly swapping glasses (distance / reading) - I have tried varifocals, but can't seem to get on with them.Last week I met with Optegra, an organisation that does laser and lens surgey - they have said I am an ideal candidate for lens exchange, and the surgeon specifically mentioned Zeiss Lisa tri focals as his favoured product.However, I really like the sound of the Lara's, particularly if they give me less issues at night. I'm also a keen golfer, and I think the progressive nature of the Lara technology would be better for golf.Any comments or input much appreciated!!Thanks ?"
Cataract,AT Lara or AT Lisa - what are they like?,"Hello everyone,I have been diagnosed with cataracts and because I am not very comfortable using glasses (my work requires a lot of switching between near and distant, plus needing a good level of colour and contrast vision) I asked the surgeon for suggestions. He said that the AT Lisa is his preferred choice of multi-focal with very good results and that he would recommend them. He suggested that I research them to find out more - which I did, and obviously saw all the research that suggest less contrast sensitivity and night time issues. I then saw the opthalmologist for the biometry and he said, based on my job, that multi-focals were a) not as good as mono-focal lenses 'whatever you read online' and then suggested the AT Lara as a compromise with excellent quality of vision similar to mono-focals, although without the near focus capability of the AT Lisa. Then he suggested I research them online... You see where this is going... Now I am very confused, does anyone have experience of either of the two different lenses? Is there a significant loss of contrast? What is the near vision like with the AT Lara? I know any answers are very dependent on the individual, but I am just trying to get an idea of people's experience instead of the technical data which is all quite difficult to interpret.Thanks in advance, for any advice or opinions."
Cataract,iol EDGE-GLARE anyone?,"The term ""edge glare"" (edge-dysphotopsia) can relate to many problems. Usually it's light on the side of the eye (a window during a sunny day, a lamp on the bedside table in the dark room, ceiling lights in shops) causing the side of the eye flickering, seeing half-arcs, peripheral glare/flare. All things never happened when I had my natural lens and it's my curiosity to know why this is happening to some people and some don't. It's usually goes away if u cover your sides with hand, so the light MUST coming from the side to produce that annoying condition. But it's really something related to the edge of the lens? Or the reflective index of it? Have read tons of researches showing that the problem is absolutely caused by the truncated edges of the iol and a high-reflective lens doesn't help either because reflects badly the light inside, making it bouncing internally.Any thought? Experiences with that? Did someone solve the problem by changing the lens for a ""less problematic"", with different features and design?

Cataract,Symfony multifocal - night and low light vision issues,"Hi,My name is Claude and I am a 47 yrs old male and 2 yrs ago I had the Symfony Multifocals in both eyes. It took some time to get used to them and I see almost perfect during the day when natural light is available. For reading I uses some cheap OTC ( +2). The issue with these lenses is at night (or dusk) when I drive.My vision becomes unclear ... a traffic light in the distance at night doesn't have straight contour around the lights and is a bit blurry. I don't even know what to call that optical illusion.Or if a go to Costco and all those ceiling artificial lights give me a headache and dizziness and everything seems weird.After a few complaints my doctor proposed to change my predominant eye from a Symfony multifocal to a monofocal lens. But he warned me I would lose close and intermediate vision in that eye.... which now I am afraid and confused. So its a trade off ... Question is what to do?what do you think? what would you choose?A slight better night vision or a better close/midrange daytime vision?I guess a 3rd option would be to take both Symfony out and replace them with simple monofocal and use progressive glasses.thank you all for helping me in this so complicated decision."

Cataract,Edge Glare after Surgery,I like to hear from members that had cataract surgery at least 6 months ago and suffered from edge glare after the surgery. I'd like to know if it ever went away on it's own and if so how long did it take before it was no longer noticeable.
Cataract,Glare causing migraines,HelloI have cataracts which are not causing problems with my sight but are causing problems with glare which is giving me frequent migraines lasting four days. The optician said the cataracts are mild and not to go to the GP. I went to the GP about the migraines but he said the only answer is cataract surgery but that I need an optician referral. I feel stuck between the two but the migraines are badly affecting my day-to-day life. Polaroid prescription sunglasses and avoiding many places with bright lights helps but is restricting my activities. Does anyone else have migraines?
Cataract,What could this be on my iris?,i randomly took a picture of my eye and noticed this on it. my vision isn't blurry and i took a few because i thought maybe it is from the lighting but its not. it looks like it could be a cataract but i am only twenty two. im going to make an appointment to see an eye doctor tomorrow but i have the worst anxiety over this so i need something to ease my mind
Cataract,AcrySof Toric Monofocal Experience,"Hi. This is for anyone who might be weighing IOL choices prior to surgery and wants to know more about the toric monofocal specifically. Some really lovely people (for whom I am so grateful) have really helped me on this site, and I would like to pay it forward.To start, I am 48 and have a genetic predisposition for early-onset cataracts. I have had no eye injuries and no eye disease. I do have astigmatism. I only had a cataract in my right eye, which gave me 20/400 vision uncorrected, and 20/200 vision corrected, so I was legally blind in that eye, and surgery needed to be done. The doctor said he saw the beginning of a cataract in my left eye and anticipates lens replacement in approximately 3 years.I am a SAH, home schooling mom. My favorite activities are reading, writing, and crafting, so I do a lot of close work. Even so, I chose a monofocal lens set for distance. I didn't choose a multifocal for 3 reasons (in order of importance):I am odd in that I did not really want to stop wearing glasses, because, frankly, I look better in glasses. I could have chosen the non-toric monofocal but, ultimately, I felt that (for me) vanity was a poor reason to sacrifice the convenience of not wearing glasses full time and the chance to see God's natural world again without frames in my peripheral vision and with proper depth restoration. (They have filmed several movies in my area due to the rare and beautiful environment, and I really want to gaze upon it again with unimpeded vision.) I could have gone with the non-toric monofocal that insurance covers and then worn contact lenses, but I have never worn a contact, and I did not want to go through the trouble of IOL implantation and then place another synthetic lens on the external surface of my eye. For me, ""enough is enough,"" so I killed 2 birds with one stone and opted for toric. I will still require reading glasses, so I joke that I will look better half the time. I realize that requiring reading glasses qualifies as a pretty big ""drop"" in my field of vision (see number 2 above), however, it does not come with a statistically high risk of night vision disturbances, so it's a compromise. I also realize that the same risk of needing to wear glasses anyway (number 3 above) applies, but I won't resent it as much as I would have if I had paid for it with my night vision and $6,000 for both eyes, eventually, in multifocals. I did what, for me, felt like a good balance. I did not ""go for it"" with a multifocal, and I did not ""settle"" for uncorrected astigmatism. I took what was, for me, a moderate approach that fits with my situation and certain aspects my personality.A couple things to note:Having astigmatism means that my reading glasses are also prescription. If I lose them or leave them at a restaurant or friend's house, I can't read until I get them back from wherever I left them or have a new pair made. Having a toric implant means I will likely get to wear non-prescription readers which are cheap, widely available, and don't pose any risk to my night vision. I should add that, for all my concern about night vision, I don't drive at night or have a night-related career. I do drive at night occasionally, and I do walk at night, and there are streetlights which I did not want to look at and see halos or webs, etc. I mainly wanted to reduce the risk of permanent visual disturbances period.Regarding the surgery, I had dropless (no post-surgery eye drops) and ORA, because my regular optometrist (not my eye surgeon) strongly recommended it and because:""For the first time in medical history, cataract surgeons have the on-demand ability to measure outcomes, correct astigmatism and verify lens implant calculations in real time during cataract surgery with the introduction of Optiwave Refractive Analysis (ORA). This technology is one of the most dramatic breakthroughs in intraoperative cataract care in the past two decades.""For a week I need to wear an eye shield when I sleep, but that's it..I just had the surgery yesterday morning. It took 30 minutes and was a fun and interesting experience.. Fun because, let's face it, legitimate narcotics are relaxing, and it was interesting, because I could see what I assume to be the broken pieces of my lens swirling around in the light in my eye. I made a remark during surgery and was told not to talk, so make note of that-- no conversations during eye surgery when they are trying to keep your head as still as possible. That should have been obvious, but, yanno...drugs.Post surgery my eye hurt. I was told it would be mild pain. No. It was downright painful. It felt like my eyeball had a bad sunburn and like I had something in the middle of my actual, internal eyeball. I can't describe it other than to say it felt like an acrylic lens was implanted in my eye. I still have the sensation of that ""fullness"" in my eye. It's novel, but not too creepy or bothersome. Instead of taking an ibuprofen I went out for lunch with my husband and then took an all-day nap. 19 hours later my eye is slightly sealed from the excretion response to the trauma of surgery and sleeping so long. I am not forcing it open, because it feels better shut, and I am not anxious to see out of the eye, because I know my post-op vision is jacked up and it's way too soon to tell. I am not in as much pain.Current emotional impressions:I saw some light aberrations while traveling to the restaurant. Bright sun glinting off cars, headlights, and that sort of thing produced starbursts and halos. The restaurant was dark and had recessed lighting and white Christmas lights too. There were halos around points of light, and the recessed lighting looked like big white ""snowballs"" with halos around them. Because of this site, I knew to expect all this and that it will most likely go away in time. Thus it did not bother or frighten me one bit. But after seeing these aberrations I am kind of second-guessing myself thinking I could have dealt with spiderwebs/halos, etc. and probably been OK with a multifocal. Still, my husband saw about 5 friends he knew while waiting for me to come out of surgery. One of them, said he got the multifocal implant 9 years ago but now needs glasses again. So then I also started second-guessing myself about even getting the toric monofocal, thinking maybe I shouldn't have spent any money if I'm just going to need to again wear glasses for everything in the future. So I'm kind of all over the place right now. Hopefully at some point I will settle in and be confident about the choice I made. It's hard to really know, since there are so many variables, and we can't try each option out before we decide. At any rate, I am grateful that ANY options exist to help with cataracts. I have lots of experience with health conditions that have no available treatment, so the fact that anything can be done for a cataract is a wonderful gift."
Cataract,when do you need an IOL exchange ,"I had cataract surgery and one eye is OK but the other did not work. I went back to my surgeon but he said did everything correctly and the fact that I could not see, read or focus mainly was due to the health of my eyes. I checked with my retina doctor and he said my retina was healthy. I went back to my surgeon and he suggested I go for a second opinion.At this point, I could read some print but images were blurry if they were further than arm length. Of course I could not read road signs or TV captions . By now the focus problems were worse because I was constantly seeing double images. It was almost five months after my operationThanks to the information I got from Julielyn I was able to find a wonderful doctor in Florida who tested my eyes thoroughly and found that I needed an IOL exchange. So here I am preparing to have this procedure that will restore my vision as it was before the cataracts. So thanks Julielyn, SueAn2 and Hudsongrl for all the support and feedback during all these five months when I was so confused and needing a kind suggestion. I will keep you posted."
Cataract,Does anyone have one intermediate and one near distance Toric IOL ,"I have been doing a lot of searches but have not come across this combination. I had a carl zeiss toric lens set for intermediate distance put in my left eye after cataract surgery in 2013 in Australia. I now need my right (dominant eye) done.I am living in the US and my ophthamologist I have seen here uses Alcon toric lenses. He said I could have either distance or near but that it was up to me.Has anyone had the combination of toric IOLs with intermediate and near distance?Also, i have not met my deductible on my insurance so have been quoted $3500 - $5000 for the surgery and $1400 for the lens. Does this sound ballpark price?Thanks for any input"
Cataract,Problems with IOL?,"Hi. I had an AcrySof monofocal set for distance implanted in my right eye a week ago. My distance vision has been crystal clear in that eye until yesterday and today. It seems to be getting worse. Distance is a little blurry now, in that eye, and I'm seeing double stoplights (green is really bad, red is OK). I feel like I need glasses. Kind of disappointed in spending $2K just to need glasses for distance a week later. Is this normal?"
Cataract,PanOptix Trifocal Toric IOL implant,"I am a 47 year old male who has noticed a quite sudden decline in my eye sight the last 12 months or so. I have had PRK in my left eye some years ago. My right remains untreated but I have been using contact lenses for 30 plus years.My ophthalmologist told me about 7 months ago that i had cataracts and upon my return visit recently, (and a continual noticeable reduction in sight) he has told me i require cataract surgery.He suggested that I choose between trifocals and mono focal IOL's. He said it would be less easy to get my sight correct in my treated eye.I have been told that they choose Alcon Panoptix trifocal IOL's.I would really prefer to see all distances unimpeded by spectacles but am not sure what to do after reading this forum. I dont know my exact current measurements but with my contact lenses in can read about 20/50 but not clearly.Anyone have any idea on these IOL's?I'm from Australia, btw. Thanks, Dan. ."
Cataract,Confused About IOL Choices,"Hi, everybody. I apologize in advance for the Great Wall of Text. I know it can be seen from outer space, cataracts or no, but I really need your help and hope you will forgive me.I am 48 and have been in glasses since age 20. I have significant astigmatism in the right eye and have been wearing prescription reading glasses for the last 10 years. 3 years ago my prescription was updated, but I couldn't see well. A month later I had my eyes checked again, and the prescription was very different. Investigation showed fast-progressing posterior cataract. Today I have 20/200 vision in the cataract eye and pretty good vision in left eye with glasses. The cataract eye is rife with light disturbances at night. I can see 5 or more of each light-related image (such as road reflectors and reflective signs), and all lights are J-shaped ""halos"" with glare everywhere. The left eye is fine, but the doctor says he sees a ""blister"" which he deems the beginning of another cataract and says I will need to have it replaced in 3 years.For now, he offered me 3 choices:I don't know much about these options, and they didn't tell me. He said there are no bad choices, but he did highlight the ""premium"" lenses. The difference presented was:NOTHING was mentioned about light phenomena at night or pros and cons/tradeoffs. Just that it would ""be a shame"" to put 48-year-old eyes in the basic monofocal IOL, and if I have the funds I should consider a premium IOL. The scheduler said that whatever I put in my right eye I will need to put in my left later. They wanted to schedule me right then and there. I said no and went home to research.It took me 3 days to even find a forum where real people talk about their real experiences, blood, guts, halos, and all. I've read articles galore and still feel I am no closer to understanding or making such a HUGE choice. I sure would appreciate your help.A little more about my personality:Some QuestionsMany, MANY thanks!?"
Cataract,Unusual Shapes in eyes going from light into dark and dark into light.,"I had a cataract in my right eye removed 5 weeks ago in a UK hospital. My vision in daylight is first classI did have a slight problem a couple of days later which was apparently due to post operative inflammation which cleared up with an increase in drops.After about a week I developed a real problem during dusk and darkness. No problem till I go to bed. As most elderly men I have to go to the toilet a couple of times at night. I go from the dark bedroom into the bathroom and switch the light on. Immediately I see in my affected eye a large, solid, black eye shape appear in my central vision. (this is not a floater). As my eyes accustomise to the light, the image disappears. When I return to the bedroom and switch off the bathroom light and return to darkness, the shape reappears but this time it is a whitish colour and again gradually disappears.I have seen the surgeon (of 25 years of cataract removal) who did the operation who has no answer for it. He said that my eye is perfectly healthy and hopefully!!! might just go away.I must not be the only person in the whole wide world who has experienced this.Any comments would be appreciated."
Cataract,Two weeks out from having second eye cataract surgery and having peripheral vision issues ,"ok so I had the second surgery and have a near vision toric lens with correction for my astigmatism. I feel as though I should be delighted. I do not need any glasses for distance and that vision is perfect, no longer an issue. I also can read perfectly, however I do have significant floaters and constantly see something like a liquid wall on the periphery of my near vision eye. It eventually tires me and is pretty annoying. Am I just being impatient? Will it get better? Or do I need to adjust? And be happy with what I have? I honestly don't know what is the responsible approach."
Cataract,Arc of Light in Dark Room,"I am a 68 year old male who had cataract surgery in December. I now have an monofocal IOL set for distance in my right eye. My vision in this eye is now 20/20. I am very happy with the results. I will have the other eye done at some future date when my other cataract gets worse.Last night I noticed a bright arc of light in the eye that had the new IOL. When I move my eye to the left and then to the right I can see the arc of bright light on the outer edge of my eye. I can also see it, if I just turn my head while staring straight ahead.The arc of light is visible only in a dark room or when I close my eyes. Otherwise, I do not notice it. It does not affect my vision.I have had floaters for many years. However, I have not ever had an arc of light such as this. I first noticed it last night. It would be appreciated if someone could offer their opinion on what it might be and would welcome all comments or suggestions.Thank You,Greg"
Cataract,Photophobia after cataract surgery,I HAD CATARACT SURGERY 3 AND 2 MONTHS AGO ON BOTH EYES I AM HAVING FOLLOWING PROBLEMSWHAT COULD BE THE CAUSE AND SUGGESTED REMEDY
Cataract,Problem with bright lights after surgery,"I just had surgery this morning and everything went well. They replaced one of my lenses with a mono-focal lens set for intermediate so I could have blended vision. The surgeon seems to have hit the mark since I am able to use my computer and read fairly normal sized print with that eye.But tonight, I went outside to see how my eyes would react to lights and I am seeing huge halos from every light I see. I live on a fairly busy street and it's much worse than before the surgery. I don't have this problem with lights indoors. I thought this wouldn't be an issue with mono-focal lenses. Is this most likely due to the eye healing and the after surgery eye drops that I'm using?"
Cataract,IOl exchange-How long after cataract surgery can an IOL exchange occur?,Can an IOL exchange occur successfully longer than 1 year after it is implanted ?
Cataract,Pink hue and crinkled cellophane in peripheral vision post cataract surgery? Anyone?,Had my second eye done a week ago and have noticed my house suddenly has items I recall as beige or brownish that nowhave a rosy hue. Have checked with my husband who says no they are not. Anyone else experience this and does it go away?I also am seeing some of what looks like shaky wrinkled cellophane in the left corner of my near vision corrected eye. Most annoying but the doc says it will go away. ANYONE else?
Cataract,Pilocarpine Eye Drops (For Dysphotopsias),Has anyone tried 1% pilocarpine eye drops for positive/negative dysphotopsias that can comment on their experience? My doc recommended I try these before going forward with a potential IOL exchange surgery. I've had a ReZoom multifocal IOL implanted for 12+ years now and my problems with dysphotopsias have just gotten worse & worse (I think my IOL might be slightly tilted because I also see ghost images).I'm excited to try the eye drops out but also nervous about them since I don't want to create any new problems
Cataract,asking for “a refund” from original surgeon after exchanges proved correct vision ,"so i've contacted a medical malpractice attorney. and although it sounds like i have a case, the end results may not be beneficial to me. the attorney suggested i send a letter with the results of exchanged surgeries and ask to be refunded.anyone else have experience with not going after a malpractice suit, but getting their money back from original surgeon??"
Cataract,Cataract surgery on second eye Tuesday..what to so?,"I had first eye corrected a week ago for distance. Am finding it amazing but worried about second eye. I am naturally very nearsighted and have enjoyed for years being able to read without glasses, and do most things close. I do not want to give that up. The plan is to give me a near vision lens in my second eye, but the surgeon says I may need glasses for close work. I do not understand why. And I am considering waiting until I must have the second done as I am seeing quite well with no glasses now. Can anyone help me understand why I'd need glasses?"
Cataract,Getting a lens for distance,"So I need cataract surgery and I am wondering how your vision will be at close up or intermediate if you have a lens for distance?I assume, for close up stuff, you can basically see nothing? Everything will be 100% blurry, not even able to make out a word?Can you make out any words on a computer screen at arms length?And for intermediate distance (like greater than arms length) how blurry is your vision?Sorry, just trying to get a gauge of how my vision would be. I assume you would need glasses for close up work, and what about intermediate? Do you have 2 different sets of glasses?"
Cataract,Cataract second surgery ,"i had my cataract surgery on both eyes about two years ago, the natural lenses of my eyes where replaced with artificial ones, i would say both surgeries were a success, however i start having some kind of fog on my right eye, i went to see my doctor and it was suguested that i would need to have the cloudiness on the back side of the lens cleared by lazer surgery, so i went ahead and schedule a surgery in about two weeks, but i am still concerned if that will take care of the problem, any comments from someone who went to the same procedure?"
Cataract,Vision changed 1 week after surgery,Right after cataract surgery on my left eye I was amazed at how well I could see! I had worn glasses since I was 9 years old and now I could see without glasses. Exactly 1 week after surgery I was watching TV and my left eye went blurry. The next morning I called my surgeons office. I was told to come right in to be examined. After the exam the surgeon told me he had used a lens that would make me near sighted so he had been surprised at how good I could see right after surgery. He told me that the blurriness I was now experiencing was due to the lens settling into the correct location. That nothing was wrong and that the right eye that I had just had done would do the same. I have never heard of this. Do lenses settle?

Cataract,"Upcoming cataract surgery - wondering which lens to get for ""best"" near vision?","My story - cataract in right eye, developed last summer, somewhat corrected by glasses, but barely. Trouble seeing at night. Very blurry close up until about 5-6 inches. And it's getting worse, so I'm ready for the surgery. Also a high degree of astigmatism in the right eye (but not the left), so I'm getting the Toric IOL.My left eye is -2.5. I was originally thinking of going for a 0 in the right eye - wouldn't that be nice, to be able to see distances without my glasses? But I was told the difference in diopters is too great, and I'd have to wear a contact lens in my left eye (at least until that one needs the surgery as well, which could be anywhere from 6 months to 10 years). And that sounds horrible.Then I realized that what I REALLY want is what I've been used to my whole life - perfect near vision. I like to read (a lot!), and I'm also a (semi-retired) software developer, so I spend lots of time in front of the computer, on the phone, etc. Until I was about 40, I had perfect near vision to about 2-3 feet - so I never used my glasses for either reading or the computer. In a perfect world, I'd be able to regain that ability after the surgery.My left eye (which is dominant) still sees perfectly well at about 12 inches, so I can ""sort of"" read, but it's not very pleasant - even with the reading glasses I got a few months ago to correct the right eye.I was originally told my choices were ""distance, intermediate, or near"" - meaning 0, -1 or -2. I was leaning towards getting -2, because even with a -1, there would still be a 1.5 diopter difference between left and right, and I understand that's pushing the limits - although apparently my all-around vision will be better by getting rid of the astigmatism. I guess the doctor doesn't want to confuse people, but after a little research, I asked about numbers in between those, and she said, ""Sure, we also offer a -1.6.""So what I'm wondering about is, what would be the difference between a -2 and a -1.6 toric IOL in my right eye, with the left eye at -2.5? Would I be able to both read at ""normal"" book length (12 inches or so), and read the computer screen (24-36 inches) without glasses? That would be my dream... Or, if I go for the -2, would I still need computer glasses (or progressives), as I've been using the last 15 years? (And which I hate...). Above all, I REALLY don't want to have to wear any glasses when I'm reading. My entire life, I've enjoyed taking off my glasses and getting in bed with a book...As they said in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, ""I'm soooo confused!"" Any thoughts or ideas are appreciated! Surgery is scheduled for April 17, so I have about 5 days to figure this out!"

Cataract,Extreme Astigmatism after sclera implanted IOL,"Dear all,I had 3 and a half weeks ago a luxation of my IOL on my right eye and a couple of days later surgery.The toric lens was explanted trough a large clear cornea incision /7...8mm), as reverse optic capture wasn´t possible due to severe zonular laxity and teared capsule. A standard 3 piece IOL was fixatedto the sclera.Since the surgery a have an extreme astigmatism and large ghostings. Astigmatism is almost twice as pre - operative. (6,5 dpt instead previously 3 dpt)The clear cornea incision of 7..8 mm was placed at the steeper meridian at aprox. 40°) and was not sutured. Here the keratometer values: PRE-OP R1 = 8,56 / 133° /// R2 = 8,00/ 30° (ca. -2,95 dpt) Now:R1 = 8,78 / 115° /// R2 = 7,60 / 20° (ca. 6,4 dpt)My surgeon was surprised and has no idea where that extreme reaction of the cornea comes from, especially as the cornea should have been flattening insteadof becoming steeper. His explanation was that a mild edema at the wound is the culprit, but the edema now is gone and the cornea still shows the same values withno improvement.Does somebody have an idea where this drastic change comes from? Will that corneal change or regress to at least pre- op values or am I now at risk to have this condition permanently?Which options of treatment are there for such a case as mine? I hope that anybody can help me.Thank you !"

Cataract,Cataract surgery or stronger prescription?,"Hello everybody,I have scheduled my right eye cataract surgery, which is supposed to happen in about 2 weeks, but I am still having second thoughts, about possibly waiting some more.I'd like to know whether a a stronger prescription can temporarily take care of cataract problems. My glasses prescriptions are -3.25 L and -4.0 R. Left eye has no cataract. Overall, my vision is not too bad at all, because my left eye carries most of the load. But if I cover it and look at the TV, for example, I can hardly read any text on the screen.I haven't seen an optometrist, so now I'm questioning if my right eye prescription is correct. I have been seeing an ophthalmologist for the last 2 or 3 years, but, other than checking the development of the cataract, they never check the prescription.So I experimented a bit, using some of my old glasses and may have found something interesting...or not, I don't know.I've printed a copy of Snellen Eye Chart and placed it on the wall, and stood about 10 feet away. My left (no cataract) eye is perfect, as I can read everything on the chart with any problems (with glasses, of course). The right (cataract) eye, as expected, is a completely different story. I can't read even the biggest font. However, when I use my old glasses, and places them on top of the ones I'm wearing, I can read the top 4 lines, maybe even the 5th. By placing old lens on top of the existing, I am probably changing my -4.0 to something close to -7.0 (not quite sure what the old prescription was).Does any of this make any sense? Could I possibly postpone the surgery by getting stronger prescription on my right eye? Even if I can, would I maybe run into a completely different problem, where the difference in prescriptions between my eyes would be almost 4 diopters, whereas now it is only 0.75?I'd really appreciate any feedback, especially if anybody had successfully ""cheated"" on their cataract by stronger prescription. Of course, ""cheating"" would be only temporary, until my left eye develops a cataract as well (might take a few years, nobody knows), and then I do them both.Thanks!"
Cataract,need feedback re: cataract surgery & correcting for near vs far vision,"I'm facing cataract surgery & am wondering if anybody can help, particularly if you were myopic (nearsighted) prior to surgery & chose to remain slightly myopic afterwards? I am approx -4 in both eyes with approx. +1 astigmatism in both. I've worn glasses since early childhood, so I'm used to seeing things clearly without glasses (being able to read, remove a foreign object from my eye, apply mascara, etc) , as long as those things are within about 1-foot of my eyes. It seems that the majority of cataract patients get corrected for far vision, in which case they no longer see things that are up close clearly without glasses (the exact opposite of what I am used to). Since I'm not interested in ""multi-focasl"" (apparently not as crisp vision as ""standard"" lenses), & also probably not interested in setting 1 eye for distance & 1 for near (I'd probably stay dizzy all the time), I'm wondering how those in my situation have delt with suddenly not having clear close vision (such as if you needed to remove a foreign object from your eye) if both eyes are set for distance vision? Also, I've read reports of people who have gone that route saying they end up having to get reading glasses in several different strengths, since different ""near"" tasks are performed at different distances...for instance 1 pair/strength for reading a book, a different pair/strength for knitting, ditto for working at the computer, & so on. Although being able to drive without glasses is very appealing, I'm not sure I want to deal with all of the issues that it sounds like I would be faced with by having both eyes set for distance. Can anybody who has gone from being nearsighted to being corrected in both eyes for distance comment on the issues I've raised (particularly if your nearsightedness was around -4 or worse)? Are these valid concerns? SO, due to those concerns, I'm currently considering staying slightly myopic (nearsighted) in both eyes...anybody out there have this esperience??? My concerns about this choice include not knowing at what distance from my face I would be able to see clearly without glasses...will I be able to see my computer screen clearly enough to not get horrible headaches due to the ""fuzziness""? Will I only be able to see about 1-ft from my face clearly (like now)? I spend a LOT of time reading books & also on my computer (so it terrifies me to think of losing my near vision if both eyes are set for distance!)...it would be REALLY nice to be able to see well enough to perform tasks from the distance of my computer screen in...is this even possible??? Right now, the WORST distance for me is the computer screen...it's not clear AT ALL without my glasses or with them (I have progressive bifocals & can't find ANY spot where the computer screen is in good focus). I really hope somebody out there has been in the same boat as me & can provide some insight! I am particularly interested in hearing from anybody who was in my situation & chose to stay slightly myopic, but any comments/points are welcome! Thanks in advance! "

Cataract,New Glasses,"I had a botched cataract surgery a few years ago on my left eye. This resulted in another surgery to remove the remnants, two RD's, and finally corrective surgery. The original iol was the wrong type and inserted crooked. In the fifth surgery by another doctor the correct iol was used and re-inserted correctly. However the results were not good. I had only degraded vision. I delayed surgery on my right eye as long as I could and finally decided to do the surgery on my right eye about three months ago. That surgery went well. My surgeon used an iol that gave me good near vision and it does. The doctor said he thought this would be best considering the condition of my left eye. I could see great up to about three feet and then everything would blur. After two months the doctor said I could get glasses. The prescription was -4.00 for both eyes. I got my glasses about two weeks ago and could see very good with them. I knew I would need to allow an adjustment period but everything seemed great the first week. In the second week I started getting nasty headaches especially over my left eye. I would wake up feeling good and energetic and about three hours later was exhausted and had to lay down. These symptoms progressed and were getting worse through the week.Yesterday I took the glasses off and felt somewhat better but that left me with my limited vision. Amazingly my vision seems better than before the glasses. Today I woke, felt good, went grocery shopping, and on the way home decided to retry my new glasses. Within minutes I felt off balance, like my eye was pulling to the side, and nauseous. I removed the glasses and slowly I am feeling better. Tomorrow I will call my eye surgeon. Yesterday I took my glasses to where I had them made and they checked the glasses and told me they were as my prescription called for.The only explanation I can think of is my eyes were not finished adjusting and now I may need a different prescription. Also, I found my vision is now better, not good, than the day I got the glasses. Commends appreciated, thanks."
Cataract,Post Cataract ghosting/Double vision,"I had cataract surgery 8 weeks ago on rt.eye. only. I was still reading 20/25 with contact lens but had bad glare. I had a toric IOL implantednd am now slightly undercorrected in that eye both power and some astigmatism. I struggle to read 20/25 with much blur so the surgeon sent me to optomotrist for refraction. I am now wearing a -.50 contact lens in my surgery eye which gets me 20/20 vision. My left eye has a cataract but with a -4.50 toric lens I am still reading 20/20. So, no plans to have surgery on that eye right now. I can no longer wear glasses at all due to imbalance between eyes. So, I am in my contacts many hrs. each day. my vision with both eyes open seems a bit off...like my eyes are not working together. In low light I sometimes see ghosting or double vision only on high contrast items like lit store signs, LED light on alarm clock, crawl on television. This is with both eyes open. sometimes if I use artificial tears I can get the images to meld. The closer I get to the high contast writing the better. My near vision with readers is clear and not ghosted. Other objects in the room are not ghosted...just the lit writing. I feel like the image in my right eye is slightly larger than the image in my left eye and this might be causing the ghosting? I am thinking I will have this issue until my left cataract is removed or unless neuroadaptation by my brain occurs. Has this happened to others after having only one IOL implanted? Is there any solution?Also, i have worn contacts for 49 years. My surgeon did not have me remove my contacts for weeks or even days prior to mapping that is done before surgey. Wondering why and if this is why my IOL is not accurate."
Cataract,Iol Movement.,"Had cataract surgery Mar 20 on right eye. It seems I can see it shifting into place when I look left, right or up and down., almost like a contact lens. Could this be the cause of incorrect measurements as I was not told how long to stop wearing contacts before the measurements until I called 2 days before to ask. I also have macular degeneration and glaucoma. Very scared to have the second one done Apr. 17."
Cataract,What’s up with my eyes after cataract surgery,"i have had cataract surgery on both of my eyes within the last few weeks ( eyes done 2 weeks apart). MY left eye, dominant eye was corrected for distance. i was amazed at how crystal clear everything seemed. Two weeks later, last week, my right eye was done for near vision, reading. i am so upset. i cant read, blurred vision. i cannot see distance clearly. i spoke to my doctor and he told me that it takes time for the brain to coordinate and that i would be able to see without my glasses and read. That does not seem to be happening. i need to add that i am extremely nearsighted, 70 years old and have worn glasses for my entire life. My doctor recommended using lasers for accuracy ( which cost $1000 per eye, out of pocket).I see him next week and hope i can get new glasses prescribed to help me read and see distance. this has been an extremely depressing experience."
Cataract,"I had cataract surgery 9 weeks ago and the letters merge, blur and tilt and disappear!","I had cataract surgery 9 weeks ago and not only do I still see somewhat blurry, but I see shadows when I turn and when I read the letters seem to almost dance. They tilt to the left and merge with the next one and then tilt to the right and merge, sometimes the merge into the next one or change in form. Sentences curve to the right or sometimes curve up and down forming peaks. My doctor placed toric lenses for astigmatism and says that it happens because I have wet macula, then the test showed no leaks so now he says I have damage to my retina. I had the same procedure done on the other eye and I am fine after 2 weeks. He was dismissive saying your eyes will deteriorate don't you know? I said yes but my macular doctor just treated my eyes a week ago and he has taken care of my eyes with no problem. I am so frazzled, please help...."
Cataract,Complications after cataract surgery/YAG laser,"I am 50 years old and had my cataract surgery one year ago (toric lenses were put in), since then I have been through some horrible stuff. I had Macular Edema in both eyes a short while after my cataract surgeries, but this seems to have cleared up according to my retinal scans and multiple examinations. Once my Macular Edema cleared up in both eyes I had the YAG laser to clear up my posterior capsular opacification. The next morning after my YAG laser, I woke up and I knew something was terrible wrong, In dim light (even indoors with fluorescent lighting), I could see a fuzzy halo around lights and starbursts too. At night time when I am driving, every light ranging from headlights to traffic lights….any light at night, I can see long stretched out spiky starbursts. The brighter the light (like those super bright headlights you see in newer cars), the longer and stretchy the starburst will be. Every once in a while the starburst will also have a rainbow effect to it that is inside the starburst itself. Note: I am seeing the starbursts with or without my glasses, so it wouldn't be residual astigmatism like my doctor thought it might be. I am also seeing bright oddly shaped circle lights every morning right now like when I had my macular edema, when I went to my doctor he did another retinal scan of my eyes but it showed no macular edema. My vitreous gel seems to be a mess also, I can live with floaters, but now it seems like the vitreous gel is clumping together or something, and when I look to the left and right or up and down I see like something hazy and sweeping going the opposite way that I am looking. I asked if my lenses got pitted or damaged or something during my YAG laser treatment but my doctor said no. My doctor had some ""copy and paste"" explanation for everything (like basically well…just live with it), so I went to see a second doctor (at my HMO hospital), and after her examination she basically said the same thing ""well you're seeing 20/20 with glasses"" along with her ""copy and paste"" explanations as well. Not happy with her responses, I asked politely to be referred to the retinal surgeon…she didn't like it that much, and after that her demeanor changed for the worse. So moving forward…I've been researching Dr. Google (doctors hate when I do this, lol), I was thinking that maybe they should widen the YAG treatment area more (maybe it will clear up the starbursts cause I have large pupils), and maybe I should get a vitrectomy (for my clumpy vitreous gel or whatever else it might be that is possibly pulling at my retina causing the circles of light in the morning right when I wake)? I see the retinal surgeon later this month, is there any suggestions you guys might give me that I might bring to the table when I see him? I feel like I am going blind or something. Thank you."
Cataract,"Probable Exchange, Considering Symfony","In my last post, I mentioned that I was left with some refractive error and had to make some decisions about what to do.So, here's the update. I went for a second opinion about my situation with a very experienced doctor. I'm not going to write every detail about the evaluation for the sake of time, but here's the important stuff:The doctor says I was given a 13.5 when he would have given be me a 15. He also says the astigmatism power of my current IOL is weak. He has no idea why my measurements with the original doctor were off. I am in the process of trying to get more info from that doctor.He says I have three options. He does not think Lasik/corneal surgery is the best option. He thinks I should either wear a contact lens to correct the error OR exchange the IOL for the correct monofocal IOL OR exchange for the Symfony if I would like better intermediate vision.He is not pushing me in any direction, but I think he has concerns that the contact lens is not a long-term solution because I only had surgery in one eye -- my original plan was to have a Monofocal lens in my RE and continue to wear a contact in the LE for the time being (possibly having that vision surgically corrected down the line). Also, I am young. I can wear a contact lens now, but what if down the line my eyes are dry and it becomes difficult. I cannot wear glasses with the IOL in only one eye and the other eye being myopic.He seems to think an IOL exchange is the better long-term choice. We talked about continuing with the Monofocal vs changing to the Symfony.Okay, so that brings me to my real question:I'm young. 33. I am not presbyopic in my LE and I am concerned that continuing with the Monofocal route will be hard given my work with computers. I might find the sweet spot for intermediate vision by making my RE more myopic, but would the Symfony be a better choice for my situation? I understand the drawbacks. I am looking for input from Symfony users, especially people who have one in one eye only. Do you find this works well? Are you generally happy with your intermediate vision?I also would like to hear from unilateral IOL people with Monofocal lenses. Were you able to get by with readers for computer use with one eye able to see near/intermediate better than the other?I am facing a trade-off either way. I think I would prefer to have night vision issues and be able to do computers more easily, but I don't know for certain. I need to make my decision over the next few weeks, during the window for easier exchange surgery. I am awaiting a contact lens for my RE to correct the error and that will tell me more. In the meantime, I'm just looking for input. Thank you."
Cataract,how close can i expect to see,"Hi. I had a toric distance IOL put in one eye a few weeks ago, but there was a refractive surprise. It looks like I'm a bit farsighted and having residual astigmatism. I have pushed back doing the other eye while this one heals.Anyway, I was told to get a contact lens to correct the error until we decide if a second surgery would be better.So here's my question. With the contact, meaning the refractive error will be corrected, how close will I be able to see? With the error, I am currently blurry at all distances. I am not eager to have surgery until I know exactly how much I want to fix the refraction, which is while I am going to try contacts at a few powers. (ie, 1. Set at plano; 2. -0.50; 3. -1.00) That sort of test run, if you follow.My doc says I should clearly well from about a meter out set at plano. Is that correct?I am trying to confirm this online, but I see a lot of different opinions on what to expect of a distance IOL. Sometimes I see claims of blurry until 15 ft, sometimes I see claims of seeing well much much closer, like 3 feet. Both my inlaws with distance IOLs see well up to a arms length.I have a Tencis, btw. Monofocal. Toric."
Cataract,Still have glare and shadowy floaters after 2 years from surgery ,been on here several l times in last year and half. will my eyes ever clear up normal. still seeing wavy glare and shadows if black floaters
Cataract,IOL flickering: a simple solution,"Hi all, for people with persistent eye-movement-related light flickering after cataract surgery, even months or years later, there is something worth trying: dilating eye drops. The flickering after pupil dilation miraculously stops.This happens because the capsule complex wobbles inside the eye, catching the light (probably more on the edges, with side lighting, but also on the plate, with frontal lighting) and making the light flickering. There are several videos proving that disturbance (check on youtube ""ewa ingram flickering""). According to several doctors, it happens when patient's ciliary muscles are still active (usually in young people), they contract making the capsule and lens to wobble because of loose zonular system. Using dilating eye drops, it paralyzes the ciliary muscles, fixing the iol wobbling."
Cataract,"Good, not Great -- 5 Months After Cataract Surgery","My wife, age 60, had cataract surgery in both eyes five months ago. Both of her lenses were quite cloudy. She also had substantial astigmatism in both eyes.Five months later, her vision is clear and bright, but she still requires corrective lenses for BOTH distance vision and for reading. Without glasses her vision is sharp only between about 3 and 10 feet. Her doctor said the goal was for good distance vision without glasses, but that has not happened. Thus, she must still wear eyeglasses most of the time, except at her computer.Overall, her vision is much improved. She previously required heavy, thick eyeglass lenses. Now her glasses are light and comfortable. This is a welcome change.However, she expected not to need glasses for distance vision. At this stage -- five months removed from her cataract surgery -- is her distance vision likely to further improve? Or is this as good as it's going to get?Thanks,Jeff"
Cataract,Bits of Cataract Remaining After Surgery,"HI ALLi had cataract surgery on my right eye about two weeks ago i see much clearer (20/15 vision now) but i was seeing a ton of specs in my vision on mu followup the next day my doctor told me there was a small tear that happened during surgery (i think he said on the retina but bot certain) that allowed some remnants to get into the eye fluid and it should dissolve in a few weeks to months. i returned yesterday for a follow up and he said the same thing . Theres been no improvementThis is a drawing i made approximating what i see. A few large remnants and dozens if not hundreds of small grains mostly in the upper field of visionI'm not sure of his explanation and plan of (non) action for a few reasons i believe that the specs I'm seeing are on a fixed surface of my eye for two reasons first, if i stare at a fixed soot and move only my head the spots do not move at all if they were floating in liquid i would expect SOME movement second because they always remain the same location in relation to each other. So that a larger triangle shaped remnant and a smaller straight , stick shaped remnant are always the same distance from each other for the past two weeks id expect them to move over time if they were floaters in liquidEven if they are floaters, I mistrust his plan of letting then dissolve on their own At first I asked how often this happens and he said maybe 1 in 1000 times. But when i asked him how often he sees them going away on their own he couldn't give me an answer He said patients disappear so they don't always check in so he can see the remnants are gone. I asked how he knew they might dissolve away and he said thats what the body does it reabsorbs things like this eventually it sounded like guesswork to mehe seemed more concerned that the tear wouldn't get worse or get infected. And of course I want to be sure that doesn't happen. But my goal is also to have clear vision and it concerns me that he seems so unconcerned and I feel like i've merely traded in one eye condition for anothersorry for the lengthy explanation but any insight (pun intended) would be appreciated"
Cataract,Concerns about Alcon Acrysoft IOL,"I am scheduled for my first cataract eye surgery on March 5. I have selected to do a toric monofocal lens set for distance with mini monovision. I was told the lens my surgeon uses is the Alcon Acrysoft. I have read comments that this lens causes glimmering and, also, a diamond shaped reflection (cat-eye) that can be seen by, and is disturbing, to others. I would like to avoid the glimmering and, even though it is cosmetic, I don't want to feel self-conscious about the appearance of my eyes and want to avoid the ""cat-eye"" reflection, too. Can anyone who has had this lens implanted share with me your experience with these two issues? I'm hoping my concerns are unfounded but right now I am filled with anxiety and indecision about my upcoming surgery."
Cataract,Does it matter which lens goes in the dominant eye?,My left eye is going to need cataract surgery and then the right eye maybe another year from now. The left eye is non-dominant and near sighted and right is dominant and far sighted. The doctor said we can put a multi-focal or mono-focal lens in the non-dominant left. I am leaning toward the multi-focal lens and then later replace the right eye with a multi-focal or mono-focal lens depending on what I want.But from what I've been reading is that it is better to put the distance lens on the dominant eye. If i put a multi-focal lens in the non-dominant eye and then later put a mono-focal lens set for near or medium vision for reading will my brain have a hard time especially since that's the opposite of how I see right now. I know if I go with two multi-focal lenses it won't be an issue. But if I do go with a modified mono-vision set up would it be better to replace the left non-dominant near sight eye with the mono-vision lens for reading and then later on get the multi-focal lens in the dominant right eye for distance and driving?
Cataract,Post-op tips - Night-time Driving Glare Solutions,"Hi all:)Thought I would start a thread for tips & solutions people have found after cataract surgery. Maybe others will add their own tips.:)I found two solutions for night-time driving glare:Here's the Amazon title ""Car Windshield Tac Sun Visor Night Anti-Glare - Zone Tech Premium Quality Universal Sunshade and Night Vision Anti-Dazzle Windshield Driving Visor"". It cost $15 and was delivered free within 2 days.Don't try the similar product advertised on TV as the ""Battle Visor"". They're a scam company, unfortunately. Never delivered product & I had to call my cr cd company to get the charge removed.2)I add some pale turquoise sunglasses for the 2-lane road to my house, populated with lots of new cars with bright bluish-white LED headlights.Between the two, I have little problem with glare anymore.:)"
Cataract,My distance vision is terrible after surgery,"I had a monofocal lens for distance placed in January. The doctor said she aimed it to be -.o1 . It is measuring -1.0. I can see up to about 20 feet away. After that it becomes blurry, almost to the point of double vision when looking at things like road signs. The only thing the doctor is recommending is that I wear glasses. I am extremely upset because I didn't need glasses before and I don't feel like I should have to settle on wearing glasses after surgery. Also, it is as if I am looking through the opening of a glass jar. I can see a ring that makes my depth perception seem off. At night, there is a complete tunnel of rings that surround any points of light. I am overall displeased with the outcome of surgery. I have not had my other eye done because I am afraid that the same thing will happen to it. I did go to another surgeon for a second opinion but all he did was look at the lens and said it looked beautiful. He didn't want to hear my concerns. I am just really frustrated."
Cataract,Epiretinal membrane,"Hi, I'm having laser surgery on my right eye next Tuesday. Have been told I have Epiretinal membrane and I opted for laser first to see if it would help, although was told it probably wouldn't, I'm really worried that I may have to have surgery, has anyone else had this and had the surgery, what was it like and am I worrying for nothing...I had cataract surgery in both eyes in 2017"
Cataract,Cataract Surgery with cold?,I'm supposed to have cataract surgery tomorrow morning (3/5) and just realized today that I am coming down with a cold. Can I still have my surgery or will it need to be rescheduled?

Cataract,Severe Fatigue After Cataract Surgery,"I had cataract surgery about two weeks ago. All went went and my vision was excellent close by but distance vision was and is blurred. My doctor said it would take about a month to settle and if my distance did not improve I would probably need glasses for correction. Since my surgery I have been very tired. If I attempt to exert myself I feel like I am so exhausted I cannot complete the task. The first week I was on three eye drops four times a day. This week I am on two eye drops, dexamethasone and ketorolac, twice daily.Anyone else have a similar experience? I have found a few posts like this but most of the fatigue subsided after about a week. I also want to point out that my distance vision is blurred and I thought that strain may be contributing to my fatigue. Comments appreciated, thanks."
Cataract,Flickering iol=solution,"Hello,this question have been posted several times but there is a turning point. In young patients the zonules (strings that keep the bag steady) are still very elastic and they can move making the bag and the iol inside the bag wobbling. That's why you perceive the flickering effect. Check on youtube ""Alcon AcrySof IQ PanOptix IOL - Eye lens flickering after cataract surgery"", there is a video about a woman with very obvious lens wobbling called pseudophacodonesis. Try to film your eyes and see if you can perceive this effect too. I did!"
Cataract,Any of you have a Monofocal and Symfony IOL on one eye each?,"Do any of you have a monofocal IOL and a symfony IOL each on one eye?Are you able to see a big difference between the two? like when you close one eye or the otherDo they both work will together binocularly? Does it cancel each other's weaknesses and bring out each of their strengths?Did you wish you could have just gone with one type of IOL for both eyes? Which of the two would you rather have? "
Cataract,Steroids as a cause of cataracts,"In an article in today's Daily Mail Dr Martin Scurr writes about his experience of laser surgery to cure his short sight. In a separate comment he said :Furthermore, by 2014, I had developed cataracts as a result of steroids (for a lung complaint) and needed yet more surgery."
Cataract,Posterior Polar Cataracts,"Hi guys,I posted previously about needing two doctors for my cataract surgery and apparently that's still the case, but I thought I should start a different thread about the exact type of cataracts I have.I was diagnosed with bilateral posterior polar cataracts with a 99% chance of rupture or a hole developing during this surgery and consequently needing a second operation from a retinal specialist. Needless to say I'm a little concerned.Apparently these types of cataracts are very rare if not the rarest form of cataracts there are with a high chance of complications during surgery.Has anyone had any experience with this type of cataract and what were the results from any surgery?I'm trying to find out the success rate with this type of surgery but googling only comes up with how complex the surgery is and doesn't really say how successful this surgery is.If this post should be with the other thread I started, please feel free to move it there.Thank you,John"
Cataract,Clouding after cataract surgery,"I went to my appointment yesterday to see if I needed Laser surgery as I've got clouding in my right eye, the surgeon said Laser may not help as I have a problem with the membrane behind my eye and recommended surgery. (I had cataract surgery in March 2017) he gave me 2 choices. Surgery or Laser...I opted to try Laser first. Has anyone had the surgery, if so, what was it like, am rather worried as surgeon said recovery from surgery is usually about a month but if there are any complications it could be 6 months..I'm in the UK...."
Cataract,My Symfony experience ,"I opted for the Symfony lens for both eyes nearly two years ago.First, I have to say that I miss my real lenses.I find these lenses very unnatural, and I’m not sure that I will ever adapt to them.For some reason, the vision is unstable. I’m not sure if the problem is with some sort of variation in my cornea, but sometimes the vision will be quite clear and other times, somewhat distorted.Also, after doing close work for a bit, things far away will be out of focus.My guess is that while I’m doing close work, the muscles that used to change the focus are still trying to make the lenses focus. Just a guess. I can’t figure out what else would explain it.Another thing is that when I’m in a brightly lit environment, the vision is very flashy and sort of jumpy. It can be unnerving.There is sort of a visual jumpiness in a lot of situations. Again, I find this unnatural.To be fair, my left eye has astigmatism from Lasik that was performed 20 years ago, making things worse.The astigmatism makes things “less than clear” through my whole range of vision in that eye, which is frustrating.I don’t know if a Toric lens could have fixed that.I’ve heard that the Cornea and flap might be able to be “touched up” to fix that problem, but not sure that I want to risk it.Adding to my troubles are the fair amount of floaters that I have.I’m not sure what other possibilities might have made my outcome more favorable.I have always had excellent near vision, which I sorely miss.I sometimes wonder if opting for something that would have preserved that might have been the best plan.I think that the echelette design of the Symfony lens gives certain advantages, but it also creates some problems.Enjoy your real eyes while you have them.One other thing. . .I have a friend who had her cataracts done twenty years ago, and she can see close and far. She doesn’t have any idea what IOLs they used or what enhancement might have been done.Crazy."
Cataract,Considering multifocal IOL exchange 12 years out & post YAG,"Hi everyone,I'm considering IOL exchange in my LE 12 years after the original implant (I have a ReZoom multifocal IOL) & also had YAG laser 6 years ago. I've been dealing with halos/dysphotopsias since the beginning and started noticing fog around text & diplopia symptopms after the YAG. I'm a self described perfectionist and probably should never have selected a multifocal IOL but I was only 17 yrs old at the time and didn't do any research beforehand...The reason I've been able to get by all these years is because my RE is natural & can filter out the LE disturbances. I recently discovered I have a developing cataract in my RE and the vision is getting dimmer (so my theory is that the RE now has trouble filtering out the LE problems). Below is a short timeline that covers my eye history:2007- original cataract surgery with ReZoom mIOL set for intermediate. Noticed halos & waxy vision from day one but it was tolerable (however I was never amazed with my vision - it was just OK).2013- YAG treatment and vitrectomy in the same month. These surgeries cleared up some haziness I had prio but now I see fog around words & diplopia is more noticeable and disturbing.2019- visited Dr. Steve Safran in New Jersey and he said he could exchange for 3 piece monofocal IOL with 2% chance of ""something going wrong"". He does IOL exchanges all the time so I trust he would be the best for my situation.All in all, I can't decide if I should move forward with the exchange for a monofocal (the recommendation is to use a Softport AO aspheric lens). I currently refract to 20/15 in both eyes which is amazing so I would hate to attempt this surgery & somehow end up worse than I am now. At the same time I don't want to live the rest of my life dealing with these symptoms so I can't decide if it's really worth trying.Any opinions are greatly appreciated since I'm starting to feel afraid of the future. I'm only 29 years old with hopefully 50+ years left to live so this decision isn't easy knowing the long term consequences it will have on my lifeThank you all for your support,Grant"
Cataract,Cataract Surgery now I am told I have Posterior Vitreous Detachment ,I have had cataract surgery in both my eyes . 2 months ago I had a Zeiss Lisa in my left eye and 2 weeks later Zeiss Lara. I do have the halos with the multi focal but do like that I can see close up . For reading and close up I will be using +1 . My problem is I kept having a film or jelly cross my vision on my left eye which is very distracting. My Dr. kept telling me I was just adapting to the lenses well went for my check up the other day and when she checked my eye she said she could see what I was talking about and it was PVD and it could be a more serious operation if I can't stand it with a specialist. I asked her why I didn't notice it before and she said the symptoms of my cataracts covered it. Could the surgery cause this. Thanks
Cataract,Laser surgery,"I had cataract surgery on my right eye in March 2017 and since then my eye hasn't felt right. Told the surgeon when I went for my check up and my optician, they said it was dry eye and to use drops, but it has steadily got worse as I now have a floater some clouding and what looks like a hair in front of my eye...went for an eye test in November and was told I may need Laser surgery. I have an appointment at the hospital on the 14th February. Am a little concerned, has any one on here had the laser surgery and if so what was it like. Thanks"
Cataract,Collamer intraocular lens,"Hello! Unfortunately after 6 months of really disturbing glare, halos, flickering and so on with an Acrysof, an acrylic hydro-phobic intraocular lens implanted in my right eye, I asked to have a lens exchange. I made some research and found several studies suggesting a lens called NANOFLEX made of collamer, a special polymer which has a very high water content, a very low or nonexistent degree of glare and halos, it is totally bio-compatible, it doesn't attract proteins, zero glistering, zero reflects, it has a dense core which mimics the human crystalline ... it even has some accommodating function so people with that lens can see relatively well both close and far. I asked my surgeon and he criticized that lens telling that ""it's an old model"" ... what?! Who cares? The lens he put me and he had magnificent it, it's brand new and yet it's causing a lot of problems to many people (even on this forum there are several complying bitterly about that). So he has a sort of prejudice against the nanoflex and said he won't use it on me. Now I'm really wondering why is that ... What could be wrong with that lens? Did I miss something?Hello!

Cataract,Any advice as I prepare for cataract surgery?,"After having a successful emergency vitrectomy performed over nine months ago, I'm now scheduled for cataract surgery to remove the one that has grown/formed in that eye. The plan is to have a near distance lens inserted and get a new eyeglass prescription (progressives) 6-8 weeks afterward. Anyway... I'm nervous. Any advice for how to prepare for the surgery? Any advice for the recovery period? How did your procedure go? Thanks in advance for any tips and/or personal experiences you can share!"

Cataract,dry eyelids after surgery,"I'm wondering if anyone suffers from dry skin on the eyelids after cataract surgery. I had my surgery in October 2018 , both eyes within a week of each other. No problems except about 3 weeks ago I noticed the bridge of my nose and one spot on both eyelids got flaky and very slightly red and I still have it. Depending on lighting, I sometimes can't see it at all, but at other times I do.I'm 65 so it could be dry skin as I age, but just wondering if surgery had any input. I did have sticky eye on my eyelids the first day after surgery but that was it. I don't suffer from dry EYES at all, just the eyelids and bridge of nose."

I did have yag laser done so is it still possible? Any advice would be greatly apprecited.
Cataract,Prescription changes 15 months after cataract surgery,Had an appointment today with the optometrist who diagnosed my cataracts. Saw her 3 months post op to get my prescription. At the time both eyes were plano for distance and i had slight astigmatism in both eyes (RE .25 & LE .50). Although I haven't used readers much I was given a prescription of 1.75.I had EDOF IOLs (Symfony implanted summer of 2017).Today from my visit glad to receive the news there is no sign of pco but my prescription changed. For the better in RE see 15/20 in RE and now no astigmatism. LE needs a bit of help at .25 for distance and astigmatism increased to .75Reading prescription decreased to 1.25 although only time I used them this year was for extended reading or very tiny print.I was surprised to find out my vision could still keep changing in next few years. Wondering if this is the nature of cataract surgery and IOLs or because I was diagnosed at 53 with cataracts vs the normal age for cataracts. Forgot to inquire with my optometrist.Anyways wondering if difference between eyes will cause some headaches and RE will be working overtime. It may be helpful if I got glasses to use when driving to reduce the strain.Anyone else still on the forums a year or more out from surgery experiencing fluctuations in vision?
Cataract,Flickering side-light after cataract surgery. Causes?,"Hello everyone,I wrote before on this portal and have seen other people complaining about this symptom, side-light flickering, so am going to write again.SymptomsIt's always a side flickering, never frontal, and usually at a specific angle. It's caused by strong or relatively strong light coming from the periphery into the eye, usually from the outer side (like a window during a sunny day) or the upper side (ceiling reflectors). Stronger is the light from the side, stronger the strobe-effect inside the eye. If the light is softer, it's perceived like a little flickering of the light source. It doesn't depend on the pupil aperture: it appears with strong light and relatively small pupil too (a sunny day, in the shops). Many times it's enough to wear sunglasses to let less light inside the eye and stop the debilitating phenomena, so the light must be still relatively enough strong to cause this flickering.The causePeople say it's the lens' squared, truncated (not rounded) edges that reflect the light inside the eye like a reflector. The flickering is strictly correlated to the tiny movements of the eye (called saccades). During the night, especially in younger patients, if the pupil is wide open and some light comes from the periphery, one can notice a flickering half circle (usually called edge-glare). In fact, dilating eye with drops (before an eye exam), it makes the flickering very strong. I can perceive the entire lens reflecting: an entire circle (lens' edges); I can even see the light beam coming from the ceiling reflector right inside my eye.So, making the pupil very small could stop this flickering, since the light does not hit the edge? Oddly enough, pupil constriction drops (alphagan) helps for night light phenomena but it doesn't help much for the flickering. A doctor told me that it's not necessary for the light to hit the edge but it's enough to hit the lens producing edge reflections. So why the light must comes only from the side?Wearing contact lenses, even gas permeable (harder) does not help either, so I don't think it's related to the corneal issues, like astigmatism, corneal transplant, diseases or scars.I have two more options (I don't believe they are the main cause, but worth being mentioned):Since the flickering is always related to eye movements, maybe it could be the wobbling of the iris causing this problem? (it could stop after dilating the pupils but, as I said, it makes the flickering even stronger).I don't perceive any darkness in my periphery but what if this flickering could be a very small negative dypsotopsia? A disco strobe effect is actually a light-dark-light-dark phenomenon."
Cataract,Are there any IOL with rounded-edges on the market?,"In 100% of articles about dyphotopsia, especially positive, say that the main cause of positive dysphotopsia is the new truncated, vertical edges of iol. They prevent capsule opacification but have as result glare, flickering, circles, flares and so. If the capsule opacificies, you can still have a yag laser and have the problem solved, but what about the dysphotopsia that is sometimes permanent and, as read on this site, invalidating for many people?I also see that practically all round-edge iols are now discontinued. Am wondering if there is still some model of rounded-edges available on the market? Is there is a solution for people with intractable glare, even years after the implantation as myself?!"
Cataract,Cataract post surgery,"i had my right eye cataract removed two weeks ago and the doctor told me that my cataract became hard that he had a difficult time pulling it out. I now have a new lens, but i could only see light and shadows. I AM 83 yrs old and really worried i may not regain my sight. Doctor said he will do the laser to improve my sight, i am afraid he damaged something inside my eye but he assured me i will get my normal eyesight after the laser. Can anyone please help me with my concerns and at least give me hope that my doctor is truthful that will see clearly again. Desperate and worried. PLEASE HELP EASE MY WORRIES."
Cataract,Cataract post op question,"Hi! I had monofocal for distance lenses implanted in both eyes. Left eye 2 month ago and the right one - 1 month ago. I can see perfectly with both eyes. Vision is 20/20 in each one. But, when I close my right eye and look at the street sign, letters are blurry, even though it was sharp after surgery. When I look at the computer, it is opposite.Left eye is sharp and right one is blurry. I had both eyes already fully examined and everything looks fine. Could it be that my eyes are still settling? Should I expect the same vision in both eyes? I have slight astigmatism. Could it be the reason for all this?Any response will be appreciated.Thanks.Adele"
Cataract,Surgery done for the only good eye,hi guysmy cataract was removed today in the morning. Things are looking fine so far. power was calculated as -13 by ORA and i went with intermediate vision -1.25D. Here are my observations so farso i may need readers for extended computer work n fine print reading and may be qhile drivingBut i see black floaters/lines all over . Are they normal after surgery ? How long they last in general. ? I undestand it may vary per person but asking in generalalso couple of years ago this eye was treated with laser to prevent retinal detachment. Since i am highly myopic what are the chances of retinal detachment ? I am planning to visit retina specalist next week and also planning for regular visits every 3 months or so ?Please provide your inputs on black floaters and thoughts on RD ?
Cataract,Restor 2.5D Review and Comments,"First, thank you very much to Sue.An and everyone else on this forum for the extremely helpful insight during this very difficult process. I’m going to apologize, in advance, for the length of this post.I’m writing this because I had not found a single review of the newer, Restor 2.5D lenses online, just one or two complaints but the issues didn't seem to be related to the choice of IOL itself. This lens is a lower-add and re-designed (center-distance) version of the older Restor lenses. There are many older Restor posts online but many of these are quite old and, unfortunately, most patients don’t indicate which of the various Restor lenses they had. I had many questions about this lens such as the loss of contrast, nighttime halos, dip in vision between focal points, and similar and other than the company sponsored research and studies there was very little out there. Contrast this with Symfony where there are hundreds of personal reviews and comments. It’s an oddity as there are many, many Restor 2.5D’s being installed. I decided to write my in-depth thoughts and comments on this lens. My left is still unaffected by its cataract, so I think I can do a decent job of comparing the two eyes (which wouldn’t be possible otherwise). Hopefully this will help someone else in the futureBACKGROUNDI am a healthy male (just turned 51). I have cataracts in both eyes which were diagnosed about 2 years ago. There was nothing in my family history (or in my own) which would have put me at risk for early cataracts. At the time, a surgeon told me that it would probably be about 4-5 years before I’d need surgery. That turned out not to be the case although my right eye progressed much more rapidly than my left. I am near sighted and, until recently, have been wearing Acuvue Oasys weekly disposable contacts for ~20 years (-4.5L, -3.25R, although the right was the same as the left before cataracts developed). I have a very mild astigmatism in my right eye (approx 0.25D) which was uncorrected with lenses (and also not corrected during cataract surgery). With the lenses (and before the cataracts progressed), I could see about 20/13 in my left eye and 20/15 in my right eye. At the time of surgery, the vision in my right eye was down to about 20/50 to 20/40 (under perfect lighting conditions) and essentially nothing under other lighting conditions. My left eye is still at 20/13 (so the cataract is not yet an issue in this eye).I have been using +1.25 readers for computers and +2.00 readers for extended cell phone/tablet use for the past 3+ years. My goal was to get back computer, tablet, and some cell phone reading without glasses. I was totally fine with continued use of readers for close-up work and extended cell phone use. I should mention that I am an engineer and electrical contractor and work extensively on the computer. I have a relatively large set-up with a 34” 21:9 and (2) 27” 16:9 monitors (all at 1440P). I sit between 24” and 30” from the monitors which makes text pretty small (and means I need pretty sharp vision). My office is the lowest level of my house, so if I may refer to home and office somewhat interchangeably.One of the biggest problems with presbyopia correcting IOL’s is nighttime halos and other problems. Since the cataract is not yet causing problem in my left eye, I wanted to try to simulate these effects before surgery and I opted to test out some multifocal contact lenses. Ultimately, I was unable to find a lens that could duplicate the nighttime halos of a multifocal IOL. However, after two completely failed attempts, the third multifocal contact I tried (Cooper Proclear 1-Day Multifocal) was a complete success. I was able to achieve 20/13 distance and pretty good intermediate vision. Unfortunately, the cataract in my right eye was too strong and even with this lens in my left eye, I still needed reading glasses. The right eye just caused too much distortion to make extended reading/computer use possible. I tired a patch over the right eye but didn’t adjust to that either.After much research, I chose to go with multifocal Restor 2.5D lenses. I was also considering monofocal IOL’s (set for distance) and Symfony. My surgeon uses both Restor and Symfony although he does 4X as many Restor lenses. Due to my personality, I ruled out any form of monovision. I know that quite a few patients are able to read with monofocal IOL’s set for distance but there are many factors in how well this works. In my case, with contacts set at perfect distance (and some accommodation left), near and intermediate vision are absolutely horrible. I can’t imagine that a monofocal with zero accommodation would suddenly give me great intermediate vision, so I ultimately decided that I would try one of the Presbyopia correcting lenses. Mainly due to this forum, I decided to trade off the extended focus range and lower incidence of nighttime halos with Symfony for the lack of concentric rings (which seem to affect almost everyone). Also, my surgeon’s familiarity with the lenses and the fact that he has not had a single explant ultimately led me to this decision.Although these terms get somewhat interchanged, I’m going to use the term “Halo” to refer to one or more circular/rectangular rings centered around a light source, “Glare” to refer to a more diffuse “blob” of light around an object and “Starburst” to refer to fewer but long, spokes or vertical lines of light radiating away from the central source. When I’m mentioning Halos, I’m talking about artifacts specifically related to the design of the lens while I think most starbursts are artifacts caused by the capsule, scarring or similar and are mostly independent of the choice of IOL.Day 1 (Thursday 2/8/18) – Surgery was at 10:30 AM. Femtolaser room was first, with no sedation, only numbing drops in the eye. I was nervous about this, but it did not hurt and it was over quickly (less than 1 minute). The machine has a suction-like device which helps greatly as you just have to stay “reasonably” still.Once the femtolaser is done, they immediately started IV Sedation and wheeled me to the surgery room. I was pretty much out of it but did get some direction from the surgeon. There was no pain and I was on my way home by noon. My surgeon puts a dressing and shield over the eye for the first night (most surgeons seem to just use a clear shield), so I went home like this and had no idea if I could see at all. There was really no pain, but the bandage over my eye did itch and occasionally I would open my eye below the bandages and it would sting. The gauze itched my eyelid and the sides of my eyes. I would say that dealing with the bandage the first afternoon/evening was far worse than the surgery but it really wasn’t that bad.Day 2 (Friday) – Doctor’s office at 9:30 AM.My bandage was removed and the overall feeling was …underwhelming. I have read many comments on peoples’ first impressions about how everything was so clear and the colors so vibrant and I didn’t feel any of that. The cloudy “veil” was removed but colors looked pretty much the same as before and pretty much exactly like my left eye. This was likely due to the type of cataract I had which was a posterior subcapsular cataract. The surgeon also told me today that I would definitely need YAG within 3 months. He had told me ahead of time that YAG was likely going to be required but now it’s a certainty. I am hoping to see the benefits of the near focal point before we get to that point. At this time, I don’t feel my intermediate vision is good at all. We’ll see how this changes over time, though.Day 2 (Friday) – Back home around 11:30 AM.My vision is not very sharp but it is not horrible either, certainly much better than before the surgery. At distance, I am about 20/50 (I have a chart in my office set at the correct distance). At 6 ft, about 20/70 and at 21 inches (the near focus point for the Restor 2.5D) I am about 20/100 (14-pt font). For near testing, I am using a chart meant to be held at 31cm (which has conversions into metric and feet), but I am holding it close to the 53 cm (21 in) point for the Restor. This means that my actual vision would be a little better than 20/100 (because I am holding the chart further out). Nevertheless, I think it’s a fair measure to see what happens over time and I’ll be doing the same thing as I progress to see if it gets better or worse over time.I tried small distance add glasses (-0.5D and -1.0D) as well as reading glasses (+0.75 and +1.25) and neither of these seemed to make any improvement which I’m hoping is a positive sign that I’m just feeling effects of the surgery itself and not a miss in the target. I am also seeing flashes of light which appear to be emanating from the outside edge of my viewing. They are not constant and the relatively large QTY of floaters I had prior to surgery seems about the same so the surgeon doesn’t believe that I have a retinal detachment.Day 2 (Friday) – Mid-AfternoonI wanted to take the day off, but I had to try to do some work. I got on the computer and forced myself to NOT use my normal +1.25 computer reading glasses. It took about 15-20 minutes but then my vision settled down and seemed to get better and better over the next few hours. I actually worked close to 4 hours without reading glasses for the first time in 2+ years! After this, I went outside to the back yard (it’s been over 70 deg F for the past week here in San Francisco) and lied down by my fire pit with my tablet for more than 2 hours. No reading glasses. I can also use my cell phone now without reading glasses. What I found is that the moderate improvement to my right eye from the new IOL coupled with the multifocal contact in the left eye creates some really impressive combined vision. I am really excited and happy about this.Day 3 (Saturday) – Pretty much exactly 48 hours post-surgeryThis morning, my distance vision has improved to 20/30 and my near (using the same procedure as yesterday) is up to 20/50 (8-pt font). With both eyes together, it is 20/13 distance and 20/25 near (4-pt font). However, I am noticing significant flickering at the right edge of my vision while my eyes are moving (mostly during reading). There is a very good (and long) thread on this forum regarding this symptom. With +2.0 reading glasses I was able to look into the mirror and see the implant itself move and kind of flicker while this happened. I’m hopeful that this condition will lessen as the lens gets held more firmly. Already, I can say that my brain is somewhat tuning them out as I don’t notice them all the time. I also see occasional flashes from an off-angle light source, although this is not frequent.I walked around quite a bit last night and definitely see Halos around most light sources of differing intensity (depending on the light source). I am seeing pretty much exactly what is drawn by David Taylor’s son (Search for, “David Taylor my intraocular lens experience”) in his Restor ere image but WITHOUT the long starburst “spoke” lines (I just see the circles). They are very noticeable but also quite small relative to the size of the light source. The same sources through my left eye appear as slightly smaller and uniform, fuzzy “balls of glare” (probably the only visual evidence of my cataract in that eye). One difference is that with the Restor eye I can make out the actual shape of the light source clearly in the center. For example, a square LED light fixture across the street looks square and more sharp inside 3 or 4larger halo rings (with Restor) where it’s more of a single, diffuse blob with my left eye (and maybe a little smaller overall). Due to my research, this is exactly what I expected to see and while this effect should lessen over time, due to the relatively small size I don’t feel it will cause much of a problem in terms of driving. I may be wrong about this, so we’ll have to try it in a few days.I also tried to see how much of a loss of contrast there is with this lens alternating back and forth between my two eyes. It was pretty hard to see much of a difference. However, in a very dark room I can detect a subtly better image through my left eye. Looking at my bedroom door, for example, I can just make out the hinge and door handle with my left eye but not with my right. I can also see some added detail looking at a power receptacle about 12 feet away whereas I can only see the outline with the Restor eye. It’s really a subtle difference however but I will make note of any differences I see in other situations.I watched a movie and some TV last night in a completely dark room. I wanted to see if I’d notice halos around credits or other objects on the screen. This was a concern of mine as I like to play compute/console games and watch movies. I did not notice any artifacts from the Restor eye, but I will continue to do the left/right eye test on this over the next few weeks.I also wanted to comment on the dropoff in vision that should be there between the two focal points (maybe around the 6 ft, 2m point). At this stage, I cannot notice this, but my vision isn’t sharp enough yet, so I will revisit this late on. This is another area where the Symfony should be superior. Overall Summary and a QuandaryAt this point my visual results (numerically) seem to not be optimal but they are improving and hopefully this will continue. However, my overall vision has improved so much over my pre-surgery condition that I am already very happy at this point while still expecting additional improvement. Had I done an RLE (clear lens exchange), I would probably feel completely different. With my two eyes together (RESTOR 2.5D + Multifocal Contact) my vision is now quite good. I can read my cell in to about 12”(with its default font size) and it’s the Restor providing most of the clarity at this distance. I’ve been able to use a tablet or computer for several hours without glasses. I have regained my depth perception and watching TV just seemed so much more clear and sharp.The problem is that multifocal IOL’s supposedly work much better if implanted bilaterally and I am scheduled to have my left eye surgery in less than 3 weeks. I don’t know if I’m going to go through with it or delay it for a while. The surgery on my right eye was an easy choice – my vision was already poor – but that’s not yet the case with the left. I don’t know if I have another 2-3 months of clear vision or 2-3 years. Also, since I have a multifocal contact paired with a multifocal IOL, does this improve the performance of the IOL (relative to a standard contact lens) or does it mean the Restor side doesn’t improve to its full potential? I haven’t found a single comment or study about this as it’s probably an uncommon situation. I see the surgeon again on Wednesday and I am going to push for a delay on the other eye but I will report back either way. Any comments or suggestions would be appreciated. Finally, in case any contact lens wearers considering an RLE happen upon this post in the future I want to encourage you to exhaust every possible presbyopia curing contact lens option before getting an IOL implant. In my case, the first two multifocal contacts I tried didn’t work at all. I did get good intermediate vision, but my distance vision dropped below 20/40. With one lens, I could get the distance up to 20/20 only if I turned my head sideways and look back at a very sharp angle. On paper, the design of the lens that worked is very similar to the lenses that didn’t worked, but boy did lens #3 work for me. Just find an optometrist that will give you multiple trials of different lenses until you’ve exhausted every option. No matter how good your surgeon replacing doing an RLE will come with some sacrifices. Unfortunately, the contacts will only work for me for a limited time but they feel like magic to me. "
Cataract,Only good eye Surgery this week :(,". Hi GuysHooe you are doing good. I am set for cataract surgery on this month end and i have only one good eye as posted in other topic. I am planning to set vision for intermediate as i work on computer all day.. doc said lets go with -1.5d so may i know how life will be with -1.5d with no other eye.. do i need glasses for TV , driving or to walkingcan i have progressive glasses that covers all ranges and can i wear them always pls share your inputs based upon experience"
Cataract,Mini-Monovision Range for Near and Intermediate,"Hi all. I have cataract surgery scheduled for my left eye in a week, to be followed later by my right eye. I prefer having near vision over distance, so I am aiming for mini-monovision to provide near and intermediate vision. I am going with monofocals (Technis) to reduce the possibility of night vision artifacts.I was thinking of -2.50 for my left eye and -1.50 for my right, but my eye surgeon strongly recommended targeting 2.00 for the left and -1.00 for the right. He said his patients who chose to be more myopic than that have not been happy with their range of vision. I agreed to go with his recommendation, but now I’m having second thoughts. If I have this right, targeting -2.50 to -1.50 would provide best focus at approximately 16 inches (40cm) to 26 inches (67cm), while -2.00 to -1.00 would provide best focus at 20 inches (50cm) to 39 inches (1m).With the difference between -2.50 and -2.00 only being 4 inches (10cm), I wonder if -2.50 to -1.00 would be that much more difficult to adapt to than -2.00 to -1.00.Any thoughts or suggestions?"

Cataract,Cataract Post-Surgery Vision Problem,"Had laser assisted surgery on left eye two months ago and right eye a month and a half ago. Both my OD and surgeon tell me that I now have 20/20 in left eye and 20/25 in right.However, I sometimes (intermittently) see a black vertical line to the temple side of each eye. Sort of like horse blinders. Doing online research, this could be a retina problem and/or droopy eyelid problem. The ""droopy eye"" problem is due to the clamp that was used to keep the eyelid open for eye surgery. Also read something about negative dysphotopsia (black line/cresent).Am wondering, if it is due to ""droopy eye"", if a eyelid tightening serum would work. If it's a retina problem????Comments, please."
Cataract,Mini-Mono or Multi-focal. Which one is better?,"This is my second post since joining the board. I am a 56 y/o healthy male. I was recently diagnosed with an advanced cataract in my left eye and an early stage cataract in my right eye. I also have Glacoma in the left eye which is being treated with Lanaprost eye drops.My left eye is 20/100 and my right eye is 20/40. I only see close to intermediate range in the left eye and medium to distance in the right eye. I have a slight astigmatism in my eyes as well. My optic nerve was checked and it’s in good shape and I am a good candidate for cataract surgery. I now see in mono-vision as my eyes have gotten worse in the last few years.My medical provider is a large HMO. The original surgeon I spoke to said I wasn’t a good candidate for multi-focal lenses due to the fact I have an Asigmatism and smaller shaped eyes. He recommended single vision lenses. But just recently I met with a different surgeon at another location but same HMO, that is well recommended and has a lot of Cataract surgeries under his belt with a high success rate. He looked at my eyes and charts and said he didn’t see anything that would prevent me from getting the multi-focal lenses. His only warning is that I may get some artifacts at night which I already have with the cataract.I did ask about doing a mini-mono arrangement. He said we can do that but he felt since I’m still relatively young I might miss having a full range of vision. He also said with the mini-mono I will probably need glasses for driving since I most likely won’t pass the driving exam without glasses due to having one near sighted eye.After reading the posts on this board for a few months now it seems that many of you are having issues with multi-vision lenses due to blurriness or artifacts issues. I guess what I'm wondering is it that much different using a mini-mono arrangement vs multi-focal and will the artifacts (halos and starbursts) at night worse than what I currently experience or just slightly annoying. I think I would prefer the multi-focal lenses and independence from glasses but I don't want problems down the road."
Cataract,Problem after cataract surgery,"Hi! I had cataract surgery on my left eye 2 weeks ago. Was fitted with mono vision Alcon lens. Had 4 post-op visits and was told that everything is perfect. And it was. I had 20/20 vision in the operated eye on the forth day after the surgery. Tonight I was looking at the black street sign with with white lettering and noticed that I see second row of letters on the top of the original ones. I have no problems reading, watching TV or working on the computer. But seeing this second row of letters scared me. Did anybody experienced something like that? Please help!"
Cataract,Follow up of exchange of an exchanged iol,"Friday was my monthly follow up from surgery on my right eye ( non dominate) i have a restor 3.0 multifocal toric that replaced an exchanged restor 2.5 multifical toric that was 1/2 way out of the bag.( original surgery 12/2017 where dr said it was the wrong power installed i am a previous lasik patient, exchanged in april 2018 with an addition 1.5 added power and discovered by getting a second opinion and about to have yag done that haptic was out of bag when really 1/2 the lens was out of bag viewed by 3rd opinion and current surgeon...also the lens was tilted at an angle causing my ghosting effect) im currently still on once daily drop of ilevro, and over the counter lubrication drops 4x daily. my near vision is 20/20, my distance does not register a prescription but is still out of focus. also, i do have a .50 astigmatism. surgeon believes all will continue to improve as days/weeks/months go on. i do see a shadow or rim effect out of corner of eye, but am told that is from incision and should go away.as for the left eye that still has a restor 2.5 multifocal lens, it is causing complications in the mini monovision area. i have 20/40 vision at best with this eye, but my distance is clearer/sharper than the recently replaced iol. my reading out of left eye is basically non existant. so my brain is going back and forth between eyes, which is not a good recommendation with the multifocal lenses. They should be working in tandem. dr says we can exchange left eye whenever i feel comfortable or we can leave it as is and do lasik to correct the distance only. i will be opting for the exchange.i was given much more information from this dr than my previous one. using a multifocal lens means you need to get it just right, not close enough. also, women require a 3.0 lens more than men, due to pupil differences, and the fact that we are just smaller. our visual range for reading is nearer, and the range for the 3.0 is closer in than the 2.5. the 3.0 has 12 concentric rings as opposed to 9 with the 2.5i will more than likely have the left eye exchanged in march. i would like to see the right eye distance come into view before i procede, because as of now, if both eyes were the same, at distance i would not feel comfortable to drive at all especially at night!!low light conditions really effect my vision. even cloudy days are a struggle im not sure how to respond to this yet. i hadnt expected outdoor vision to be compromised, and i live in sunny florida.hope this helps others in their decisions or complications of cataract surgery"
Cataract,flashes of light after cataract surgery,I had cataract surgery two and a half months ago on one eye and one and a half months ago on the other eye. About a couple of weeks ago I started having flashes of light on the outer side of both eyes. The light is kind of like a circle that sometimes starts at the bottom and travels upward and sometimes starts at the top and travels downward. Has anyone had this experience after having had cataract surgery this long ago?
Cataract,Intraocular lens with rounded edges for dysphotopsia,"There are hundreds, if not thousands of people complaining about edge-glare on this and many other forums. It's well documented that truncated, squared edges are the main cause of side-lighting glare, flickering. I'm suffering from this edge-glare since the day the lens was implanted, in 2017, so it's been almost 2 years after the operation and still perceive very annoying, not to say debilitating, side flickering of light, day and night. How is possible that in 2018, when surgeons make people see again after years of blindness, a SMALL problem as lens design like that is so neglected? How is possible that there is not any iol with rounded edges on the market to help people, even in their 30, 40, and 50, whom life is ruined because of intractable glare that does not decrease even after 15 months after the surgery?"
Cataract,Any experience/info about the AcuFocus IC-8 IOL?,Seems like this IOL (which functions like the Kamra inlay) is getting great results in Europe and elsewhere and will hopefully be coming to the US in the next year or two. Sounds like it could be as good of an option as the EDoFs but without all the nighttime issues of glare and halos like my Symfony has. Makes me wonder if it would be worth swapping out my Symfony for this and getting the recommended distance monofocal in my dominant eye. Thoughts?
Cataract,Only one good eye and it needs cataract surgery..,"Hi All,I lost one eye in an accident(Retinal detachement and could not get vision restored) and now my other good eye having blurry vision since last few months so I need to go through cataract surgery .. I visited couple of top specalists in my city and one of them suggesting multifocal and other suggesting monofocal as I have only one good eye. Can you please provide your opinions in my case what may be best sutiable ? The second doctor said he will set my vision with -1 correction as I work on computer most of my time. can you please provide your thoughts ?"
Cataract,eye hurts and burns after caterac surgery 24 hours ago,"why doe my eye hurts and burns, at different intervels, after my caterac surgery 24 hrs ago. my doctor said to be patient and in time it will heal. has anyone else experenced this after caterac surgery ?"
Cataract,YAG for PCO with mild epiretinal membrane.,"I have a mild epiretinal membrane and the beginnings of PCO. Although, my doctor does not think I need to do the YAG yet, I was just wondering if anyone has had any experience with YAG and how it effects the epiretinal membrane."
Cataract,Blurry vision after Yag laser 2 1/2 weeks ago,My Mom had cataract surgery October 2017. The right eye was perfect for about 3 weeks and then became blurry. The Dr. Said it was PCO and that the Yag procedure would fix it and she would see clearly in a few hours. Her vision has not gotten better. It is as if nothing was done. I took her to the Dr. today and she is seeing 20/70 which is worse than before the Yag(It was 20/60). Right after the surgery she was seeing around 20/40. The Dr. said the lens has moved back which is normal and can happen which is why she is not seeing clearly. He said the Yag worked and removed the cloudiness which makes no sense considering she still cannot see clearly. His only solution was to get glasses. She did not need them after surgery so should she need them now? I am just really upset to go through the Yag with no result at all. 
Cataract,Blurred vision after Symfony lens implant,"About 18 months ago, I had cataract surgey and an Symfony toric lens was implanted. During the day I have no problem. I can see distance fine and pretty well up close. I can see this screen fine but cannot read smaller print. My problem is at night. I have much worse vision now than I did before surgery. If I go into a movie theater, there is a glare all around the screen, same is true for television in the evening. Street lights have halos around them that I never had before. There is a glare that looks like I'm looking through oil on my lens. Within the halos, I can actually see the toric rings visible. It is very difficult to drive at night, walk in the neighborhood as the lights create large halos. Has anyone else had this problem?"
Cataract,Depressed about my sight after cataract surgery ,"been awhile since i posted here. i can see and read and see tv good but with glare still and blackish stuff in my vision. have had YAG surgery twice. have ReStore lens. changed Doctors. last week. having to use warm compresses , clean lashes with water diluted baby shampoo, 2 drops of Systane drops daily until i see him again February 20-19 . will this glare and blackish stuff ever go away? has anyone else experienced this ?"
Cataract,Warning over failed cataract surgery and subsequent successful surgery elsewhere,"In March 2017 I had private cataract surgery and a multi focal Zeiss lens inserted on one eye at a private hospital near Darlington UK.On removing the cover on my eye 12 hours later, the vision was extremely blurred but as the surgeon claimed that a dry eye was the cause, I allowed him to operate one week later on the other eye - and this proved relatively successful with clear non-blurred vision.Five weeks later the surgeon decided to operate again on the first eye and told me that he had rotated the lens but this made zero difference to my perceived vision. Unfortunately this surgeon's account of the whole cataract process on that first eye is very different from that of myself, the patient, which has greatly annoyed me.Subsequently I saw two separate surgeons in France who expressed surprise at what had happened and suggested the second operation on that first eye should have been to remove the lense. Also they pointed out that the lense was wrongly positioned which the UK surgeon later put down to fibrosis.The UK surgeon told me in July 2017 that he could do nothing and that removal of the badly positioned lense could be detrimental. He suggested that I go elsewhere and look for laser surgery by others - but in France, it was suggested that laser surgery could cause irreversible harm to vision.In October 2018, I had surgery in France where the earlier lense was removed and a new lense inserted with excellent results.I am writing this as a warning that whilst in my case I did accept that no surgical procedure is 100% guaranteed, there is always a potential reason for failure and probably it is wise to do research on the hospital and surgeon."
Cataract,symfony lens and blurred vision,I recently had symphony lens' in both eyes - operations were 2 weeks apart with the second being 5 days ago. My reading vision is fine but starts to go into soft focus looking across the room and beyond. Walking down the street - most things are out of focus so driving is not possible. The surgeon made adjustments to the calculations after the first eye to give the second greater distance but it seems about the same. The surgeon said I had vey small eyes and so maybe that is why the refraction is out. I also had this procedure duet to closed angle glaucoma rate than cataract.Has anyone else had this outcome and did it rectify itself as I appreciate it is still early days - or did you have further procedures?I recently had symphony lens' in both eyes - operations were 2 weeks apart with the second being 5 days ago.

Cataract,After cateract surgery ,hello is anyone on forum about cataract surgery
Cataract,Post-Surgery Droopy Eyelids,"First, I'm a 69 year old male who, last month, had Laser Cataract Surgery, with customized Astigmatism Lens inserted in each eye.Before the first surgery, I was not told by my surgeon about any risks concerning the surgery, especially the use of the eyelid speculum instrument, that keeps the eyelid open, or that two of the prescription eyedrops could affect the eyelid and there could be a ""burning"" sensation after using Durezol or Prolensa eyedrops. My surgeon stopped the use of the Durezol on the left eye less than a week after surgery, but continued with the Prolensa. As of now, Nov 21, I'm completely done with using prescription eyedrops, but still use Systane Ultra eyedrops.When I was 6, I was bit by a dog just below the corner (across from the ear) of my left eye. I've always had a very slight ""droop"" in that corner of the eye, due to the bit. Now, that eyelid is ""drooping"" more and I was told it was due to the eyelid speculum. The right eye ""droops"" as well, but not nearly as much as the left does. The main muscle in the eyelid has been weakened due to this instrument. This is really not impacting my vision, which now is 20/20 in left eye and almost the same in the right eye.So, has anyone here had this problem and what did you do about it? I read that it could take 4 to 6 months to re-strengthen the muscle in the eyelid. What about ""strengthening"" exercises for the eyelid or a eyelid serum for tightening the eyelid?"
Cataract,Advice needed - Cataract Surgery Lense Dilemma (after a vitrectomy),"First, thank you in advance for any advice or experience you might be able to share. Eight months ago, I underwent emergency eye surgery for a detached retina (vitrectomy). The retina has healed but I've now developed a cataract. I've seen two highly regarded cataract surgeons. One referred to me by my eye surgeon (retina specialist) and the other referred by a number of local optometrists. Both cataract surgeons have recommended two different plans! One surgeon recommends removing the cataract and inserting a lens for improving distance vision. My ""good"" eye would need Lasik surgery two weeks or so later though. Otherwise, I'm told, my eyes will be in ""conflict"" with each other and glasses won't remedy the problem. He believes this plan will provide me with a chance to be free of glasses, except for needing readers. The other surgeon recommends inserting a near distance lens for close up vision. I would then not need surgery on the ""good"" eye. Since I have been nearsighted all my life and have worn glasses/contact lenses to correct my vision, the close up lens makes sense to me. Close up vision is what I'm used to and I only have the one eye with a cataract. Everyone who has had cataract surgery seems to go with distance lenses though - and who wouldn't want to be free of glasses? What would you do? Has anyone had experience with the near vision lens? This is all so nerve wracking and I sincerely appreciate advice!"
Cataract,Need some thoughts please cataract surgeries,Hello to all. Need some help. i am 46 years old and very active. i had bilateral catarac surgeries one year ago. In my right dominant eye i put a symphony lens which is an extended depth of focus premium lens. In my left eye i did a multifocal tecnis low add 3.25. 3 Months after surgey i had yags done on both eyes ti do opacifiaction. AFTER THAT THE STUFF THAT WAS LASERED OFF MY LENS WAS STUCK IN MU FIELD OF VISION CAUSING A REFLECTIVE SHIMMERING IN MY EYES WHEN LIGHTS Hit it. IT WAS MADDENING. SO I THEN WENT TI RETINA DR AND HAD VITRECTOMY ON EACH EYE WHICH WAS THE BEST THING EVER. IT GOT RID OF ALL THE PROBLEMS I WAS HAVING.NOW FAST FORWARD TI NOW. I AM HAVING THE WORST TIME ADJUSTING TO THE TWO DIFFERENT LENSES ONE YEAR LATER. SHOUKD I GET A PIGGIE BACK LENS OR SHOULD I JUST ADJUST WITH CONTACTS OR GLASSES? FROM READING A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THEY DONT NEED ny glasses after having two SYMPHOMY LENSES IMPLANTED. i cant see my phone with this lens wothout readers. anybsuggestions or thoughts on the symphony lens??
Cataract,Muro 128,has anyone used muro 128 over the counter eye drops? My last surgeon suggested it as an option to help clear up the haziness after surgery
Cataract,My surgeon fired me today!,"Today I had my 2 week follow up after I was told I had inflammation in my Symfony eye. The tech when checking my vision said that my last visit was for dry eye. What??? I was told I had inflammation not dry eye. My immediate concern face, which is it? Had some more testing done, my distance today 20/20 reading 20/25. IOP 10 in each eye.Dr. comes in and starts talking about how great my numbers are and how dry eye can affect vison. I'm like but I thought it was inflammation? I'm confused and concerned. This Dr. likes to talk and go off on tangents. He asks how my vision is on a 20 scale? I'm confused, like 1-10? He goes off on another tangent about eagles being able to see a pine needle. I tell him again that my initial concerns were my distance vision being blurry and my night artifacts, and that I'm pleased with near vision. I said I didn't understand about the distance and being left myopic (which he confirmed at my last visit). He said he didn't target me myopic but for best vision and went on again about healing and how it changes. So my concern face grows more, I know what he told me last time. He did another slit lamp and still saw a few cells, more anti-inflammatory for another week. He did a tear stain and said I'm a 5-7.He then started telling me that I'm not a happy patient, that he can see it in my face. I told him I want to understand things, he goes off on another tangent about how he invents things but how he doesn't have the knowledge to integrate it a computer, and that he went to med school. He basically says that he's the doctor and he would like me to just be a patient. I told him I felt that things were not being explained to me, that last time it was inflammation, now it's dry eye, the appointment screw up etc. He then said he wouldn't feel comfortable doing my other eye surgery. That no matter if my results with that eye were great from his perspective, I would be unhappy. He said the more time he spends with me takes away from his other patients. He says my right eye is not that bad and that I should hold off and then find another surgeon when it becomes untolerable. He says we only did your left eye because of the severe glare you were having and the right eye can wait. Told him last visit he said to get the right eye scheduled ASAP, he said they would cancel it.I'm p****d to say the least."
Cataract,Cataract Surgery with Lens Replacement,"I had cataract surgery with a lens replacement almost 4 weeks. The surgery went great and I see perfectly in the eye I had done. I am occasionally experiencing a feeling like I have a contact in my eye and involuntarily blink. This doesn't last long, but is bothersome when I am driving. Sunlight and air seem to cause it. I am taking Prednisolone Acetate Ophtolmic Suspension USP drops while my eye heals and hope thus is just a side effect. What do you think?"
Cataract,Exchange of an exchanged iol,"just giving and update on my conditionoriginally i had cataract surgery in dec 2017 with a local opthomologist i chose to have multifocal lenses implanted in both eyes, the right having a toric to correct astimatism . i am a previous lasik patientthe first surgery didnt go as expected ""the power is off"" said the dr. i had a reator 2.5 toric implanted i couldnt see better than 20/60 and had a ghosting effect dr said yes lets proceed to next eye as planned one week later, ""i know what to do"" left eye done end of dec 2017 never got better vision than 20/50even though he went up +1.0 in power. april 2018 we exchanged right eye with restor 2.5 with a 1.5 power stronger. dr claims to have done few exchanges after initial surgery i still had visual disturbances ghosting and i could see a rim effect that never went away 4 months post surgery dr says lets do yag in left eye then i can have lasik enhancement ...went for lasik evaluation to original lasik center ( millenium) . ""yes we can correct distance, but it will do nothing for close up ( whats the point of having multifocal in this case??) go to another catarct surgeon for another opinion on left eye and why i have rim effect and ghosting effects on right eye ""slight tilt in right eye , and wrinkles in retina, bag and on cornea . ""lets dialate and proceed to yag in right eye"" upon dilation, dr says haptic is out of bag cone see me in 4 months see your optomitist in 2 months, also that hes never operated /exchanged a lens in this situatuon i go to another dr for another opinion ( sister company to who did my lasik in 2001, also i know they are @$4k per eye for speciality lenses). this dr has seen and operated on similar situatuons but would prefer to use restor 3.0 toric to bring in reading distance ( there is a lot more to this story than what im typing).i had surgery nov 1 thursday with dr shatz at sight truat in sunrise florda cost $3750 per exchange i have a thumb drive of my surgery where i can plainly see the old iol 1/2 way out of the bag i can see where the bag (capsule that holds the lens in place) had adheard to itself. the recorded time of surgery was 32 minutes (i arrived at 2:30 departed office at 6) today is sunday and my vision is similar to looking through plastic i am on durezol 2x daily moxifloxon 3x daily ilevo 1x day and natural tears ( refresh or systane preservative free) at least 4x day. my one day follow up went as expected my healing time will take longer than usual dr had to make 3 incisions to complete the surgery . dr also gave the name of an over the counter med to help clear things up a day or two faster as of now i have not bought it i have no pain associated with surgery ( although my shoulders are stiff from nerves) .all in all im grateful for surgeon and his ability to reopen the bag and get the iol where it ahould be outcomes may not be 20/20 but at least i will not have a haptic floating around in my eye rubbing against the iris anymore which would have caused problems down the road.im kicking myself for not going to dr shatz firat it is a 3 hour drive from home, so picking convenience over my gut instinct did not pay off in the long runi will be sending a letter to my original surgeon stating my condition. perhaps i will receive some compensation for all the trouble he has put me though if not, i will know exactly what kind of person he is and will do my best to inform others to stay away from him"
Cataract,"Symfony 8 week follow up appointment with surgeon, Inflammation","Had an appointment with my surgeon today. Scheduling had messed up and didn't have me down as having an appointment because of the cancellation of my right eye surgery. This was supposed to be a follow up on my left Symfony eye which I have been experiencing positive dysphotopsia (halos, starbursts, ghosting and glare). My surgeon and I decided to hold off on the right eye at my 1 week follow up to see how symptoms resolved themselves. I also had complaints of blurry distance vision.Testing results: I'm still experiencing glare but it is reduced and not bothering me as much. With glare testing I was able to see the letters this time. My reading vision in my Symfony eye is 20/20 and distance is 20/25. With a 0.5 diopter correction distance is 20/20. IOP is 7 in left eye and 8 in right eye.Consult with surgeon: I'm a little frustrated that he did not have my chart because of the appointment screw up. I had to remind him of our last appointment discussion. At that time I was experiencing bad glare, and night vision issues (halos, starbursts) and daytime ghosting on reflective images. I'm still experiencing daytime ghosting but it's not as noticeable and I seem to be able to tune it out (neural adaptation?) for the most part. I still get halos & starbursts and yes spiderweb effect from lights. I think they are subsiding somewhat also but still very present. At my last appt. he said I had a posterior capsular fold which could be contributing to these aberations. He went to do the slit lamp exam and said I have inflammation and could see cells. He didn't even look to see if the fold had resolved (My optometrist said it was mostly resolved a few weeks ago). He instructed me to start using the anti-inflammatory drops again for the next two weeks and return for another exam.He did target my left non-dominate eye to be slightly myopic (near sighted) for better near vison. He said he was targeting for -.25 and with healing it usually changes +.5, he didn't want to overshoot it because that would leave me hyperopic (far sighted) which would not be a good outcome. Now I fully undersand why my distance vision with my Symfony eye is slightly off. We did discuss surgery on my right eye and he thinks (like my optometrist) that once both eyes are done I will notice less night vision issues over time. We discussed targeting the right for plano. He did tell me he has only had one patient that he put in a monofocal lens with a Symfony because of night vision issues, and only one other patient that found night vision issues extremely bothersome. He said this woman wagged her finger at him she was so upset, but when he asked if she wanted to exchange the lenses she refused because she didn't want to give up the great near & intermediate vision. He asked if I was going to wag my finger at him. Told him, not yet!So now my questions are is inflammation 2 months post surgery common? Is this a real serious issue? Why don't I have symptoms (ie: pain, redness, blurriness, scratchy feeling etc.) I'm to use the Ilevro drops twice a day for a week then once a day for a week. I go back to see him in 2 weeks. Sigh. In the mean time his office should be calling me to schedule surgery on my right eye.Joanne"
Cataract,Cataract star burst,"I had cataract surgery on both eyes. Vision cleared up, but star bursts appeared. I mentioned this to the Dr. , and 'give it time, it should clear up"", was the reply. NOPE... it's gotten worse. THE QUESTION FOR READERS, with similar problem... my 'bursts' are always on the same plane. Right eye a 10 to 4 O'clock flair.. Left eye 1 to 7 O'clock flair. This causes a X star burst with headlights, streetlights, etc. with both eyes open. COULD THE CATARACT IMPLANTS BE SCRATCHED? If not, wouldn't the 'burst' rotate slightly and not be fixed? Can the implant be rotated to see if the 'flair' changes it's orientation?"
Cataract,Mono Focal Lens for Intermediate Vision,"I am a 67 year old male. I will be having cataract surgery on my right eye in December. My left eye also has a cataract, but does not need to be removed any time soon. So, I have decided to leave it alone for as long as possible as my vision is 20/25 in that eye. I will be going with mono focal lens with mini monovision. My vision is currently -.50D in the left and -5.50D in the right without correction. My left eye is dominant. I would like to use my left eye for distance and my right eye for intermediate, so that I can work on a desktop computer and see the dashboard of my car. I realize that I will probably need to use glasses for reading.I met with my ophthalmologist on Thursday. I just recently read his notes online from my exam and I noticed that my surgeon wrote, ""Right eye aim -1.25 to 1.50."" Would this be the appropriate correction for seeking mini monovision? I have read in other posts that a -1.0 is best for intermediate vision. I would appreciate hearing other people about this apparent discrepancy. Thank you"
Cataract,Symfony exchanged for an Acufocus IC-8 with good results,"Well I have had a Symfony toric lens exchanged for an Acufocus IC-8 about 4 weeks ago in the UK and the result is much better.I had severe glare, halo even in the day around a window looking out and tvs etc. and shocking halos and starbursts around car headlights not to mention the dreaded multiple rings.I waited for 4 months with the Symfony but nothing improved.The IC-8 has a bit of glare around night time light sources but nothing like as bad with the Symfony.I can read from 12 inches and see well to distant hills.There is a bit of contrast reduction i would say 20% due to the small aperture but in the daythis is not noticeable only in low light where better artificial lighting is required.There are no starbusrts,concentric circles or halo !The IC-8 is not made in a toric version as it does not need to be due to the characteristics of its small aperture design.So far much happier with this IOL. ?"
Cataract,mini monovision,"My opthalmologist originally told me that the power difference between my eyes after cataract surgery would be about .50 . However, the IOL power on the cards I was given after surgery are 14.5 D in dominant eye and 15.5 D in non dominant eye. This seems to me like a difference of 1.0. I have read that a difference larger than 0.75 is hard for the brain to adjust to. Am I correct that the difference between my eyes is 1.0?"

Cataract,How have you been advised to taper steroid drops post cataract surgery?,"I had my first eye done two days ago and have been improving over the two days so I am happy. I have antibiotic drops 4 times daily for one week. BUT I'm a little worried about my steroid drops: 4 times daily for FIVE WEEKS and then stop.I always thought you had to taper steroids so wondering what you guys ""post surgery"" have been advised.RegardsMary"
Cataract,Symfony or not? Can someone help!,"I am 62 years with a more dense cataract in my right eye than the left. I am managing all activities with glasses. No blurriness with prescription glasses. I have had mono vision all my life with very small numbers in both eyes. Since 3 years I have started seeing starbursts while driving at night without glasses and my vision got blurry gradually. My right eye is near sighted and left eye seems to be the dominant eye. I work on computer for 5-6 hours a day. I can read the screen but I am more comfortable with glasses. I saw many eye doctors and they suggested mono focal or Symfony lens. Recently I found a very good eye surgeon in my area that says he can give me whatever type of lenses I want. He offers mono vision or mini-mono vision as well as all types of multi focal options. He said I have very little astigmatism and do not need correction at this time.I have blocked a date with him 3 weeks later for mono focal IOLs in both eyes. He will use a technology to measure my power during surgery and can give precise number. However he said with mini mono vision my right eye will read cell phone screen but I will need readers for very small print.First he is doing my right eye for near vision with mono focal. I am thinking of asking him to do a mix and match for me. Do a perfect near vision for my right eye first. My left eye has distance vision with less dense cataract. Not enough to watch TV or drive without prescription glasses. I may use glasses until my right eye surgery is done. I am wondering if I should stick to mini mono vision with a mono focal in both eyes or get a Symfony lens for my left eye (or right eye?) and mono focal for the other eye. My objective is to get all three zones by combining the abilities of two types of lenses. I believe Symfony lens does not provide very good near vision. Therefore, considering mono focal in one eye. Which eye should I do first?I read this forum posts and have educated myself on all terminologies but I am not able to communicate that to my doctor or here very well. I am afraid he will think I am trying to tell him how to do his work. Any advice? Thoughts?"
Cataract,Multifocal lenses,"Recently I had done cataract surgery on both eyes with multifocal lens. I was told by my doctor that the halo around the lights and the web of rings will go away once my brain gets used to the lens. I decided to go with multifocal lens because I know someone that did it and he had no side effects whatsoever, he has perfect vision at night. Just a lens cost $2,500 per eye, are there different types multifocal lens? Did I miss something here? Please share your opinion I'll greatly appreciate it.Recently I had done cataract surgery on both eyes with multifocal lens.

Cataract,Cataract surgery on one or both eyes?,"Hi,I've had a cataract on my right eye for a few years already. There hasn't been any significant changes in the last few years, it just does not get any worse. I've pretty much learned to live with one good eye, and the other one, that is I'd say at about 30-40% of its full capability.There is a very mild cataract on the left eye too, which does not bother me at all, I can't even notice it. It's also been status quo for years. I'd like to have surgery on my bad (right) eye, but I'm not sure what to do exactly.My prescription glasses are -3.25 L and -4.0 R, progressive lenses. So there is no way to ""zero"" the right eye, without having the surgery on the good left eye too, because of vision imbalance (anisometropia). So, as my ophthalmologist says, I have 2 options. Either I have surgery on my right eye only, and bring the prescription to about -2, or I ""zero"" the right eye, and have another surgery a month later, on the ""good"" left eye, bringing it to zero as well. Obviously, the first option would require me to keep on wearing glasses, and the second, if everything goes well, might get rid of the glasses, with the exception of the need for reading glasses.Frankly, I have no idea how to proceed. I was postponing going to the surgery, thinking that my good eye will start developing cataract more rapidly, and I'd have to have both done. But the way it is, I just don't know if I should only have an operation on the eye that needs it, and leave the other one as is, at the same time leaving the idea that one day I could throw away my glasses.Any feedback will be highly appreciated, especially if you have, or had the same dilemma: surgery on one eye only, or both, even the one without cataract.Thanks!"
Cataract,"My Symfony IOL results, 2018","Hi, I wanted to post this thread to add to the discussion about Symfony IOLs.So far I am very happy.I had my right eye surgery yesterday, for a worsening cataract in my Right Eye which was effecting my vision enough to make me want to proceed. The plan is do also operate on my left eye next week to provide balanced vision since the left eye cataract is not that bad.I am 53 and have worn glasses since I was about 10. I am near sighted and now have presbyopia for which I have been using progressive lens for the past 5 years. I have a very mild astigmatism in my right eye, but not enough to require a Toric lens. Enough for a starter, since when I tried to start this thread yesterday it was blocked pending approval by the Moderator? My post on The Full Moon and Effects of Radiation on eye surgery were posted immediately, so I don't understand why that thread is held up.Mike"
Cataract,Vision Correction After Surgery If Vision Was Really Bad,"Hello, new to the group. Thanks. Oct. 16, I'll have surgery on my right eye - cataract. Duke Eye Center, Durham NC. Old school style, not laser, Medicare - so just the most basic lens replacement. I've got a Central Retina Vein Occlusion situation in my left eye, much of its vision will probably never return. Idea ( ""eye""dea?) was to make the one good eye (right) as good as possible. Thing is: I won't have my left eye to rely on much after surgery. Worried mostly about driving. My vision is (has been for decades) really bad in both eyes, very strong myopic prescription. AND I have astigmatism. What are the chances that my right eye (the being operated on) will improve enough to drive a few days after surgery? I expect the vision to improve enough to make my current eyeglass prescription useless. I'm pretty sure that there is no way for Medicare / medicaid to pay for the astigmatism to be corrected.

Cataract,Flickering light with monofocal lenses in both eyes,"Hi all!I'm 44 years old and had lens exchanged in both eyes. I have mild keratoconus too, so surely irregular cornea but I can see 20/20 on both eyes. I have two different models of iol, in one eye silicone, in the other acrylic, both lens have squared truncated edges and low refractive index, 6 mm of diameter.After 2 years since the first eye operated and 1,5 after the second, I'm still very sensitive to light and still bothered by a very annoying phenomena several other people here reported. In relatively low lighting I can see a luminous circle or half circle on the opposite side of the light source with some light streaks coming from the light source itself. Since the shape of the disturbance is circle or half circle it has to do with the lens shape: a circle. Probably its edge.It happens also during the day with very strong lighting (ceiling reflectors), usually inside. Since eye does not move 'fluidly' but with tiny jerky movements called 'saccades', the perception of this circle and the light streaks are also jerky, like a flickering caused by the reflected lens combined with saccades. Using a myotic drops like Alphagan, constrict the pupil a little so the annoying presence of edge glare at night disappears. It happens only with off-axis (side) rays, never with frontal rays. With strong light I cannot perceive the edge (circles) but only light flickering, strobe-effect like, because light is strong enough to enter the eye, hitting the edge even with relatively small pupil aperture. After 2 years I don't think it will go away. Therapy? No iol exchange, obviously, too risky, and because I have two different model and both cause the same problem. Unfortunately iol with rounded edge that should help to spred reflected rays on a larger area are practically all discontinued. Another option is piggybacking a iol with rounded edges in the sulcus, like the Sulcoflex (Rayner). Lately another even more interesting lens was invented, it's called Xtrafocus pinhole (Morcher) and it's based on the pinhole principle. I'm wondering how a lens in the sulcus can deviate the light from hitting the primary lens' edges and stop causing edge glare. Someone had these lens implanted? Any thought?Thanks in advance for any suggestion or helpPhil"

Cataract,It is time for surgery!,Date: 9.26.2018Age: 42Diagnosed: 7.31.2017Presbyopia Onset: 12/2015Pre-cataract glasses: -2 both eyes. Slight astigmatism in the right eye. Just remove glasses for near. +1 actually makes near blurry.Vision: Cataracts in both eyes. Nuclear and posterior sub capsular. Vision in left eye severely impacted with blurred triple vision @ 20/60 or worse. Right eye had been holding up until now but now it is at 20/30 and creating weird artifacts when light is involved even during daytime. Initially only green colored light were impacted. Night time light source looks like a snow flake with both eyes open. Looks like a comet with the right eye. Looks like a circle of light with the left eye. The circle gets smaller as I get closer to the light. Left eye practically unusable. Earlier I could use it to read by getting close to the monitor.IOL choice: Symfony (Non-Toric) 16.5D which should leave me myopic around -0.3D.All evaluations (4): indicate early stage cataracts but unfortunately in the visual axis.Surgery in left eye: 10/2018Contemplating surgery in right eye: 11/2018. Bu the eye is usable. Can be corrected to 20/20 but the weird light distortions cannot be correct. Would love to move surgery on this eye to 2020.Worried about:a) Symfony night time halos. Currently see every light source at night like a snow flake.b) PCO/YAGd) Retina detachment. (Age and Hereditary)e) Long eye. I have a long eye which can be challenge to calculate the IOL power. Barrett method is recommended for such eyes. 
Cataract,Question About A Trace Cataract ,"Hello,About 6 or 7 years ago, while giving me a dialated eye exam, my optometrist said something about me having a trace cataract. But he said it was nothing to worry about. Every year I see him for a check up and ask how does the cataract look? He says it's nothing to worry about. Well he retired this spring, so I had to find a new doctor. I starting asking my friends about eye doctors and who they liked. One doctors name kept coming up, followed by how good he is. He was a cataract and retinal specialist. I saw him Monday and asked him about my cataract and how it looks. He said it's a trace cataract and nothing to worry about. I said it doesn't require treatment? He said no, don't worry about it. Made me feel good, but I still have something there. Is a trace cataract really nothing to worry about? Will it get worse all always just be there as a trace cataract?

Cataract,Ghost image & Floaters following cataract surgery,"Hello folks the date is 17May2018.... I had surgery on both eyes recently about 1 month apart. The right eye was done 19Mar2018 and the left on 10Apr2018. The right was a textbook procedure and I am very pleased with result. I have clear 20/20 vision. The left eye was problematic. The lens capsule was torn during the procedure and I have retained lens fragments (RLF). The RLF appear as very annoying floaters in my field of view (FOV). They seem to be dissolving somewhat but still a problem. I do have 20/20 vision, so I am grateful for that. Also I have ghost image at the ""2 o clock"" position, most noticeable when looking at light sources or reflected light. I suspect the ghost image is the result of misalignment of the IOL. The Dr. says he placed it in such a way as to prevent vitreous from back of my eye from entering front of eye. Question: has anyone experienced this side effect and what was your outcome. I am considering having the lens repositioned. The Dr. says the lens position is find and the ghost image is an ""artifact"" that has no real solution? I understand waiting too long to have the IOL repositioned increases the risk of complications. I played a round of golf 2 days ago and the vision was great in the daylight, with the exception of the ever present floaters racing around my FOV. Any input, advice or comments are welcome.

Cataract,Billing/Femto/NY Medicare ,My Mom had Femto 11 months ago which the doctor charged her 2800- for. He was insistent that the cataract was so dense that this was the only way to do it with a good result(this was the second doctor who said only to do Femto). She did not want/get specialty lenses. I understood that this was not covered and would have to pay. My mom did sign a form but it was checked off where the doctor was still supposed to submit the bill but never did. I have learned alot over the year. I did not know that a doctor could not charge for the Femto unless he was placing a specialty lens or doing a astigmatism ketatotomy. Neither of these things were explained. While doing the exam really just in the air said and while I am doing the laser I will fix this small astigmatism. I never thought anything about it or even knew what it was. It just seemed that while removing the cataract he could fix something minor. In the original papers my Mom signed I could barely read what was written besides Femto and thought nothing of it. I now know they wrote LRI which I now have learned what it is and it was never explained. My mom never even knew she had an astigmatism and certainly would not have done it. This was the way the dr could charge her. She would not have agreed to pay 2800- for this procedure. Her cataract sugery in one eye has been bad/blurry since 3 weeks after surgery. She had Yag 3 weeks ago with no positive result. She went to the dr yesterday and her vision is worse since the Yag. It was 20/70 after the Yag and 20/60 before. After the cataract surgery she was seeing better than 20/30. He says the cloudiness is gone yet my mom sees worse. He now says the lens has fallen back a little which is why her vision is worse. Then why put her through the Yag for no reason. He assured her the vision would be as clear as after surgery. He pretty much said the only thing to do now is get glasses. I have done nothing against this dr but now I feel he charged 2800- that he should not have. I really need an advocate/help as to what to do. Can My mom get copies of my moms records from the dr? She had previously seen another dr who also wanted to do Femto and was pushing all these specialty lenses. I am getting those records to see if she even had an astigmatism that needed surgery on. I am just tired of these dishonest doctors. I just read a local dr I had gone to has to pay 7 million dollars because of fraud. I did not want to proceed with this grievance until after she was done seeing him. He know just said come back in a year. Thanks for listening. It is all upsetting especially since she cannot see well.
Cataract,No vision ,Is it normal to have blurry vision is it normal after 4 weeks of cataracts and lense implant surgery 
Cataract,Cataract Surgery ,"Experienced considerable anxiety prior to surgery however the surgeon's team were very friendly and went out of their way putting me at ease. I decided to go with the custom multi focal lens. I had the surgery done on Tuesday, 18, 2018, I was under the impression I would be awake during the procedure, however, found they put me under and toward the later part of the procedure I woke and then it became the best of 3 rounds however, as soon as the Dr. spoke I realize where I was and remainder of the surgery went well.I went for a follow-up the following day and apparently the Dr. is pleased with the results. I am not experiencing any side effect however the sight in the eye with the replacement lens is a bit clouding but the Dr. indicated it is to be expected and over time my vision will improve. Next visit is in a couple weeks, waiting for outcome before deciding whether to have the other eye done.Appreciate member's comments and suggestions prior to surgery; I thank you!!"

Cataract,Post Op cataract removal weak and tired eye. Possible ptosis,I have cataract removed on left eye on 8-28-18 and left eye on 9-11-18. The first eye is giving me a lot of issues. I can only stay up for 10-11 hours and then my eye keeps wanting to shut. It is a lot smaller than my right eye. It gets smaller as the day goes on. Going in tomorrow to see doctor only after fighting with them a whole day. It feels like something is in the upper part of my eye. They kept telling me to use the lubricating drops all day and I have. I made sure it was the preservative free ones.Quite expensive as I am low income. They said it sounds like an eyelid problem which is not related tot he surgery but I believe the lid speculum might have caused this. I have read about the ptosis happening after the procedure. I had the problem the first week and they said keep using the lubricating drops. Then the second week and so on. Has anyone else had this problem. Greatly appreciated. Ruby S
Cataract,"Symfony lens 5 days post surgery, distance vision ","I had my surgery this past Monday. My surgeon recommended both eyes closed for 48 hrs. I complied, mostly any how on Wednesday my distance vision seemed crisp and clear. Near, not so much. On Thursday I download and printed a Jaeger chart to gauge my near vision which was about a J8, but I noticed my distance wasn’t as sharp. Friday (post surgery day 4) my distance was noticeably blurry but I could read J4/3 on the chart. Saturday I download and printed a Snellen chart and my distance vision was 20/32 comfortably and 20/25 with a little struggle, I was able to read J2/1 on the Jaeger chart. Is it normal for distance vision to decrease like this? I’m scheduled for my other eye in 2 weeks. I’ve had very good distance vision since lasik surgery almost 20 years ago."

Is there a better way? Thanks in advance."

Cataract,After had both cataract surgery since March 2018 and need your help ...,"Several months ago I had cataract surgery on both eyes - I had new lenses put in under each eye. One eye is fine, but in the other eye I can see a small dark mark which looks like it could be a scratch or crack in the new lens that maybe could have happened during surgery. They eye surgeon keeps checking it, but says that there is nothing wrong with the lens. I waited 3 months then had him and also another doctor check it again and they both still say that the eye is perfect. It especially bothers me when driving in bright sunlight - the view is perfect except for the small dark lines or cracks in the center. Has anyone experienced this problem? Please reply if you have and what you did about it. Thank you! -- Brett"
Cataract,Halos following cataract surgery,I had cataract surgery yesterday and this morning I can see halos with my operated eyeIs this normal and what should I expect during my recovery?
Cataract,Problems,Need opinions. I had bilateral cataract surgery back in October 2017. My right eye done first which is my dominant eye. This has a symphony lens for distance. 3 weeks later I had left eye done with a symphony multi focal lens. After both surgeries in January I had a cloudy film again which was opacifiaction and Dr said with a simple yag laser it would be good to go. So I got both eyes done in January. After that the stuff that was lasered off my eyes was like shards off glass in my field of vision. He assured me this would subside. Well after 5 months it did not so I met with a retina specialist and had a vitrectomy which was the best thing I’ve done yet. He said it was like I had tinsel for better words scattered in my eye. Now it’s time to get the left eye done in a few weeks. Having said all of this I am getting extreme eye tension headaches due to not so great vision. It’s like there is a spot in my field of vision that the lenses are fighting over one another. I am really regretting getting the two different lenses now and my eyes battle each other everyday. I really don’t know what to do. Should I consider lasik or a piggyback lens to get better vision. I can’t deal with these terrible headaches everyday. Any thoughts or help would be greatly appreciated.Thanks in advance

Cataract,no improvement after cataract surgery,"My mother had her right eye operated 5 weeks ago in London on NHS. it was supposed to be straight forward operation without complications on an easy cataract. Before she have wore glasses for ling distance save for the last two years when presumably vision deteriorated due to the cataract and a slight astigmatism (0.5) developed. We went for a check up a week ago i.e. 4 weeks after the operation. Her distant vision has not really improved. it is still blurry and doubles. The revised prescription glasses do not really help. the optometrist said that she went from +0.5 to -0.75 i.e. he reading vision improved slightly but the long-distant one deteriorated. In addition, this eye started to produce tears non-stop. This is the first time after the operation at the check up last week both ophthalmologist and optometrist said that there is no infection. We do not understand as the ophthalmologist pre-operation stated that the long-distant one should become near perfect with astigmatism disappearing. At the one and only check-up at the hospital the doctor said to go get glasses adjusted and come in 2 month!!, and then they will list her for a left eye operation which has 2-3 months way anyway... What should we do right now? i am totally confuse which way we should be going in th respect of the operarted eye and my mum is super depressed..."
Cataract,Iol arm out of the bag ,"I’ve had two exchanges of restor 2.5 multifocal toric iol in my right eye. Today I went to a second opinion dr at baptist medical to see what can be done with the left eye as I do not have 20/20 in distance let alone anywhere else . This is my first dialation exam since exchange in April this year. First initial exam was everything looks ok. Want to have yag in right eye today? I said I would think about it and let them know if I wanted to do it ( not good with quick decisions when it comes these things). Dr says I have wrinkles in my retina ( so now I’ve been told wrinkles in cornea after surgery, wrinkles in bag by lasik evaluation 2 weeks ago and now wrinkles in the retina. Apparently I have wrinkles everywhere ) So we dialate. Dr looks through the slit lamp : straight ahead. To the right. To the left. To the right again. Blah blah blah. Quick look at left eye. Goes back to right eye and pulls away. We can’t do yag. The “arm” ( can’t recall the technical term right now as we are driving home) of the iol is outside of the bag. This happens . Do you have pressure issues? Do you have pain? The “ arm” is rubbing , some people feel this. So do not. I’d like to see you in 4 months. In the mean time see your local optomists to check pressure and vision in 2 months. Also he says we can not exchange with the same lens I have in there now. So i assume that means I go with a clear lens and be done with it. I’m beyond frustrated "

Cataract,YAG following Cataract Surgery,My Mom had the YAG laser done yesterday in one eye(she had Cataract Surgery 10 months ago)Her right eye has been blurry since 2 weeks after the surgery. Yesterday afternoon she had the YAG done. This morning her vision is still blurry as if nothing was done. The Doctor made it sound like her vision would be clear in an hour. I looked around online and it does not say anywhere that the vision is better in an hour. I would appreciate any input on your experience with this procedure.How long before you could see better? 
Cataract,Lasik enhancement evaluation after cataract surgery ,"Here’s my latest update. Had cataract surgery right eye dec 2017 (restor multifocal toric ) and left eye (restor multifocal) one week later. The first eye “power was off” so an iol exchange occurred in April 2018. I am a previous lasik patient. Left eye was corrected to what dr thought I was “off” ( I now believe dr should have gone up +2.0 in both eyes. Not +1.5 in right and +1.0 in left ORA was used in all surgeries)So today, I had a lasik enhancement evaluation with the original clinic who did my lasik in 2001. Dr says only left eye is a viable candidate. As right eye measures at -.25 to -.50. And lasik may not give any improvement. Left eye measures -.75 +.75 x095. And a slight PCO was noticed. Dr also says the right eye lens has a slight tilt to it. ( ironically the original right eye lense also had a mild tilt so we concluded that’s just how that eye wants the implanted lense to set) . I wasn’t ready to commit to the procedure as YAG has been suggested before lasik because it could change the visual results. My right eye vision is 20/25 and the drs all seem happy with that. I am not. I have a shadow/ghosting in the 2o’clock position, and now some fuzziness due to pco. The distance vision is worse than before surgery. So I may have actually been 20/22.5( but we don’t measure for that inbetween stage) before surgery. Just slightly off, perhaps due to a slight astigmatism that I chose not to correct during lasik in 2001. Left eye is my dominate eye. And I was reading 20/30 but struggling to get 4/5 letters. 20/40 was better. What the lasik dr suggested was to try glasses to see if I would be happy with lasik enhancement results ( I like this idea). She wrote a script for Plano right eye and the above prescription for the left. Set for distance. The idea is to see if my reading distance would be better or worse. And if a lense exchange would be a viable option, as the cataract surgeon suggested months ago, but has now recanted that offer. He believes lasik or PRK would be a better solution. So, although I did receive similar information, I’m still at a loss at what to do next. I will sit on this info for a few days then decide. In the mean time I have ordered glasses with new prescription and will try them out for a while. My goal was to be glasses free. The suggestion to have yag first before lasik was reinforced, as yag can change prescription. But I need to feel good about the lenses I have before yag is done, as it is very difficult to do an exchange after yag. Still hoping for clear vision at all ranges but I would settle for just one right now without the need of glasses. "
Cataract,Vision after cataract and minimally invasive glaucoma surgery,I had cataract surgery and micro stent placement for glaucoma in Left Eye in May 2018 and right eye in August 2018. I still see light dispersion when I look at light or headlight of oncoming traffic at night. I also have slight hazy and blurry vision . How long does it take for the vision to recover completely .of note I had myopia and astigmatism and have toric lenses put in both eyes. It is very difficult to read cell phone or letters without reading glasses Any suggestions ??
Cataract,Symfony and Amblyopia?,"I have Symfony lenses and see 20/20 both eyes for distance.However, for near vision one eye is J8 while the other is J4 meaning I can read newsprint with one eye but not the other. If I put on a pair of reading glasses, I can read much better.My doctor says he can do nothing as I have Amblyopia or lazy eye.This seems odd to me because I am 50 years old and never had anyone suggest this to me all my life - and before surgery when I had my natural lenses and used glasses I could see equally well in both eyes at both distance and near (newsprint equally well in both eyes)So, I guess I'm not understanding how Amblyopia is the cause? And with amblyopia it sounds like the reading glasses wouldn't help... but they do. "
Cataract,Symfony results: both eagle vision and microscope vision,"The title of this post is surely an exaggeration but does describe the essense of what I'm experiencing. Bear with me for some background details and then we can get into the interesting result of all this.So, with my Symfony lenses, after 6 months both eyes measure plano 0.0 with a mild .5 astigmatism in the left.This effectively gives my right eye a crisp 20/15 when reading the 10ft distance eye chart, and sharp vision for both computer and reading a pocketbook and even being just able to read the pill bottle at arm's length and measures about J3-J5 which is pretty decent for Symfony results, I think.My left eye is a much fuzzier, but still, 20/20 when reading the 10ft distance eye chart, and barely reads the computer and can't read the pocketbook at arm's length and fluctuates around J8, which is poorer than expected near vision, but still a good result for the wall chart.So, in the doctor's office, my right eye seems all around superior and in line with what I should expect for Symfony results. But I was a bit disappointed and worried about the near distance performance of my left eye and felt there was something wrong with my eye or the lens.However, I just noticed something in the last few days that blew me away... For much LARGER distances encountered in daily life in the outside world and not measured in the doctor's office, say from about 30 feet to infinity, my poorer LEFT eye becomes the superior eye and is absolutely sharper at these much larger distances!I see so well at these distances and was so focused on the doctors measurements that I never really tested to see which eye was actually doing the work at these larger distances - I just assumed it was the right eye since the doctors ""distance"" wall chart said it was slightly better - but the truth is as I look further and further in the distance, the right eye gets fuzzier but the left remains crisp and becomes the go-to eye. It's like my right eye rules from near to out about 25 feet, where both eyes are pretty equal, but a bit further out from there my left takes over and remains crisp all the way to infinity while my right becomes progressively more blurred.I'm not sure this is a good thing and I should be happy or not! In daily life, it does seem my brain is choosing the best image depending upon the distance and the disparity between the two is not really noticeable unless I cover one eye.There's one thing for sure - there seems to be more to the story of assessing your range of vision than what the doctor measures in the small confines of the office. What is measured there at 10ft as ""far distance"" does not seem to carry to infinity and tell the full story.But I don't quite get it... I'm not sure what this all means? Although both eyes are plano 0.0 so technically not nearsighted or farsighted and no eyeglasses will make an improvement - there is no doubt a noticeable difference between them... it seems like the left eye is right at the border of being farsighted and the right eye is at the opposite border of being nearsighted?"

Because of this my doctor won’t clear me for cataract surgery and the eye surgeon is hesitant as well just because she wants to protect herself from a lawsuit etc, even though the risk is minimal/non existent. A retina specialist has examined both of my eyes and cleared me for the surgery. So I guess my doctor and the eye surgeon are just ok with the cataracts getting progressively worse until I am blind. Any suggestions? Please don’t suggest I get my blood sugar under control, that’s not going to happen, I’m not going to give up the foods I love. I am ok with my life span being shortened b/c of the diabetes, but I want to see clearly during the remaining years I have left!"

Cataract,cloudy vision after cataract surgury ,"Immediately after cataract surgery (2 years ago) I had a foggy or cloudy vision and colors are not as vivid as they were. I've never been able to see as good as I did before surgery. The cataracts were not severe, they wanted to do to do so they could put Istents in to get my glaucoma pressure down. They have done the yag surgery, and I have been to several doctors, Duke, Johnson city eye, a doctor from Knoxville and Tn, Kingsport regional eye. Not one of them can find anything wrong.

Cataract,Symfony Multifocal Lens or Regular Lens - looking for Recommendations ,"I will be having cataract surgery soon and am trying to decide on one of the following two options. 1) Right eye regular monovision lens and left eye regular Toric lens, and just correct distance vision; or 2nd Option: right Eye, Symfony Multifocal lens, Left eye, Symfony Toric Multifocal Lens. I had Lasek surgery 11 years ago. It worked well for several years and I did not need glasses. My eyes were very dry after the surgery and it took almost a year to get optimum sight. About 5 years later I started wearing biofocal contacts again. I wore them for about two years and they caused severe dryness again and have been using Restasis and now Xiidra drops. I’d like to hear recommendations and or experience of others who have used both types of lens. Those with regular lens, if you corrected distance only, can you see and read instrument panel in car and cook without glasses. Just interested in results with both types of lens."
Cataract,Mini-monovision target?,"Back on this site again after a detached retina repair (vitrectomy) derailed my plans for cataract surgery a couple of months back. Surgery was on the non-cataract eye, although that eye will now get cataract sooner due to the surgery. An unfortunate side effect, but I still have my vision so I'm thankful.One other consequence of the surgery is that I am no longer a candidate for a Symfony or ReStor lens. As a result I am now strongly considering mini monovision and I'm looking for patient experiences to help guide my decision.My cataract is in my Left eye, which is my dominant one. My plan is to correct to Plano, or close to it, and then wear a contact in my other eye to test out mini monovision. Ideally I was thinking I would go to -1.50 in the Right eye with contacts, but is that too much of a difference? Would I be better off targeting -1.00 with contacts?Some other back on I would be curious if anyone has thoughts on. My measurements in my cataract eye are now -3.50 with -1.0 (180) astigmatism. This I has been -1.50 point five zero with-0.50 astigmatism for 10+ years. When I asked why the astigmatism changed, the Dr I met with said my cornea always had a -1.0 astigmatism, but essentially my natural lens was offsetting it by -0.50. Does that seem reasonable, or is that just talking around the issue? The reason I ask is that he was suggesting limbal relaxation incision (LRI) to help correct the astigmatism, but made no mention of a toric lens option. I am leaning towards getting the LRI, but welcome any feedback on the procedure or what I was told.Let me start by saying I do really like this surgeon a lot, and have heard very good things about him. The one other thing that I heard that didn't make sense to me was that he does not use 0RA for last minute Lens calculations because he said he did for a while and found no difference in his own calculations prior to surgery. All it did was add time and cost, with no improvement in outcome. I had been pretty set on wanting ORA as part of my cataract surgery, but he does not do it unless I am going to pay for the laser surgery which he is not recommending at over $2000 additional cost. BTW, the LRI is $500 more.Back to my original question - welcome real patient experiences with mini monovision and what the two eyes are in terms of refraction. I think it's safe to say we all would love to be free from glasses, but if I can limit them to just extensive reading with this approach, I would be thrilled. If I can read my phone, my tablet, and my computer screen most of the time without any glasses Plus have pretty good distance vision so that I don't need glasses for driving I don't think I could ask for anything more.Thoughts?"
Cataract,Cataract Surgery - How Soon can PCO Develop?,"I had cataract surgery on my left eye about 4 weeks ago, with a Symfony extended depth lens implant. Ever since, and with no improvement so far my vision is blurry, more so at some distances than others but in general overall, there is reduced contrast, and I have what I would categorize as severe starburst / halos at night. Night vision is very blurry. Surgeon says my eye is healing well, lens is perfectly positioned. Is it possible that I could have PCO, or is it too soon?"
Cataract,Piggyback lenses vs Lasik/Lasek/Smile,"As I approach another vitrectomy after having one on each eye combined with IOL, I need to consider correcting my monofocal IOL outcome at the same time. The initial target was a mildly myopic prescription to give some intermediate & arms length vision as I had with my natural lenses. However I now find that vitrectomy and IOL surgery combined makes calculations tricky as eye shape (axial length especially which is key to power) can change for at least a year post surgery.The upshot is my initially under myopic result is moving ever more overly myopic and I am finding contact lenses (multifocal or standard) difficult to wear and get reasonable vision with. I also have very bad starbursts, dysphotopsias and a strange circle around light sources in low light like a Symfony IOL circle but larger, so its not been great all told.My surgeon has suggested piggy back lenses to put the vision back nearer where I wanted as these will avoid worsening comfort issues with contact lenses.Has anyone had piggyback lenses and if so how did it go?"

Cataract,Intraocular lens suggestions,"I am 40 years old, and I found out last year that my worsening vision is due to cataracts. Everything is completely blurred with my left eye, but my right eye is still pretty good. I know soon enough I will have to have surgery. I have never needed glasses and would prefer to not need reading glasses if that option was available, even at an added expense. What types and/or brands of lenses do you recommend? Also, does anybody have any recommendations for eye surgeons in the Baltimore, Maryland area? Thanks!"
Cataract,I had 2 eyes cataract last May and had some problem need help ..,"I have a question for you. In May, I had the cataracts in both of my eyes removed & new lenses put behind my pupils. I’ve had no problems with my left eye but for 2 days my right eye was red & dry with light pressure & some pain. At first I used Blink Eyedrops 4 to 6 times a day & it got better after 2 days. The eye doctor told me that nothing seemed wrong but told me to use AC Soft Lid Cleaner 4 times a day & Blink Eyedrops 4-6 times a day. One week later the problem came back, then went away again. Also I woke at midnight one night with my eye feeling dry & rough so I used the Blink Eyedrops & it was fine. I am wondering what is causing the redness and pressure and why it comes and goes. Has anyone else had this problem? Please let me know!"
Cataract,IOL power meaning please,"My sister had two dense cataracts removed in May and July. The only information she has is a card to give her optician when she visits for prescription glasses for distance about 6 to 8 weeks after the July operationThe first card is for the Right Eye.It says::CT Asphina 409MP (which is a type of IOL lens)ØT = 11.0 Ø body = 6.0Right eye D +23.0The second card is the same exceptLeft eye D: +23.5I was wondering if someone could give me any information on the meaning of those measurements with the limited information available. She wasn't told anything about type of lens or whether it was for distance or near vision. Her previous history was that she didn't need glasses as a child, but over the last 10 to 15 years she needed both distance and reading glasses getting progressively stronger but she doesn't know the strength.. I was unaware that she was almost blind in one eye and the ""good one"" had a permanent smudge in front of it. She thought her clear glass was frosted!The surgeon told her she let her cataracts grow too dense before having them removed. . (I believe it is more difficult to measure for IOL power if cataract is too dense).She was scared after first surgery on right eye because she couldn't read the numbers on the wall clock in a classroom and could only read medium sized print. However she was almost blind before the operation so it was a great improvement on pre-op.But WHAT IF THE OTHER EYE HAD THE SAME RESULT? We both foolishly thought that all cataract operations were a magical process that gave you perfect vision for both near and far!!!! This was a rude awakening! Luckily the other eye was a much better result. She can now drive around quite confidently in her local area and will require prescription glasses to see further into the distance in order to read distant signs. She needs +1 reading glasses to read the paper. Everything is much clearer and colours are sharper than she has seen in years, so she is happy with the outcome considering she left it so late. As I, too, have early stage cataracts, I'm trying to understand what happens."

Cataract,Ive been diagnosed with early cataracts. My vision has been blurred in one eye .,Hi all. Been blurred in one eye intermittently. Just wondering if I need to have it removed now or later on. 
Cataract,Thankful firsts,It is so easy to dwell on the negatives of cataracts and things one misses - particularly if you experience them younger than you ever thought you would. Although I am almost a year out from surgeries I still think about eyesight every day - perhaps it’s not something I will ever take for granted or there will be days where I don’t think about the what ifs still to come. But today is a day to be thankful. Went to my first 3D movie since the surgeries and was completely awestruck with the fact I could put on a pair of 3D glasses on my face that I didn’t have to keep repositioning over another pair of eye glasses. I used to avoid 3D movies - finding the glasses a real distraction.Anyone else struck by new experiences they now find enjoyable glasses free?
Cataract,Monofocal set for distance... what should be my expectations?,"For people who have had cataract surgery with a standard monofocal IOL lens how drastic has your near vision acuity been reduced? I am fully aware that reading glasses is pretty much the guarantee when opting for monofocals that are set for distance... I think I’m okay with that if I go that route but I also hear some people require different strengths to see close up and a bit further out like near-intermediate.... I really do not want to have to have multiple pairs to see for example computer and than a different set to see my smartphone. Is there anybody out there that just really just need one pair of reading glasses to see things in detail near.... and are fine without glasses for the rest of their visual spectrum. I know I do not want progressive or bifocal glasses nor do I want my eyes set for monovision. My surgeon did hint of setting slightly near sighted with monofocals. I guess I might have to wear a different prescription for really good distance if that were the case?Also with monofocal lens how are things like hiking, playing sports, mountain biking, etc..... is it difficult to find footing to see things close that would require me to have to use multifocals contact lens to get by? Although i know things will be generally a lot clearer after my cataract surgery but just wondering how much does it affect your hand eye coordination with monofocals set for distance..... Most experiences I read about people’s results with cataract surgery is that distance is good 20/20 and they usually just need reading glasses to see close in detail... is it really that simple?? "

I spend 8 hours a day in front of a desktop computer, but lately, because of the disabling headaches, I have to stop working or take Ibuprofen 600 mg to get through the day.I believe the straining of my scalp muscles is due to head tilting to see abound clouding of the cataract.I got new computer glasses, mono-focal glasses for distance, and +5 magnifying glasses for reading, no longer using the progressive glasses. The headaches are slightly better but I still need daily ibuprofen.I believed that my headache will resolve if I get cataract surgery, so, I saw an eye surgeon last week, during a very brief visit, she recommended astigmatism correcting lenses.Since the surgeon's attitude towards me was deplorable, never relating to anything I said and never addressing the issue that brought me to her - my headaches, I realize that I have to do my own research on this topic. I found this forum, I have learned a lot from various posts, and I hope to find here the answers to my questions. Did anyone have tension-type headaches from cataract?Did the cataract surgery help the headaches?What would be the best option for IOL to avoid headaches due to head tilt?Is a trifocal IOL a good option since progressive glasses aggravate the Headaches.Can I continue to do computer work during the two-week recovery after each surgery?

Cataract,Symfony lens comparison to naked eye,"As a brief background, I have a Symfony lens implanted in my right (dominant) eye and my God given eyeball on the left side. I'm trying to decide between having another Symfony lens implanted or a standard lens implanted in the other (left) eye, or go for a complete lens exchange. It has been 4-1/2 months since my first eye was worked on.A couple of nights ago, I was in a theater watching an animated film (Ethel & Ernest, which was great). As I was watching the movie, I would occasionally alternately cover one eye and then the other, to see if I could notice any difference in what I was seeing from one eye to the other. I was very surprised to find out that my original eye produced noticeably richer colors and more detail than the Symfony eye. In fact, some of the fine black line work could be seen with my original eye, but wasn't there at all with the Symfony eye. I found this kind of disturbing. (Also, my original eye was seeing sharper than the Symfony eye). My question is: Is the loss of richness and color a by-product of the Symfony lens or could that be what my natural eye would be seeing even if I didn't have an implant? Also, if it is a by-product of the Symfony lens ... if I went for a lens exchange (to a standard lens), could I expect to see the richness and detail come back again (or is it lost forever)? Thank you."
Cataract,Cataract Surgery and Lens Replacement question. ,"I have been diagnosed with a Cataract and Glacoma in my LE that requires surgery. Currently my LE is very nearsighted due to the cataract. My RE sees decent intermediate and good distance so I have have Mono-Vision which I have adapted to naturally. My doctor has ruled out EDF IOL or Multi-Vision lens due to my eyes structure so IOL will need to be my lens of choice. I have never had Lasik or any other surgery on my eyes to this date.Originally I was going to go with the Near sighted lenses for my LE and then later replace the RE with a distance lens so I'd have a full range of vision to allow me to read and drive. But from what I've read from this board it might be better to replace the LE with an Intermediate lens and then use a distance lens in the RE when needed. Just a note, I would be using an intermediate lens in my LE even though it's my dominant eye, but since it's near sighted hopefully it won't matter."
Cataract,An answer to How much will I need readers? ,A big concern of mine pre surgery was how much I’d need readers. I can answer that for those of you who are presurgery and would like to know. My husband has Symfony and I have monovision IOLs. Presurgery I had monovision contacts and he had glasses- progressive lenses.We both hardly need readers during the daytime unless it’s something like a medicine bottle but we find we need them more after dark. I do miss how before I could get a sliver out and use a tweezers and see to shave my legs and armpits with my bare eyes. ( I’d have needed magnification if I had my contacts in).
Cataract,Cataract - I Should Have Chosen Near Vision,"Hello - I hope someone can help me or offer some advice. I recently had a Toric IOL lens put in my Right Eye for distance after removing a cataract about 10 days ago. I had a choice of Near, Mid Range or Distance. My doctor didn't want to chance a multifocal due to my astigmatism and prior history years ago of ""corneal erosion"" (right eye only) which I've been free of the condition for over 10 years. So, we went with a monofocal alcon lens which gives the ""clearest"" vision without risk of halos and other things.The problem is when given the choice of Near, Mid Range or Distance everyone said go with distance. I never really thought this through at all. If I could turn the clock back, I'm quite certain I would have gone with near vision in a heartbeat. I've been nearsighted for over 20 years and I don't mind wearing glasses to look at a computer (mid range) or for driving. I have NOT done (cataract surgery on) my left eye as of yet. The very next day after the surgery I thought I made a big mistake. I kind of feel like my life has been ""on hold"" for the last week and I'm not sure what to do. My left eye is my dominant eye and the cataract is not bad at all yet in that eye. I'm thinking about holding off on doing that eye until I know what I want to do. I just can't imagine always having to wear reading glasses to see things up close. I've been in tears off and on since the surgery. Overall my distance vision is very good and the surgeon did an excellent job. However, I should have carefully thought this through rather than just gone with the hype ""almost everyone chooses distance."" There are so many reasons to choose near vision I keep compiling a list of all the reasons I want my near vision back in my right eye. I'M STUCK. Has ANYONE else gone through this? Will I just get use to this? Should I consider a lens exchange, piggback, laser or something else? My fingers are blurry even as far as 12 inches from my face. How long do I have to wait until my near vision will get as good as it is going to get? Maybe it will get a little better but I do not know. What should I do? Thank you all for your input. "

Cataract,I have a detached retina is cataract surgery still possible?,Hi I have had a detached retina for many years and am completely blind in my left eye. Over the past two months a cataract has developed over that eye and I really want to have it removed. Is my condition going to make cataract surgery impossible? I heard that having preexisting conditions while going into the surgery will cause complications. Any help?

Cataract,Cataract Operation,My husband has just had a Cataract Operation and he is really having difficulty in the evening. His op was a little more complex as he has a distorted cornea. What is happening is when he looks directly into the light he gets a line in the middle of his eye with colours of the rainbow. This is causing him major worry as there is no way he could possibly drive at night due to all the headlights and street lighting. Will this improve or is this as good as it is going to get. 
Cataract,My surgery experience,"I'm the one who wrote for info since I had (still have) the thin retinas, lattice degeneration and holes, astigmatism, and large eyeballs--a perfect storm of problems for any surgeon to face.My lens exchange was just this last Friday. While many others will disagree, I chose to have both eyes done at once. I was originally scheduled last month, but the retina specialist cancelled the surgery because I was at-risk from all of the retina problems. Fortunately, he was able to fit me in for argon laser treatment that same day. I had to wait 4 weeks so that he could confirm that the treatment ""took"" (scars formed that would reinforce the areas that were weak/had holes). I absolutely knew that my luck would mean another treatment, but I was wrong. The specialist said that the treatment had done its job and my surgery could proceed. The only time I felt anything was when the surgeon did a ""marking"" on my eyes. I only felt a slight scratching feeling on one eye. At that point, she added more numbing drops and I never felt a thing afterwards.The surgical team was fantastic and quick. I admit I was scared/nervous, not because I didn't have faith in my doc (she's absolutely amazing), but because I've had so many disappointments over the years when it came to my eyes. They had the sedation line in within seconds, very little pain, the oxygen/something mixture tube in my nostrils and we were off! I don't remember too much, so I think the doc probably told them to take me one step away from being knocked out (worked for me!), but I do remember seeing Chinese dragon heads (??!!) when my left eye was worked on. It was over in a flash and I slept for a bit until it was time to get up and go.On the way home, I remember seeing through a light wall of white, almost as though there were gauze and two circles in the middle when I looked at anything light. I wore the sunglasses, but was amazed that I could read road signs relatively well. It took a couple of days to figure it out, but now I know that the white was the remaining antibiotics that were placed in my eyes. The circles were from the protective clear lenses that the doc placed during surgery and removed the very next day. When she tested my eyes for distance, I couldn't believe it. Every single letter was sharp and clear. Better, I could read every line with no trouble at all. The same was true of the card to test my reading vision. I could read everything with no problems. I don't know how things are measured here (Mexico) but I'm better than 100% for near and far vision. I never had that, even with contacts or glasses.My prescription contacts were -8.0 and -8.5 with one for astigmatism. My IOLs are Zeiss trifocals (one for the astigmatism). It's early days, I know, but boy, I sure wish I'd done this years ago. All of the headaches I had from my contacts, all of the times I had to throw them away because of excessive protein deposits if I'd cried during a sad movie or used the computer a bit too much, etc, etc, could have been avoided.I still keep reaching for my readers and have to remind myself that they're not needed.I'm not writing to crow about my results because it's early days and things happen. I'm writing this because I want others to know that there is hope even for those of us who feel like they're one step away from a dog and dark glasses. "
Cataract,Monovision plan ?,"I have cataracts in both eyes and want monovision. I saw the surgeon again today. He had earlier said he would set the left for distance, and then we’d discuss the right after the left had healed. That made sense but seemed pretty wide open.Today I said, the best case possibility that you’ve outlined – that I’d need glasses for driving, the theater, extended reading, and small print – would be amazing, but I know there is variation. I then asked how the results on the left would affect the decision on the right. He said, you’d tell me what you’re missing – computer, or reading. I asked about the issue of making the eyes too different and he said he’d make the near eye mildly myopic; not too different. I then asked if he thought I’d be able to read my phone (big phone, big font). He then said I would be able to see headlines (as in print), nothing too tiny. I started sharing results of contact trials and he interrupted me and sternly said he can’t get the precision of contact lenses and his concern was that I would never be satisfied. I was stunned but realize how my approach could have made me seem like the patient who wouldn’t be satisfied. I could get few words out thereafter.I asked if it would make sense to undercorrect the left to make room for more close vision in the right; and he said that is unwise; a slippery slope. That made sense to me because you could aim for 20/40 but if you get less, then your distance eye isn’t that helpful uncorrected. I am left uncertain as to what he might aim for on the right, and how conservative he would or would not be in terms of “mild myopia.” Should I know that? He would use Technis monofocals: toric in the left (distance) eye; non-toric in the right. Tecnis lenses may be good for monovision. John R. Wittpenn, Jr. MD used the non-toric monofocal lenses and targeted 0.5 to 1.00 diopters in the near eyes of 26 patients. The patients wound up with good distance and being able to read print; and rarely used glasses. My surgery date is set for tomorrow. If I postpone it would not be until late August. I would appreciate your thoughts and comments. "
Cataract,"Those with monofocals set for distance, how is your intermediate vision?","I've been leaning towards Symfony but I've been told it is not the best option for me overall. I am in the computer IT field which is why intermediate distance is important to me, I would also like to continue to drive safely. Since I already have night vision issues caused by my cataracts/astigmatism, I have already learned to be accustomed to it, so didn't think it would be a huge deal to me. I also never wore glasses so it would be a big lifestyle change for me, I tried to wear glasses for like the past 1.5 months and still not getting used to it..However on my left eye, since I have astigmatism that is slightly irregular (2.5D's worth), and also (the bigger issue) had an episode of CSR (central serous) that left me with some central vision distortion are the reasons why I am being suggested to go with monofocals.I am going with a Toric, but I heard torics are hard to do a lens exchange with so this decision is very important..So those with monofocals set for distance, how is your intermediate (computer) vision? Your visual acuity without glasses?Thank you, also to those who have answered my previous discussions"

He is suggesting to go with Symfony lens... but after reading the above experiences I am really worried... I am ok to set for distance vision and wear glasses for reading... but having halos and wont be able to drive more difficult.. can you guys provide your suggestion what to do in this ? I am going to discuss with my surgeon again on the options... but please throw your thoughts [sad] .... I just want my vision back.. Please note that I am a software engineer and work on computer whole day... please please respond ... also if not symfony is it better to set lens for near/intermedite and far ?? please waiting for your replys.. really worried ;"
Cataract,Over Corrected REDO surgery? ,"My eyes were over corrected from glasses( -5.0 R and -4.25 L; +2.25 for progressive, no astigmatism,) with a single +13.0 single vision standard technis abbott lens. (Seems strange to have same Rx lens despite never being same for past 50 years?) Post op - I was over corrected as now I need a +.5 in both eye glasses for distance and a +2.5 for reading. Overcorrection sucks as it reduced mid range vision as well and forces stronger readers, which distort more. Also as we age I believe the eye ball can change (smaller) thus making the need for even stronger + scripts for glasses. Bottom line....surgery was one month ago....should I redo with better lens implants?? I am considering a redo with ORA performed. Prior to surgery, I was never told about LACS or ORA by 2 drs. Found out about ORA and LACS at this site...thanks but wish it has been before. "
Cataract,Dr did not even bring up that there were a number of lens choices,"Dr did not even bring up anything but a distance lens during the ""visit"". I called and the clinic director said that the distance (mono) lens was what I was getting after she looked at my records so she talked with the Dr later and she confirmed that was what I was eligible for. Medicare is paying but I have extra money to make this surgery exactly what I want. Again, why not have the doc call me to tell me how she came to her conclusion. I had 20/20 when younger then presbyopia started and later the cataracts. I got the feeling this was an ""eye mill"". Summit Eye Associated in Nashville. I am SO getting a second opinion.

Cataract,Not sure whether to go for lens replacement!,I had laser surgery 10 years ago to correct short sightedness (I was - 4.50 and -4.25 ). I realised I would need to wear reading glasses following the surgery as I wanted the best possible distance vision I could. Surgery was brilliant and I knew straight away it was successful. 10 years on and I'm wondering whether to try and be free of reading glasses and today had an eye test and currently have some contact lenses in which are + .5 left eye and +1.00 in the right. They are multifocal lenses and are taking some getting used to. I have an appointment next week with the eye clinic to look at lens replacement but I'm very nervous having read some of the reviews here and not sure whether I'm expecting too much from any possible procedure. Maybe I should leave well alone but reading glasses are starting to frustrate me. Thought I would try to contact lens trial just to see how I get on but it is day 1 so I should probably persevere. Any suggestions thoughts - anything gratefully received. Thanks.I had laser surgery 10 years ago to correct short sightedness (I was - 4.50 and -4.25 ).

Cataract,Blurred vision and shadows after lens replacement,i had lens replacement surgery a week ago. Before surgery my distance vision was very good but I couldn't read a thing without glasses. Since surgery I can read the smallest of print but can't see further than a couple of metres before everything goes out of focus. I also have a shadow at the corner of both eyes so feel like I'm wearing blinkers. Has anyone had the same experience and if so does it improve at all without the need for further surgery. Any advice appreciated. 
Cataract,Equipment for measuring eye for cataract after having lasik,"I saw a doctor for cataract surgery.

Cataract,Iol exchange after cataract surgery miscalculation ,"I’m a previous lasik patient. (2001 corrected far vision). I had cataract surgery in right eye 12/23/2017 and left eye the following week. Immediately the right eye was a problem, and we continued on with second procedure because the dr said he knew what to do to correct the issue.I had iol exchange 4/26/2018 in right eye. Yesterday I had my 2 week follow up. I am currently on durezol steroid drop and over the counter dry eye drops. There is still daily fluctuations and I am not reading 20/20 more like 20/40 and blurry. Lasik enhancement has always been a follow up option. During exchange surgery, which took much longer than expected, my cornea started to dry out, removal of iol was difficult. I could see all the tools needed ( and started to feel fearful of pain as I could start to feel pressure). The Ora machine was used and once again calculations were off. Luckily the dr marked where the toric lens was previously placed in the eye, because the Ora was giving him a new markings that didn’t make sense. He stepped away from the table to consult my chart and decided to go up 1.5 instead of what we thought was a solid 1.0. Previous iol: restor multifocal toric 20.5D 1.5 cyl +2.5 add power new iol: restor multifocal toric 22.0D 1.5 cyl 2.5 add powerDuring yesterday’s follow up dr said yag would be our next procedure as cloudiness on back of lens is forming. Again, this was expected due to now my 3rd operation in that eye. Yag will be done @ 3 month mark then we will consult with lasik or PRK to tune in @ 2 weeks following yag. Also eye pressure was 25 when normally 12 -13 dr said that’s from the durezol. When I inquired about the left eye 20/50 (which now has 1.25 astigmatism) dr said he’d rather see me have lasik to correct because the iol exchange was so tramatic. My personal opinion here and still some raw emotions: 3 months from now I will be consulting yet another opinion on iol exchange in left eye. There is no reason to have that large of astigmatism after surgery when I had zero before. @.50 astigmatism is calculated for such a surgery. Also, my second opinion showed a “ mild tilt” in the lens position. And I believe that was caused during a horrific reaction to stepping down dosage from pregnozone drops. The change to durezol drops has cured that problem for now. My hopes are that the astigmatism and visual accuracy will be restored with lasik or PRK and not another iol exchange. But if an iol exchange is needed, I will go to another dr with much more experience and confidence. My dr has experience in cataract surgery, but has done very few exchanges. I am able to write this review without glasses, but things are not clear. Also where I once had a depth perception issue, that seems to be resolved. ( I get on and off a boat daily, and that has been a challenge seeing how far away I have to step, luckily the preception was things were farther away and I didn’t stub a toe. Haha) . I return to the dr in one month and hopefully things in right eye will settle down and 20/20 vision will appear. Unfortunately it’s just too early to tell how close I will be at this point in time. But it’s a lot better than what I had I’m grateful for the exchange, but obviously had hoped for a clearer outcome. I’m also grateful for not having any residual pain other than a few days of tenderness at the incision. I hope my results are able to help the next generation of surgeons and previous lasik patients in finding the correct lens the first time. "
Cataract,Understanding pre IOL prescriptions better,"I'd miss a name or 2 if I tried to thank all of those who have provided insight directly to my questions, or who have shared personal experiences that have helped me understand my options better so i will just start by say Thank You to all that contribute here.I'm trying to better understand what pre IOL implant refractive prescriptions might mean for outcomes, or even if there is a high correlation. For example, if someone had a -3.5D prescription, would that patient be able to theoretically see near and far with something like a Symfony or ReSTOR 2.5D lens, or is there a limit to the range? My sense is that there is a limit, but for anyone that knows, please share.Quick background for those who haven't seen my 'story' here. I'm 51yo male who had a long standing stable RX for 10-15+ yrs, until the past year when my LE (dominant) vision went downhill fast. Long story short, a nuclear cataract was discovered, and that now has my LE vision estimated to be approximately -3.75D. Previously I was LE -1.50 -0.50 160 and RE was/is -2.00 -0.50 180. I was able to read comfortably by lifting up my glasses pre-cataract. LE is now just too blurry to read, but can read just fine with RE.My thought is that the reflective depth of my eye is still the 'old RX', meaning that I'm only -3.75 because of a really cloudy lens. My first consult recommended a monofocal IOL undercorrected to 0.50-0.75D, which, if I understand correctly, would make me approximately 20/40 in my Left dominant eye. I've read that the dominant eye should generally be corrected for best distance vision. I'm also still weighing whether a Symfony IOL would make more sense since I should (hopefully) have it for 30+yrs.Some of my questions for the group are: - Is it not a good idea to get a dominant eye undercorrected for Plano? - Am I correct that my long standing pre-cataract RX of -1.5D more relevant than the current -3.75D with the cataract?- If the -1.5D is more relevant, has anyone, either from reading or from personal experience found better (or worse) outcomes with a Symfony (or ReSTOR 2.5D)?- From what I've read, even with a monofocal IOL, I'm strongly considering the laser approach with ORA, as I've come to believe the best outcome will be achieved, but interested in what others think on this as well.I know that some of these questions should first be prefaced with what my outcome goal would be, and what my lifestyle is. Utopia is eliminating glasses, which in the short term would mean a contact in my RE until that needs cataract surgery in the next 5-10yrs. Absent that, in today's world, I use my smartphone & tablet frequently for work & leisure, and do a fair amount of computer work, mostly on a 24"" monitor. I also do drive some long distances for work (3-4hrs) so it would be ideal to comfortably see my dashboard as well as having good distance vision for driving of course. I do recognize that more precise measurements will be taken prior to surgery, and that will dictate what my focal depth is. I have 2 (maybe 3) cataract surgical evaluations coming up in July and plan to ask these questions, but responses here definitely help me ask better questions, so thanks in advance for comments and suggestions."
Cataract,Post-op vision worse than pre-op vision 2 months after cataract surgery. Need help!!!,"I hope the community can help me here… I am a 49 year old male that just underwent cataract surgery for both eyes 2 months ago, and now am currently experiencing worse vision than before my cataract surgeries (I was 20/40 pre-op in both eyes and am worse than 20/60 in both eyes now. My history is as follows: Had Lasik (and a touch up a month later) 20 years ago and unfortunately was not able to get these records from that doctor since my records were long since destroyed. Currently posterior chamber intraocular lenses are both with mild central posterior capsular plaque, and I also have severe dry eyes. Everything else is OK. My doctor has recommended YAG laser to clear the plaques, and thinks that it may be the plaques that are causing my horrible post-op vision, but I am hesitant as I understand it may be difficult to change my IOL later on if I have the YAG laser treatment. I also wonder if the doctor maybe put in the wrong power lenses? Doctor has ‘concluded’ that I will need glasses/another Lasik procedure done to correct my vision rather than him trying to re-calculate the Toric placements or try a different lens and is trying to scare me with all the risks by going back into the operating room...blah..blah..blah. But why would I want glasses or Lasik when I have paid for the premium lenses? And how in the heck is it possible that my vision is still actually worse after surgery 2 months later? This makes no sense to me! I wonder if DMO doctors get into trouble (or get pressured) into not going back to the surgery room with patients (for costs)? I honestly am not looking for 20/20 vision correction, heck I would be happy with 20/30!Below is a break down what my exams showed:I had Acrysoft IQ torics put in both eyes with the power 18.5D/1.50CYLDay 1, post-op exam for left eye:20/25-2 with no pinhole test done at this time (At this time I was happy and thought that it was a successful surgery for being the day after for this eye)(pre-op was 20/40, no pinhole test done at this time either)1 month post-op exam for left eye: 20/60-1 with pinhole at 20/25-1 (Yikes! What happened here?) Day 1, post-op exam for right eye:20/50 -1 (pre-op was 20/40 with pinhole at 20/30-2) Uh Oh, not nearly where I was with the left eye at 1 day post op.1 month post-op exam for right eye:20/60 with pinhole at 20/30 (Ugh!) My current manifest refraction:Right -1.00 (sphere) Cylinder -.075Left -0.75 (sphere) Cylinder -.050 I am going to get a second opinion to see what a different doctor says before I try the YAG laser to clear up my plaques…..sigh…I’m just beyond broken here….any help or insight given is much appreciated! And if able I will post info from second opinion Doctor on this."
Cataract,Post cataract operation ,"I am 2 years post cataract operation, my vision is blurry now I wonder if any one has the same problem and how to fix it"
Cataract,Choosing Intermediate/Near Monofocal Cataract Lens -- My (Positive) Experience So Far,"I’ve had mild to moderate myopia since high school (approx -1.75 diopters; no significant astigmatism). I have always worn glasses for distance, but have generally not worn any correction otherwise. After age 50 I really started to appreciate my myopia, as I observed all my friends and husband struggle with multiple sets of reading glasses. All I had to do was to remove my glasses to see up close. To me it was not much of an inconvenience to wear distance correction, as in many of the situations where I really needed correction (daytime driving, hiking, biking, etc.) I would choose to wear protective sunglasses anyway (hence, I always have had Rx sunglasses).At age 56 I was diagnosed with a cataract in my right eye, that was causing halos and blurry vision; especially at night. I was very apprehensive about surgery, since my left eye had a retinal tear about a year earlier. For two years, the vision in the cataract eye continued to get worse, and night driving more and more problematic. Further, a small cataract had started to develop in my left eye.In considering lens options, I was not a candidate for a multi-focal lens. Given the potential for halos, etc., I would not select this option even if I were a candidate. That left monofocal lenses, which required me to select which distance I would prefer to have my best vision without glasses. After much consideration, I concluded I would definitely not want to be corrected to 20/20, as that would leave me unable to see up close as I was accustomed to. The thought of picking up a newspaper, book, menu, or smartphone and not being able to see it was extremely disturbing. Applying makeup would also be problematic. Somewhat troubling to me was that in talking to dozens of friends, acquaintances, and family members, I could not find even one person who had deliberately selected a near-sighted target (though a few had selected monovision or multi-focal lenses). I discussed this concern with my surgeon, and she assured me that some patients do get near-sighted correction and are very happy with it. I had to take her word for it.We opted for a -1.39 diopter target (the odd numbers are based on individual biometry). I figured that would be slightly better than my other eye, and give me fairly good close to intermediate vision.I am two days post-op and couldn’t be more thrilled with the result. My phone, computer, and sheet music are crystal clear, and I am able to read every size font in the newspaper. Most surprising is that my range of vision is far greater than I expected. As of yesterday, my vision in the surgical eye (20/40) would technically allow me to pass a driving test without glasses (good to know in case of emergency). I realize it can take a few weeks for things to stabilize, but so far I am confident I made the best decision. In a few weeks I will get a new prescription for distance, and expect there will likely be occasions that I need magnification for very fine print.Bottom line: If you are getting monofocal cataract lens implant(s), carefully consider your lifestyle and needs before surgery. Take note over several days or weeks of how often you urgently need to see far away, vs. how often you urgently need to see up close. Many people are seduced into a 20/20 distance correction in hopes of “getting rid” of their glasses, only to find they have to trade them in for readers. Although monovision is also an option, consider that you can always attain temporary/reversible monovision by using one contact lens, when desired, if you decide to keep both eyes slighty myopic. That way, you are not permanently left with asymmetrical vision.In my opinion, needing glasses to drive is far less inconvenient than needing glasses every time I need to see up close. For my lifestyle, a target between -1 and -2.0 seems to offer the best “glasses-free” vision range. I hope this is helpful to those of you considering what type of correction is best, especially if you are accustomed to being myopic. "
Cataract,Monovision cataract surgery - results?,"If you’ve had cataract surgery with monovision and monofocal lenses, what were your results like? **What diopters did each eye wind up at? (if you know)**And when do you need to use glasses? Smart phone – computer – small vs. large print – driving? Thank you."
Cataract,Acceptable Symfony result?,"I had Symfony IOL's implanted 4 months ago. In the marketing literature, they show people using their smartphones and lead a person to expect near vision results to match that. Numbers-wise they advertise 20/25 or better through 26 inches.In my one eye which was -6.0 with .-0.75 astigmatism preop, I now have 20/20 at distance (but barely as it's fuzzy) and the doctor says I am plano, but I CANNOT see a Smartphone well enough to use even held at arm's length.The doctor says I have an excellent outcome and suggests a YAG to 'crisp' things up (I'm not convinced it would help as I have no cloudiness at all)So, my question is, should I accept this result? I'm thinking that for the high cost I should get a better result than this considering the advertising shows people using Smartphones?PS> my other eye is is a bit better as I can see as close as about 20 inches to use the Smartphone before it gets too fuzzy, although I must admit I was expecting better.Thanks for any thoughts"
Cataract,Anyone else with lattice degeneration/thin retinas that HAS had cataract surgery?,"OK, I've made a few comments and been mainly lurking for the last few weeks, so now it's time for me to expose (ha ha) myself and ask for your experiences. Please accept my apologies in advance if this turns into a novel.I've worn contacts since I was 16 and I'm 60 now. My eyes have always been crappy, but correctable, but now it's just getting to be too much. When ""X"" surgery (can't remember what it was called, but it was in the early 80's) first came into vogue, I wanted to have it done. I was rejected because as the doctor explained, I'd have to have too many cuts in the cornea to fix my vision and it was too dangerous. I was lucky because a woman I met a couple of years ago had had it done and they'd made 32 (!) cuts in each eye. She said that her vision was amazing...at first, but now the corneas are ""buckling"" and that she has to wear hard lenses to try to keep their form. She has an incredible doc, but there is a very real possibility that she's going to lose her sight. So, while I was sad at the time, I'm grateful that my doc wasn't as mercenary as hers must have been.Then, PRK and Lasik came into play and I went in for a consult. Again, I was denied because too much of the cornea would have had to have been shaved down to achieve any decent result. Again, I was disappointed, but grateful that at least I could wear contacts.When I retired and moved to Mexico, I found some great eye care specialists and continued using contacts. A few years back, when I went for a lens renewal prescription, the doc seemed like I was taking up too much of his time (I had an appointment!) and just mentioned to me that I had ""thin retinas"" as I was leaving. He made it sound like he'd just said I was, ""Unclean!"" ""Unclean!"" Not once did he mention that this was something I needed to be concerned about or that I needed to take extra care in my daily life. So, I went on with my life, continued to ride my bicycle on the sometimes-rather-hairy roads of Mexico and didn't think twice about it--not even when I was sent flying 20 or so yards when a passenger bus hit me from behind in a 4 vehicle accident.Had I known about the risks of sudden movement to the retinas, which I think a bus hitting you in the ass on a bike qualifies as being, I would have been in the eye docs office so fast.So...what has that long, boring life story got to do with anything and why the heck won't I get to the point? Thanks for your patience! Here it is: my eyes are crappy, but mostly correctable. I have -8.0 w/astigmatism in the left (and some cataracts) and -8.5 in the right. When hubby got his cataract surgery a couple of months ago, it went like he was the poster child for the surgery. I've been having some focusing issues with the contacts, my prescription was about to be renewed, and I'd finally had enough. The doc did the usual exam and I was scheduled to have the surgery last month. Well, before you go in, you have to be cleared by the retina specialist. I wasn't. Turns out that the full extent of my ""Unclean!"" ""Unclean!"" thin retinas was actually lattice degeneration and holes, PLUS thin retinas in the left eye but ""only"" thin retinas in the right. The specialist stopped the pending surgery and I opted to follow his recommendation and have Argon laser treatment on my eyes (omg that wasn't fun). The laser promotes scar tissue around the holes and lattice degeneration so that the thin retinas will be a bit stronger/attached. It doesn't cure anything, but it gives me a fighting chance not to have further damage or retinal detachment during the surgery.The reason I'm opting for cataract/lens replacement surgery is that I honestly believe that if I wait until the cataracts are truly vision-impairing, it might be too late. Right now, my eyes are as healthy as they're ever going to be. So, while I'm scared spitless, I know I don't have a choice.I would love to hear of any experiences of other high myopics w/thin retinas and/or lattice degeneration had during their cataract surgery. If you also had laser treatment, that's a bonus. My biggest fear in life (other than loss of family, of course) has always been the loss of vision. Take away my hearing, sense of smell, taste, etc, but please leave me my vision!Encouragement would really be appreciated. "
Cataract,MSM eye drops,Has anyone else used MSM eye drops to get rid of squiggly worm looking eye floaters... not the tiny black dot ones. Mine look like crystal squiggly worms in different shapes and sizes! Wish I never heard of RESTOR lens ?? I didn’t ask for them was told they were the best by the doctor that did my cateract surgery!! I’m so sad! 
Cataract,Crystal clear squiggly worm like eye floaters,For about 2 months I’ve been seeing crystal clear squiggly worm looking floaters moving across my vision. Had cateract surgery last August 2 and 23. Had Restor lens put in. Have been on this forum talking about other problems before. Got lots of good advice.also had a Chalazion removed today. Just wondering if there is a special eye drop for these wormy like floaters . Will it just take more time for all to go away ? Thanks for anyone that might know! 
Cataract,Been seeing black spider Webb images after cateract surgery,Hi has anyone seen black spider Webb effect after cateract surgery? I seen themas the doctor did my left eye 8-23-17. Doctor says it’s normal etc. been using ketorolac drops . Had my right done 8-2-17. Now as of about last 2 weeks I see them over and at right side of my right eye 
Cataract,just had cataract procedure,"Cataracts typically form in ones forties but are not usually significant. Its not until ones sixties that they may begin to cause vision problems. But, with a history of eye complications, it was of no surprise that I began to form cataracts earlier than most. At the age of 56, with a large cataract in my right eye, I was advised to have it removed.As I learned, when a cataract is removed, the lens of the eye is also removed and replaced with an IOL lens (Intra Ocular Lens). Sounds straightforward enough, even though the thought of doing so is anxiety provoking.In the process of being seen, having my eyes scanned and ultrasounded for measurements, and after seeing numerous professionals (opthalmologists, optometrists and eye surgeons), I learnt that I had a long way towards understanding all that I needed to know to make an intelligent decision about my sight.What I learnt was that because I am very near sighted and have astigmatism, that a toric lens was recommended for me (this cost almost 600.00 more than what OHIP pays for a standard IOL), but I was willing to pay to correct the astigmatism.I also learnt that I am not a candidate for a multi focal IOL, meaning that I could not have an IOL that matches the script of the lenses in the frame of my glasses. I was therefore not going to be able to see both up close and far without glasses but had to make a decision to correct my vision so that I had either near vision clarity or distance clarity.My surgeon told me that most people correct for distance. I learnt that although this is the default for most people, it may not be best for me. In fact, my opthalmologist who has been my eye doctor for over forty years and diagnosed my symptomless detached retina when I was 18, recommended against correcting for far because I have been near sighted all my life and not being able to see within close range would be very difficult to adjust to.I began searching online for chat groups and reading posts from people going through this most frustrating and exhausting process.I learnt that I was not alone in getting different advise and unclear direction from specialists.I felt relieved to know that I was not the only one confused by trying to figure out how my vision would be affected if I corrected to a -1.5, -1 or -2 versus -6.5, to name just some of the many numbers that were thrown at me, along with cylinder numerals and axis numerals. It made my head spin. Every time I tried to make sense of it all, I became even more confused.Specialists have very little time to answer questions to incredibly important questions. While the procedure may be very common and part of their everyday work responsibilites, the implications of me requesting what I wanted (yes, it was left up to me) were huge. My final decision could make the difference between me walking around dizzy versus continuing to enjoy my life with relatively good vision.Furthermore, aside from having to decide on near versus far clarity, I was also told that I could consider mono vision or even micro mono vision. Meaning that I could correct my ""dominant"" eye for distance and my non dominant eye for up close. For some, apparently, this means being able to use each eye for different distances. But for others, might mean a life of regretting the decision after not being able to adjust.After repeated visits to my optometrist, I was able to get two contact lenses - one to simulate close and the other for far vision so that I could get a sense of how things might ""look"" after the procedure. This was very helpful in determining that my opthalmologist was right - near was my preference.I had the procedure four days ago. I knew I was in capable hands so the procedure itself was not as anxiety provoking as the outcome.I chose not to be sedated, even though surgeons say that it is best. I knew that I could manage without it.The procedure is quite miraculous and fascinating. It was not painful, just strange feeling.After, I wore my prescription glasses over the operated eye and have continued to do so because removing the lens in the right side of my glasses frame males it really challenging to see (glasses make everything smaller and trying to adjust to two different sizes out of each lens is impossible).when I remove my glasses and cover my left eye, I can see that I am improving daily. since there is a lot of internal swelling, best vision is not expected to be observed until about four weeks time.And then it will be time to remove the small cataract out of the other eye and replace the lens there too. I am thinking that I will likely ask for the same script of lens (-1.5) in that eye too. Bottom line is that when it comes to your eyes, dont be afraid to be considered a ""difficult"" patient just because youre wanting answers to your questions. If the surgeon doesnt have the time or patience to explain everything, find someone who will. Your eyes are worth it...."
Cataract,I had hoped to see betterbthan before,"I am about 3 week’s post op on my 2nd eye ( monovision, same as my contacts had been). I didn’t have cloudiness before surgery- they just could no longer correct me better than 20/40. I did measure 20/32 at my 1 week post op visit but it seems to me I see no better than before the surgery.Guess I should be glad I see no worse, as some do in these forums. And I suppose the advantage is I no longer need contacts either. "
Cataract,How long should vision continue to improve?,"How long will vision continue to improve?At 1 day post op my far vision was 20/50, at 1 week 20/32. I am 2 weeks post op now on 2nd eye and I hope it improves.I measured J2 for near but I noticed at night in the dark before I go to sleep I have trouble on my phone.I had a lot of floaters both times about 3 days post op, and this time at 1 1/2 weeks post op was seeing flashes of light in my peripheral vision."
Cataract,53 yo seeking guidance.,"Hi. I'm 53 and recently diagnosed with a cataract in my right eye. The left lens is clear. I just stumbled into this forum which is a wealth of knowledge. I've got a follow-up appointment in a couple days, so I'm trying to quickly get up to speed on a few things. Current prescription: OD sph -3, cyl -1.25, axis 135. OS -3, -0.25, 150. I'm trying to think through the best options. I currently wear glasses; contacts years back gave me some dry eye issues, but I haven't tried them in many years. I'd like to reduce dependence on glasses as much as I can. But since I'm only having one eye done, it sounds like that's not too likely. I work with computers every day, so good vision in that range is important. I already deal with some halos at night. Can someone give me some starting points in what I should be considering for a lens option? Has anyone combined cataract surgery in one eye with Lasik in the other?Thanks in advance for your thoughts on my scenario.RichB"
Cataract,Pilocarpine drops or Suture the pupil,"I have larger than normal pupils (6-7 mm) in one eye. Because of this, my vision is not as sharp as it should be. For diagnostic and informative reasons, my doctor prescribed me low dose oral Pilocarpine 1%, twice a day to see if they would induce miosis (shrink/constrict the pupil). If it does, then he suggested two options: (1) Continue taking Pilocarpine once or twice a day, indefinitely or (2) Explore long term option of suturing the pupil to a smaller size.I've read that Pilocarpine does not have serious side effects. Low doses are even prescribed by pediatric doctors to children two and younger. My doctor said higher concentration (like 4%) of it induces brow ache but lower doses should not/do not. The first day I started Pilocarpine, I experienced mild brow ache and heavy eyelid. Second day was less. Third day onwards, none. It's been seven days today.I'm edgy with the thought of suturing the pupil to constrict it. After all, it is a procedure and carries a certain amount of risk, both during and afterwards. For one, pupil dilation will be restricted afterwards.I would like to ask the community here, if patients have had good or bad experiences with Pilocarpine drops. How long have you been using it and has it improved your overall vision to the point that you are happy using the drops indefinitely?Also, has anyone had a pupil constriction procedure with sutures? Are there risks associated with it? Are you happy with your visual outcome after the procedure?"
Cataract,Catarac problems,Ok so I had catarac surgery both eyes in October 2017. Yag on both in January do to film on eyes.

Cataract,Contrast reduction with the Tecnis Symfony lens in non cataract eyes,Question .I am looking for comments on how much the Symfony lens has reduced contrast in non cataract eyes.I am planning to have bilateral Symfony lenses with my non dominant left eye done first with a 0.5 correction for near reading.Then the second right eye with no near correction a month or two later adjusting for the results from my left eye.I am 49 and i do not have cataracts or drive much at night and my prescription isR +3.25 -0.75x95L +4.50 -0.5x45I DO NOT want to wear glasses for mobile phones or distance golf etc but would for an occasional intricate hobby.How much contrast reduction as a percentage has been experienced?I have been editing a picture using Microsoft Office picture manager and reducing the contrast by percentages and up to about 15-20% would be acceptable to me.I look forward to any comments.
Cataract,How many weeks in-between surgeries?,"I saw this post in these forums-Here in Canada the wait time between surgeries for cataracts is 4 weeks - 6 weeks apart. The surgeons want to know where first eye ends up so they can make adjustments to the target of second eye.Sounds good, but in the 5 weeks inbetween my surgeries I think the first eye that was done was only checked 1 day and 1 week after surgery. Usually you have a 1 month check but I didn't on that first eye. It was checked the day after my 2nd eye surgery , so 5 weeks from the first surgery. I was supposed to have them 2 weeks apart but had to reschedule due to a bad cough. Still, if I'd had it done 2 weeks after the first , as planned , they wouldn't really have known yet where the first eye ""ended up."" to be able to make adjustments. I'm guessing they usually see changes/improvements in the month post-op visit from the 1 week post-op visit . I have no problems with mine but I think I'd advise others to wait 5 or 6 weeks in-between surgeries. However I do understand that some have trouble during that in-between time. I found I could wear one contact and be okay , but when I tried my glasses (one lens had been replaced with clear glass) it was very disorienting. I think it was because my first eye done was done for near vision, the contact Ii had in my 2nd eye was for far vision, but my glasses were multifocals."
Cataract,Post Cataract - seeing edge of lense and cresent,"friendsI had cataract surgery 4 days ago in right eye. it was uneventful. Recovery is underway.i noticed if I look straight, off the periphery, i can see a thin vertical line most likely edge of lense. On the right of it there is a hazy area. It looks like a cresent shape which varies depending on where i look. If I put the hand there, i can get between haziness and double images.In reading through the forums, there are references to negative dysphotopsia to lense not be centered. I recall during the operation, the surgeon mentioned that there was scaring as the cataract was more dense than he thought.It is really driving me insane. I had massive ordeal in the same eye 10 years ago with retinal tear and vitrectomy. And now this; i assumed this would be a routine operation and now the uncertainty of what this is.I believe the lense was MX60."
Cataract,OptiEdge iol design and edge-glare,"Hello!I would love to hear from people who had implanted an intraocular lens with optiedge design (sloped, rounded anterior edge) if they see edge-glare, arcs, side flickering and other annoying disturbances? The lens with optiedge are Tecnis silicone and hydrophobic acrylic, sensar AR40e and Clariflex. "
Cataract,Color changes after cataract surgery,"I chose monofocal IOLs for my surgery, one for near and one for far. The near was done first , 5 weeks ago (in my non-dominant eye) because that had the worse cataract. The other was done 3 days ago.I am generally pleased-my near vision is at J2 and my far vision (in the newly done eye) the day after surgery was only 20/50 but he said it would improve. I was surprised it was that bad since I wasn't seeing blurry and felt fine to drive to my appt. I suppose I was seeing better than 20/50 with both eyes together. Seems odd since one is set for near vision but that appears to be the case. I noticed something odd today though. Looking at a friend , her hair looked a different color than what I knew it to be from before. She has short gray hair and all the ends looked tipped in yellow. It's a minor thing but has anyone else experienced anything like this?"
Cataract,Blurred vision after cataracts surgery,My husband had laser treatment in 2003 in both eyes because he hates wearing glasses. Last year he had to have cataracts removed from both eyes and this has left him with blurred vision and the need to wear glasses all the time. He feels it has been a total failure and is very depressed about it. He is 75 years young and very active. He has been to the opticians and they said this was normal! Is this right? Any ideas? Many thanksDiane
Cataract,Trying to decide on multifocal or monovision IOLs,"I had pretty much decided to get the Symfony multifocal. My husband likes his. I have had monovision contacts for almost 20 years and had no trouble adjusting. But it just seems to me if both eyes are working together it’s got to be better. Then the doctor told me in my case it’s a toss-up or maybe 51% in favor of monovision. What is making me re-think this is that my dad had macular degeneration. The tech sent me this email-A family history of ARMD is something we like to take into account. Having family history increases your risk of developing macular degenration (though doesn't guarantee it). In folks that have macular degenration we typically advise against getting the multifocal as the quality will likely be limited. In people who have no sign of macular degenration at the moment (such as yourself), we are certainly ok with people pursuing the multifocal. However, if you wanted to pursue the most conservative approach, pursuing monovision would over the multifocal would likely be a better option if you were to develop macular degenration later in life.Do I am really having trouble deciding.

Cataract,Near vision after surgery,"How is your near vision after cataract surgery? I know those who get IOLs for distance have to use readers, but I’m asking those who have Symfony or mono vision. I chose mono vision. I asked the doctor what it should be for near vision . He said it’s measured on a J scale 1-2-3...10. I am a two. One is best ; with surgery they aim for a three .I can see good at arm’s length (22”) and even closer - about 14”.I’m not sure if that will change when I get my other eye done for distance. "
Cataract,Cataract,"So I had been having issues with my eyesight for a few years. One eye decided to go short sighted while the other wanted to be long sighted. But the last few weeks I had started to notice a sort of orb of light constantly in my field of vision. Kind of like when u look at the light for a bit then look away. So I went to see my optician 2 days ago, and she determined it was very usual, but I have a cataract in my left eye (I am 29 which made it unusual). When it comes to night time I dread it the most as I can’t do anything as I can’t see. I can’t read (I love reading it was my escape) I can’t do my puzzle books, can’t play games. I’m frustrated but as I am already undergoing hospital tests for some undisclosed stomach issues and I have an anxiety disorder, I don’t know if i should just go and have this surgery done. I would like to know what the surgery entails. I know they remove the bad lens and insert a false one. But I’m nervous as to where the anaesthetic is injected. Do they stick the needle in your eyeball? Very freaked out "
Cataract,Symfony Type and Number & Pre-cataract Prescription,"Can you share your pre-cataract correction prescription and the Symfony lens type that was implanted?Thanks,Aniket"
Cataract,I am the one who did not know whether to have treatment in France or in England,"I chose France and had my right eye done two days ago. I am taking it very steady, it seems healthy enough. As for vision, is it too early to say? I had SPH -16.00, CYL -100, axis 180.The implant is ZCT225 13mm 6mm diopter +09.0D SE2.25 CYLDoes this mean anything to anyone?The foggyness as largely clearedThe focus - well I can about read this computer screen, which is obviously better than before, beyond that it is blurry (closer it is blurry too)I tried on my daughter's glasses which are approx 2.5+ and all was a lot betterI am due to see my surgeon again in 5 days to check on this eye, and to have the other eye done - the same presumablyDo you think this is the best outcome for someone with such a big shortfall in natural vision - my French surgeon says I am at -18, it is a lot to correct in one go it seems.I started with glasses at age 6, and cataracts recently, which I was not aware of - but which my surgeon was keen to act upon in France. In the UK they would have to be a lot worse before it was a free operation.The French hospital I went to has a terrific reputation for eyes and it was very busy. My doctor looks like a cross between Roger Federer and Colin Firth when he was Mr Darcy. (perish the thought). Most of the other patients on Friday were French men a lot older than me (I am 52). It was a good ambience. Whilst waiting on the trolley and undergoing our dilation drops and getting anaethsetised (?) - we were several in the pre-theatre waiting room - by this stage I couldn't see much as they had taken away all glasses and false teeth and stuff, and all I could make out were several bright blue (paper pyjama'd) bodies on trollies - one of them set off singing, some old military song with a rousing chorus of Napoleon! Napoleon! The nurses were crying with laughter. Then we peeled off into different operating theatres, there were several surgeons on the go I gather. I didn't see mine but was aware of him behind my head. They taped paper or something over most of my face leaving the right eye, which was presumably stuck open, but comfortable, they must have put some lubricant in - but I did find the bright light unpleasant. I think the anaethstatist (?) wasn't very experienced because she tried to get the catheter into the back of my hand and failed, and by the time she got it into my inner elbow I was soon wheeled off for the job. I think I was more dozy afterwards than during, which was not great. This information can probably be seen on youtube, apart from Napoleon, but I would rather not see that.Anyhow, I am more concerned with what you think about the power and outcome of this treatment, now I know what he did, and should I carry on, or should I wait and see?Thank you all"

Right now im seeing clear at 12 inches after that ot gets more and more blurry. 10 feet away is completely blurry. I had used mono vision contact for near in my right wye for many years. Left eye fine. This surgery is for prevention of glaucoma but i feel it caused me to loose clarity now. Feeling disappointed discouraged and fearful of second surgery. What are my options for iol?

Cataract,Similar target versus result difference for both eyes after IOL?,"I have now had one IOL implanted (vitrectomy and IOL surgery) and am considering adjusting the lens target for the other eye based on the first result. I was aiming ideally for around -1.25D to -1.50D for one eye and -1.75D to 2.00D for the other using monofocal IOLs after deciding against multifocal/EDOF etc.The first eye had a target of -1.39D and the result is -1.00D (astigmatism reduced from -0.50D to -0.25D ).My surgeon says it's likely the other eye will have a similar offset, and suggests allowing for an expected error of 0.4D, or half that if being more cautious.So I am curious what people here have experienced with target versus result differences across both eyes?"
Cataract,Clear lense exchange ,Hello. I am 35 years old and had the cataract surgery done as an elective. I’ve had terrible sight my whole life and was convinced this would help me see and be rid of glasses. My vision was a -16. I was pretty near sighted. I had both eyes done. It’s been 6 weeks for one eye and 5 for the other. This is by far the worst decision I have ever made. Maybe time will tell. But these last 5 weeks have been nothing but miserable. I am unable to see distance. My vision is currently 20/60. I need readers for anything arms length. My eyes are very goopy and blurry. I did 2 weeks of the drops as directed. Now I’m on newer more expensive drops. I’m scheduled to have my lenses cleaned in 2 weeks due to buildup. How can I have buildup only after a month?! I’m already $7000 into this and will have to pay lore for this procedure. Anyone else experience this? If I could go back and take them out I would. There is nothing more frustrating than not being able to see a road sign or my child on the baseball field.

Both yag laser done in January due to build up. So after yag was performed I had terrible clumps floating across my vision as I moved my eyes. Dr said they would go away. Well went back to May 5 and he said they haven't gone away which I was thankful that he atleast acknowledged it this time because it is maddening to see these things in my vision all the time. He suggested to try yag again to see if he could break it up more. So did yag a week ago and it's about 25% better. So my question to all of you is should I keep going and getting yags done or should I see a retina specialist for maybe a vitrectomy? Just curious on anyone's thoughts. These clumps floatin through my vision exhaust me. Thanks in advance for any help.George Ok so I am a 45 year old male and had catarac surgery in both eyes.

Cataract,Symfony IOL refraction target suggestions?,"Hello. At a young age of 25, I had catarct surgery with a monofocal lens set to distance in my right eye a month ago. My left eye is normal and untouched. Because the surgery happened abruptly with no prior information, I was devastaed with the loss of near and intermediate vision. Because I am a developer and intermediate vision is paramount, I have talked to another surgeon about getting the monofocal lens replaced with the Symfony, which he said was possible.But I'm struggling to decide upon the refractive target I should ask for. My wish is that I would be able to see clearly from about 55cm (21.5 inch) onwards. I won't mind blurriness for anything nearer, but I want to see 'quite comfortably' at this range and onwards, even without the aid of my other untouched eye. I am struggling to decide between targeting for 0D, -0.5D, or maybe -0.25D... Could anyone share their experience on target refraction for the symfony and their results? I know people's experiences vary alot, but I would be grateful for any suggestions or advice. Thank you in advanceNOTES:- Before the monofocal lens implant, my vision for the eye had been -5.00D (myopic) with astigmatism, which was corrected by incision. But I suspect astigmatism was not removed completely as things are still a bit blurry."
Cataract,lens implant for extremeshortsightedness/astigmatism/cataract,"Hello everybody, I am 52 and live in France, I am due to have lens implants next week and the week after (25th May and 1st June) for my eyes which are about -16 and -2 astigmatism and cataracts (which I am not sure that I am aware of). I saw my opthalmist on Thursday and he says he can only bring it down to -3. This is a worry as I was hoping for better. He is very busy and obviously even though my French is good, it is not that good when they get technical. In France the cost is zero to me for early stage cataracts. In March I went to the UK for an opinion at Optimax, which was private; I think they were considering different strength lenses in each eye possibly, and follow-up laser tweaking included in the price (about 5000 pounds).

He put a ring around my eye to prevent blinking. Machine came over my face all I could see were red and whit lights- 3 climbs of lingual in middle. He said to keep looking at than.

Cataract,"Wrong iol for me, not sure of options to fix","Hi - I had cataract surgery on my left eye approx a month ago. During the initial consult, my doctor said I would get a standard monofocal lens set for distance, that other lens were not an option due to glare and contrast issues. Having been near sighted since a child, and working in IT, being able to read electronic devices such as a pc is important to me. When I voiced my concerns to the doctor, I was told I can wear readers for near vision. So I went forward, expecting to make lemonade from lemons.Not long after the surgery, I was told I could have opted for near vision, as well as correction for my astigmatism with a premimum lens. I feel the doctor did not disclose all my options prior to surgery to make an informed decision.I have verified with a different practice that it can be fixed though most likely will be considered elective by my insurance. I reached out to a different doctor at the original practice who also confirmed this, who also advised they will waive their charge ($6000) but I will have to cover the hospital charge ($15000 if no insurance).While I appreciate covering their cost, my desire to get a premimun lens, like a trulign that is accomadating aspheric toric monofocal set for near vision, may be an issue for them to cover. Not too comfortable about my covering the hospital cost for what to me, seems like a mistake on the doctor's part due to the level of experience.Any suggestions on my options as I am not happy with leaving it set to far distance and wish to resolve it before doing the other eye?Hi - I had cataract surgery on my left eye approx a month ago.

Cataract,Doc implanted IOL for intermediate vision without consulting with me,"I had cataract surgery on my right eye last week. Prior to surgery, I did not meet with the ophthalmologist to discuss livestyle/expectations, which I found a little odd. My only communication was with the technician who measured my eye with lasar and then extended his arm and told me this was the distance that I would see clearly at and I would need glasses. Since I wear contact lenses and have needed readers for over twenty years, I thought that I would be getting a distance lens and he was indicating the start of good vision. This is not the case. I can only see very clearly at about 4 feet. I find this distance very disorienting and feel nauseous when walking and reading. At this point I need glasses/contact for both distance and close up work. My other eye does not in need of surgery yet. I am really upset because this intermediate vision does not work for me. Does anyone have any advice? I am very annoyed with myself for not insisting on seeing ophthalmologist prior to surgery."
Cataract,My cataract surgery experience,"My surgery went well. My dr now uses a Halcion pill rather than an IV ( twilight sleep). He says it’s safer and you can be released sooner. I was on the border of 1 or 2 pills ( dependent on body weight and tolerance- I have a glass of wine about 4-5 days a week) and decided on one. Next time I may do 1 1/2 or 2 , though if I have 2 I will have to have someone drive me to the post op appt 24 hrs later! I didn’t feel it affected me at all. I found myself tensing up ( like at the dentist) and having to consciously take deep breaths and relax my muscles. Three or four times I felt a tiny amount of pain. I hadn’t expected that and worried it might get worse and what if I’d jump and he had a scalpel in there. After , the nurse told me that’s normal as long as what I felt was tolerable and it was. He inserted a non- prescription contact for a day to help healing because the numbing drops can degrade the eye and cause corneal abrasions I didn’t wake up the next day with great vision like my husband had after his surgery. The dr said it can take 7-10 days. I wondered if it was because I had waited 2 1/2 years to have the surgery and the dr said it was dense and a bit tough to remove. "

In April of 2016, I moved forward with the YAG surgery hoping this as the answer but this made everything worse. I can no longer drive at night due to starburst and and am left struggling to get home before the sun goes down every night from work I have been to four other eye doctors in my area and all of their diagnosis disagree.

Cataract,Have a cataract in my dominant eye and needing help and information...,"I have a cataract in my right dominant eye. I also have a yeast infection I can't get rid of because of my autoimmune system. I went to an eye dr had a test he said it was a beginning stage of a cataract he couldn't remove it. He was pretty rude and didn't want to talk to me and shoved me pretty much. I didn't get to really ask many questions or anything. I don't know if the yeast infection caused the cataract, I am 37, my grandma had glaucoma and my mom had cataracts. My eye also leaks tears every now and then and I have no idea why. I dunno if its from the yeast infection thats in my body or if its from the cataract. I just don't know.. I am hoping someone here can help me."
Cataract,Refractive Lens Exchange or Clear Lens Exchange,"Hi allRLE is the same procedure as cataract except it's an elective procedure done on people who don't have cataracts. I'm considering having this done in Malaysia (I live in Singapore). If I go ahead I'll go over the border to Johor Bahru (JB) so I can get there and back relatively easily for appointments. The cost in JB is half the price of having it done in Singapore.I will be 50 next year and I have been wearing glasses for short-sightedness since I was 14 (I wore soft contact lenses for most of my 20's and early 30's but stopped due to them becoming uncomfortable). My prescription is currently around -5.5 in both eyes with some astigmatism in both. I apparently have borderline keratoconus as well. I also now have a problem with seeing close-up and I wear glasses with progressive lenses in them but find myself taking them off for close-up reading because I can see better without them.My sister had the same op at Moorfields in London three years ago (she went with the monovision option). She has no regrets (her eyesight was -10 so she was far worse than me) and has had no problems with her eyes since the op - she occasionally wears reading glasses for close up work but mostly she's spec free.In the last 5 years I've spent over SG$6000 on glasses (I have progressive sunglasses too) and no doubt I'll need more glasses in the coming years. The RLE op will cost me about SG$6000 and hopefully I'll be mostly spec free for the rest of my life (if I do need specs they should be relatively cheap compared with my current glasses).My concerns about the RLE surgery are mostly to do with what is the best option for me regarding lenses. I know my surgeon will advise me based on the tests they do and my lifestyle choices but I also want to do my own research (I have my first appointment on 30 Sept) as this is a big decision to make.I've decided that I won't be able to handle not being able to see close-up (as currently I can just take off my glasses if I want to be able to see close up). I do a lot of reading and computer work (I'm a teacher). I would be willing to sacrifice some far distance vision for very good close-up and intermediate vision - so I wouldn't mind wearing glasses for driving or watching movies but I'd like to be spec free the rest of the time. If I have to wear glasses all the time for near distance then there's no point me doing the op!There's so much conflicting advice regarding monofocals, multifocals, trifocals, monvision or mini-monovision and although I've read many of the posts on this site, I'm still not sure which way is the best.Has anyone got any experience with trifocals? These seem like a possible option but of course there's the problems of glare at night which seems to be standard with all multi and trifocals.I'd like to hear from anyone who has had their lenses replaced regarding which option they went with and how their eyes are faring so far. Thanks in advance!My reasons for wanting to do the op is because I'm just so tired of wearing glasses and I find that I can't see properly with the progressives (near, intermediate, far) - everything is either blurred or slightly distorted.

Cataract,Continued blurred vision from 2wks to 2months after cataract surgery,"About two weeks after cataract surgery, my vision seemed to get blurrier. I assumed it was just taking time for healing. It's been two months and it is not getting any better. Initially, my doctor told me to use one drop of the Prednisolone per day when I saw him the day after surgery. I week later, he says I still have inflammation but should pass - continue with the Prednisolone. After another week or two he upped the dosage to three times per day. That didn't work and he switched me to a stronger steroid. After a couple of weeks, he said the inflammation was gone and my eye pressure was up a bit so he now has me on a decreasing dosage of Prednisolone for three weeks. My vision has not improved. He says everything looks good. I'm a bit worried that something is amiss. Anyone experience the same thing?About two weeks after cataract surgery, my vision seemed to get blurrier. I assumed it was just taking time for healing. It's been two months and it is not getting any better. Initially, my doctor told me to use one drop of the Prednisolone per day when I saw him the day after surgery. I week later, he says I still have inflammation but should pass - continue with the Prednisolone. After another week or two he upped the dosage to three times per day. That didn't work and he switched me to a stronger steroid. After a couple of weeks, he said the inflammation was gone and my eye pressure was up a bit so he now has me on a decreasing dosage of Prednisolone for three weeks. My vision has not improved.

Cataract, IOL EXCHANGE - SUCCESS ON EXPLANTATION/REIMPLANTATION OF IOL'S ,"Has anyone on here had their IOLs removed and new ones implanted after RLE?I had oculentis mf30s implanted in both eyes in 2011 via Optical Express, it was an absolute success up to last September (2017).My left/dominant eye has cloudy vision, night time driving is nerve wracking especially in busy lit up areas and unfamiliar territory. I have been to a few Eye Specialists who have said they suspect a faulty lens, yag was performed with no improvement unfortunately.I am now waiting for an appointment to see a top Eye specialist in Dublin in the hope that he will replace the lens for me. Optical Express don't want to know unfortunately. Can anyone share their experience of getting a lens explanted and a new one implanted and how successful it was please?"

Cataract,"Monofocal IOLs set for distance or micro-monovision, and progressive contacts?","Hello everyone,I'm in my early 30s with rapidly progressing PSC cataracts and am going under the knife soon. Been doing lots of research as the lenses will have to last me a long time under all kinds of conditions. Before the cataracts I've been myopic and wore either glasses or contacts for my vision with correction for astigmatism. Did not have inconvenience dealing with contacts. Only drawback was that if I was in the water, I wouldn't wear any vision correction, and beach or water parks were really not my favorite.Now that I have the possibility of correcting my vision, I'm trying to get the best of all worlds. I do want night vision, I do want computer work and reading. I'm really not sold on the multifocal lenses given their side effects and rate of explantations. I am open to wearing progressive glasses or contacts to correct for near and intermediate. I'm not finding many reviews on wearing progressive contact lenses in eyes with bilateral monofocal IOLs set for distance. Does this option offer good intermediate and near vision without the need to take out the contacts during the day?What about having micro-monovision with dominant eye set for distance and non-dominant eye set for intermediate? This would necessitate wearing very different contact lenses, with dominant one trying to correct for intermediate and near, and the other one for near only? I wonder if that is even possible for some optic reason.It seemed like the ideal option would be Panoptix Toric done in Europe or Mexico,but would rather go the most natural way I can without side effects and much neuroadaptation. I know micro-mono would necessitate some but probably would not have to deal with ""sweet spots"" and acuity fall-offs. Crystalens seemed good but having them done at my age, I am certain to have them fibrose at some point and turn into monofocals.Frankly, I don't have much knowledge on progressive glasses or contacts. I know there's that ""sweet spot"" for head tilt with the glasses, but how does it work with contacts?Thank you in advance."
Cataract,Diary Post Surgery Mono-focal lens,"Hi All, As a few of you know I had started a diary with a title indicating it was being kept for the days ""prior to surgery"". But now that I'm post surgery, and thinking the other title might be misleading at this point, I'm creating a new one for anyone interested. To recap, my procedure involved only my left cataract affected eye with my unaffected right eye being still good for near reading (about 10-18 inches distance). The surgeon recommended the left eye be set for distance with the strategy in mind of a mono-vision result. So here it is T+1. I've been taking my drops as instructed. After surgery yesterday, my surgeon told me all went well. I did notice for several hours after the procedure the vision in my operated eye remained a bit blurred. I chalk that up to it still being dilated. This morning I awoke to more clarity in my operated eye and it seems to have continued to improve throughout the day so far. I have to say it's a strange experience to see out of my left eye now. I do notice the colours are more vivid, the whites whiter, the blues not as purplish, than in my right un-operated eye. Distance vision seems quite good. Intermediate not as good, and of course reading not good (as expected). Honestly, I was hoping for better intermediate vision. I don't know if my intermediate vision will improve in the operated eye over the next few days (can it? I don't know) , or if some mono-vision magic will happen as it works along with my right eye... but my expectations aren't too high right now. I was a bit nervous from the beginning that there might be a range in the intermediate where both eyes wouldn't cover. It seems this may have been realized. With all that said, I can probably go most of my day without needing glasses under today's conditions. I think for computer work or long reading sessions I'd need some correction of some sort. So depending on whether things settle in differently in the next couple of days or weeks and how motivated I am to want to change things up from here, I may explore what can be done with my right eye to get better intermediate without sacrificing too much of the near. I would prefer to have reasonably good vision from, say 18 inches and beyond.My surgeon called a few moments ago, too, just as I began this post to see how I was doing. He seemed to suggest that my eyes will get ""less cloudy"" over the next few days, but I did tell him that things seemed quite clear as of right now. I am to schedule a follow up appointment in the next week or two. I intend to discuss strategies to obtain the intermediate distance I'm seeking. It may be that I need a contact lens in my right eye...I don't know. All in all, whilst not THE perfect situation at the moment, things are much better than prior to surgery. G"
Cataract,My Cataract Journey,"I write this with hopes of helping someone else, as I'm a firm believer in Knowledge is Power.Twenty two years ago I had Lasik surgery, at the time my best corrected vision after Lasik was 20/30 in my left eye and 20/25 in my right. I was seeing great (compared to before) and I was glasses free so I didn't question why they couldn't get my vision to 20/20 with correction. Fast forward to 2013, I was sitting in hospice with my mom who was dying of ALS. I started to notice myself attempting to blink things into focus, readers were helping with my close up work (I was in my 40's after all so I knew readers would be necessary) But my distance vision was not clear and crisp as I was used to. My husband was seeing an opthalmologist for cataracts so after one of his checks with the doctor I decided to make an appointment for myself. This doctor confirmed, that I too had cataracts but they weren't age related cataracts, they were congenital or aka Posterior Polar Cataracts, not as common and far more risky to operate on. I sensed he was not comfortable doing the surgery when he told me I should wait for possible better technology. His words were....I'd hate for you to end up worse than you are now. So I left it. But I was prompted to look things up on the internet as most of us do when we get a diagnosis of any kind. I found very little information on PPC but what I did find confirmed that they are far less common and far more riskier to remove. I was not happy with the way I was seeing so I scheduled another appointment with my then, opthalmologist. He gave me a small prescription, hoping that maybe eyeglasses would help. They didn't. On yet another visit he put me on Restasis, hoping that would give some relief. It did not. He scheduled me with a specialist at the University of Michigan for a second opinion. He confirmed the posterior polar cataracts and sent me on my way. I even went back to Dr Tayfour in Windsor, Ontario who performed the Lasik. He too confirmed the cataracts and said he would be glad to remove them but this was a long way to go for me since I now lived 2 hours north in Michigan. I wouldn't have minded going to him but my insurance would not have paid anything and the follow up appointments back and forth would have been diffiuclt.So time went on and I didn't do anything. On one of my next check ups with my then, opthalmologist I mentioned to him......Dr Tayfour said he would feel comfortable doing the surgery.......at which time he got up from his chair and said.....then I suggest you go see Dr Tayfour. He obviously was not comfortable performing the surgery and I'm grateful he let me know. I mean who would want to have an already risky surgery at the hands of someone who was not at ease performing it.I had a neighbor who had almost lost her sight due to an accident and she referred me to her doctor, and in talking to someone else who had shingles in his eye, he happened to have the same doctor. Both of them raved about how this doctor saved their sight. So I decided to go see him.On my very first visit, I felt comfortable that I would want him to be my doctor. Still years went by with him monitoring me annually to see where I was with the cataracts. He said on top of the posterior polar cataracts I had the beginning of the age related clouding of the lens. After Christmas this past year, I wasn't seeing well enough to drive so I went to him and he said, I think its time we remove the cataracts. I agreed. And we moved forward with the testing etc. I was able to provide them with my pre Lasik numbers which would help with choosing the correct IOL power, although they still couldn't promise me they could achieve the distance vision I wanted. And, because they have to, they explained to me the risks involved with removing this type of cataract. The biggest risk being the capsule at the back of the eye could rupture (tear sounds so much better) This weighted heavily on me. I could just live with the cataracts that would in time just get worse or I could take the risk. Very tough!!! So, I had my right eye done. Surgery itself was successful but the distance vision was not achieved. I'm at 20/40 in that eye. He said he would tweak things to achieve a better distance result in the left eye. I put off having the left eye done until 6 weeks later. I had my left eye done on April 19th. This cataract was more adhered to the capsule and resulted in a tear of the capsule. The first day of surgery I could not see anything out of my left eye. The next day, everything was hazy but I went in for my 1 day follow up and my pressure was up. He used the forceps to relive the pressure and put me on glaucoma drops. My vision is better but Dr told me a piece of lens fell back behind the capsule so he sent me to a retina specialist. Retina specialist got me in quickly and he said the piece that fell back is the outer part of the lens and will likely be reabsorbed by the body. He said if it had been the central part of the lens my body pressure would likely stay up and I would have far more inflammation than what I do have. He wants to see me in a week but advised me to call him immediately if I see an influx of floaters or experience any pain. At which point he said a vitrectomy might be needed.It pains me to write all of this, but is also therapeutic. Not many people understand. I hope to educate/help anyone who has this form of cataract. I would have given anything to talk to someone all those years ago when I was first diagnosed. Most people consider cataract surgery to be uncomplicated and in most cases for traditional cataracts, that is the case. But I'm here to tell you not all cataracts are created equal.God Bless,"
Cataract,"Newbie , researching cataract surgery ","Looking for advice and guidance! I been diagnosed with cataract in both eyes. I finally saw an ophthalmologist yesterday. Brief exam, dilated eyes, told me I had cataract. Explained to me the IOL for distance, near vision and the expensive IOL. Never ask me about my life style, I work on a computer daily. Told me the distance IOL would start at around 3-4 feet out. Very disappointing experience, scheduled surgery, then cancel when I came home. Is this how it is normally done!.?"
Cataract,Post Cataract Surgery Sunglasses,"I remember 10-15 years back, right after cataract surgery, patients were told to wear big dark sunglasses, almost like a welders goggles for several days. Then came the clear-lens sunglasses, and most would think what an improvement over those dark (somewhat ugly) sunglasses. These seem to be a thing of the past. Now a days, you are given an eye shield/patch, that's held by tape, at least in the United States. In countries like India, you are still given those clear sunglasses. And many doctors in the US don't even recommend the eye shield. It's a debate in the medical community, where some feel, it is not necessary to wear throughout the day, just in the night. Others feel, its 'safer' to have them wear it throughout the week post-surgery.I would personally feel more comfortable with a pair of wrap-around sunglasses to protect my eyes from sun, dirt/dust/debris, harsh wind, water.What does the community over here feel? If you have used sunglasses right after cataract surgery, which brand would you recommend?Thanks."

My doctor says it could be drying in the eyes and to try Systane eye drops. 1) Has anyone else experienced this? Also, 2) night driving I have only done once as I was a little apprehensive seeing halos and concentric circles especially with LEDs.

( He gave me a temporary glasses to look at the computer and the streets thru the window). I was so happy for a while but something just hit me. How about my vision at night? I am afraid I will lose too much depth of view with my enlarged pupil and my vision will get blurry for both driving and computer reading, defeating the whole purpose.Any ideas?"
Cataract,cataract surgery years after lasik,"I've recently undergone cataract surgery. The first eye was done with a multifocal Toric lens 12/21/2017. The second eye was done with just a mutlfdocal lens 12/28/2017. So far it has been a rollercoaster ride of recovery. Horrible vision, no clarity at any distance, and when lowering the dose of prednisone drops, eye strain/pain and light sensitivity to the point it woke me up at 5am, only to wear sunglasses in the house to get to my drops and ibuprofen. Dr finally changed steroid drops to durezol after the third episode, and thankfully I have survived the transition this weekend. To recap: My first follow up on first eye the day after surgery left me confused, and I was asked to return the next business day (Tuesday after xmas) where it was mentioned that the wrong power was installed and a swap might be in the future but dr wanted to ""wait and see' and was confident that second procedure would be successful, so I went ahead. Second eye follow up the following day gave me much more clarity at a distance than the first eye, but then again, there was little to correct distance wise prior and I had no astigmatism in that eye. No close up vision was clear. So, here I am a month out from first procedure, and there is little improvement in first eye. dr says, we may not need to replace that IOL after all. But now since the reduction of prednisone has caused a flare up, my vision that was better in second eye has gotten much worse. My next follow up is in two weeks, the new dose of durezol will end the night before this visit.The mention of a lasik enhancement has re-entered the conversation. From what I am understanding, Im a slow healer, this is new for me, and that any further procedure would have to wait at least 90 days.

Cataract,Flashing sight with squared edge monofocal iols,"Hello! I had cataract surgery many months ago with an acrylic multifocal iol but it didn't work due to unbearable and multiple dysphotopsias that never diminished over the time. The multifocal had squared edges.

The reflection hits the edge producing internal reflections and with every micro eye movement you can see your sight flashing, flickering. If you keep your eye absolutely steady, no flashes at all.

Cataract,Cataract question/piggyback lens,"Hi, I posted on here 2 weeks ago about having my first eye done and the distance vision that Dr was aiming for was not quite achieved. (I'm a previous Lasik patient) Some new questions/concerns have come to light. I'm approaching 3 weeks post-op and my near vision is great but my distance vision is not.Gonna try my best to explain my dilemma. I'm right eye dominant, my right eye had cataract surgery and although they aimed for distance my best vision is at 2 to 3 feet in this eye. Distance vision is better out of my left eye currently, but the two eyes together I am not seeing well enough to drive. In fact the two eyes aren't working together at all. Like I'm constantly trying to focus. I'm told this is because I'm in between surgeries.My doctor said that once we decide to do my left eye, he would tweak things to hopefully achieve the better distance vision in that eye. He said this may be advantageous to have one near and one distance eye. But in essence, its what I have currently and its not working well for me. Is this because of the whole dominant eye thing?He also mentioned if there is still a refractive error in my right eye, that he could do a piggy back lens. Has anyone had this done? "
Cataract,Adjusting to mini monovision after cataract surgery,"Hi, I had my second eye done.

Cataract,Is a multifocal IOL not truly multifocal?,"This is part of an email I received from my cataract surgeon's office pre-surgery. I am trying to decide between monovision and Symfony (actually an extended depth of focus lens I think).-""No matter what target or lens we choose, there's no perfect solution and glasses are the solution for further fine tuning of vision afterwards. With either monovision or multifocal, there will be some compromise between very near vision and intermediate vision because we realistically have 2 focal points to work with and roughly 3 major zones of vision.""So is he saying it's actually bifocal, not trifocal or multifocal?"

Cataracts measured 3 in (L) and 2.5 in (R) ?Although surgery went well, and intermediate vision is very good, I'm concerned my distance vision won't equal even what I am seeing in my right eye with progressive glasses.

I'm seeing the glare, starbursts, and halo's but not too bothersome at this point, and no concentric circles yet. ?What I'm wondering is, if this concern on distance vision continues for a couple weeks, should I consider a toric monovision lens set at distance in my dominate eye? Would I be losing any symmetry in not having two toric symfony's? Would having only one Symfony be less glare, starbursts, and halo's than two Symfony's? ?Have appreciated previous advice I received on this site, God bless you all. "
Cataract,Cataract surgery and double vision. ,It has been about 12 weeks since I had surgery for my new Symfony lenses. About 2 weeks after my second eye had been completed I realized my vision was not great. I began to realize I was experiencing double vision. It continues today. I have revisited my surgeon and my optometrist. Both have tested and confirm this but have not given me any substantial reasons why this is happening. I will be seeing the surgeon in a month again. It has become less bothersome but it is definitely still there. Have any of you experienced this or heard about this happening. I am very disappointed. 
Cataract,Cataract Surgery,"Hi everyone. I'm brand new here & tried to respond to another cataract surgery discussion on this forum but was unable to. I'm a 55 year old female who developed cataracts due to the steroids I've had to take for my asthma, & I had my first cataract surgery on my left eye last Wednesday, 6 days ago. I got fitted for a monofocal lens after reading that a monofocal lens was less likely to get the halo/starburst effect.The first time I drove at night, about day 4, things were crystal clear, no glare, no halos, no starbursts. I was quite happy with it. Then, last night, while night driving, there were the starburst & I am devastated! I can't help but feel I've done something wrong, like bending over. I've tried not to bend over, but no have a few times because I forgot. I know no one can give me answers, but I'm just wondering is anyone has had this happen to them & then had the starburst go away. I haven't spoken to my Dr yet, but I'm a nervous wreck that this is going to be permanent. Just seeking to hear about others experiences.Thanks!"
Cataract,Why does google say differant from what I was told,Had cataract surgery on right eye and I was told by doc that I could go back to gym and do cardio or even lifting pretty much right away.

Cataract,Cataract Surgery post op,I had cataract surgery 4 days ago. At my post op visit later that day I had 20/20 vision which I’ve never had. The scheduled me the Same day because their office was closed on the Friday which was the following day. Since that day my distance vision is very blurry. I was just in a Walmart store and wanted to scream for how blurry my distance vision was. It Also feels as though there is a particle or a grain of sand in my eye. My one week follow up is in four days. I plan on discussing these issues with my ophthalmologist. But I also have a phone call into them to get some of these questions answered. Was wondering if any of you have ever experienced the same issues recently after cataract surgery. I know that I am not seeing 2020 out of this eye. Prior to cataract surgery I did not wear glasses to drive but now I do not feel comfortable driving. I’m considering canceling the cataract surgery for my left eye which is scheduled in two weeks. I’d appreciate any input any of you might have

After the operation there will be a period until my eyes settle down enough for my prescription to be reviewed and get new glasses. In the mean time do I continue to wear my old glasses, as normal cover up the eye that has been operated onI would value any advice you can give"
Cataract,Options for right eye IOL surgery with high degree myopia in left eye (but otherwise no cataract),"I am 47 and have cataract developed in my right eye but my left eye is fine (so far). Both of my eyes have a prescription around -6D with some astigmatism. My ophthalmologist says I cannot have IOL in my right eye targeting Plano and do LASIK or contact lens on the left eye because the size of the image of the two eyes will be slightly different and my brain won't like that. She said i need to do IOL on both eyes, but I really don't want to shot my left eye when there is nothing wrong with it.Is that a concern? Any suggestions and input are very appreciated. Thanks."
Cataract,Did I really have cataracts?,"Hi All,I won’t repeat the details of my cataract nightmare, (You’re welcome. Lol). I’d seen an optometrist about 3 months prior to ophthalmologist visit. It had been a long time since I’d seen an actual MD, so thought it might be worth a trip. Got my records from optometrist, had the medical secretary decipher them, and there was no mention of cataracts. I’d asked the MD on my first visit why the optometrist didn’t tell me I had them. “They’re in the business of selling glasses!” My spidey sense told me to get out of there as it seemed to be a veryflippant, unprofessional response. Should have gone with my gut. Anyone else have a similar experience? Can’t believe any doc would perform an unnecessary surgery, but could both eyes have developed severe enough issues to warrant removal within such a short time span? Also, has anyone-post surgery-experienced tired eyes? Within 15 minutes of reading, my eyes get so tired that I’m literally unable to keep them open any longer. Look forward to any responses!"
Cataract,Is Targeting the Dominant Eye for Distance Necessary for a MonoVision Strategy?,"Hi Everyone, Most, if not all, articles I've read on the subject of mono-vision say that the dominant eye is the one that should be targeted for distance and the non-dominant eye for reading. I've been informed by my consultant/surgeon that my cataract affected eye, which is also my non-dominant eye, is being targeted for distance whilst my near sighted non-cataract affected eye will stay natural. So I'm wondering... How necessary is it that the dominant eye be given the implant for distance in a mono-vision scenario? I'm scheduled to have the surgery in the next 10 days or so, so I'm trying to finalize all this knowledge. Thanks. Regards, G "

Cataract,Eyesight Issues after Cataract Surgery,I had cataract surgery 1 week ago and the lens fitted corrected my astigmatism. On my follow up appointment 2 days post surgery I was told everything was as expected and my eye was now -1 instead of -5 prior to the surgery.I explained to the consultant that whilst everything was clearer (well it should be once the cataract was removed) I am getting blurred vision and it feels like I can see the edge of the new lens. He totally dismissed this and did not even provide an explanation. I believe the new lens is not fitted correctly but cannot prove otherwise.Has anyone else had (or heard of anything similar) to this?Thanks
Cataract,Choosing between a monofocal IOL vs Symfony IOL ,"Hello everybody I'm writing this because I am a 26 year old guy getting ready to get my cataract surgery in my left eye due to an accident that made me rapidly develop bad vision and require surgery in order to see clearly again out of that eye. (Although I have small cataracts in right eye as well) I have been waiting and waiting for a couple of years because at first, I wasn't comfortable getting a monofocal IOL which the opthamologist has been reccomending for me for quite some time; Because I had hopes of newer technology becoming available in the near term. I was eager about the Symfony when it was first announced it would be available here in the USA and after reading the specs I was determined to get this IOL implanted in my eye. on paper these lens seemed like the best lens possible that was available here in the USA but however it doesn't seem like many people are satisfied about some of the adverse effects that these Symfony lens are starting to becoming more and more frequent among people that get these implanted. My main worry about the IOL lens is that they have a risk of troublesome halo's, starbursts, and glares associated around bright lights. I am a young adult so I can fathom having to struggle with that issue for the rest of my life.My main focus and passion that I want to do for my career will require me to be working on computers most of the time since I want to pursue a 3D animation and graphics engineering career in the entertainment industry. I love the idea of having the Symfony lens because it would be really convenient to work in that setting and atmosphere not requiring multiple types of glasses to see on the fly at screens and monitors and distance. Etc and I certainly would not mind using reading glasses for the near. but Im a bit Disappointed to see numerous reports of people complaining about the night time visuals in regards to bright lights. I feel like this would be something that would seriously make me question if it is truly worth having seamless distance/intermediate vision but not being able to handle going out at night from headlights/city lights/ bright. I'm only 26 years old and I know That I can not NOT avoid going out at night. Especially if I had to go to big cities like Los Angeles New York etc. what if I want to go to a night time festival with lots of LED lights or light projections? (Not that Thats all i do but if having Symfony lens makes those experiences unpleasant?) is it worth it? I honestly feel like if some of those issues were a problem for so many people would also apply to watching a cinema in the movies or viewing some types of hi resolution Video animations in dark environments would recreate that dramatic effect of bright light sensations like halos, glare that it makes that viewing unpleasant for their experience... most of the people say their fine for tv's and computers but what about dark scenes or when light is highly concentrated and dispersed might make somebody with Symfony dizzy? Would a monofocal IOL be safer just to avoid adverse reactions and sensations to extreme lights? For people here that been implanted with the Symfony IOL vs a monofocal IOL do monofocal really have less glare and halos. Also Monofocal IOL implants how are you doing with night vision? And also how is your computer time like quality of vision and light sensations etc. I see that a lot of people are satisfied with the Symfony for computer usuage because it offers more range towards intermediate but I honestly might consider trade off for monofocal and wearing those glasses to avoid those light artifacts associated with the Symfony. Whenever I research articles on review/reports on the internet about the Symfony IOL their is a lot of contradicting information that makes choosing that lens extremely difficult for me...I honestly don't know which studies to believe because I've read several and most of them say something different about the Symfony IOL. The one from medscape says that the nighttime problems are actually worst than multifocals and the case study from healio points out to it being comparable to a monofocal.... most people that post about the Symfony say their is a significant amount of glare/halos. And Not to mention that their is under the radar trait in Symfony that so many people are having several concentric circles around bright lights!! I can not deal with that if I were to pursue a computer graphics career. Although it may not be a make or break factor...I know it's hard to compare subjectively. Anybody here with both a Symfony IOL and a monofocal IOL in the other eye?; that would probably be the best annodoctal experience to have. I have to make my decision soon in about a month. I really am having such a difficult decision to choose which IOL because this is likely going to be a permanent choice for the rest of my life and I'm still relatively young at 26. I know people talk about getting a new IOL lens swapped for their current IOL in the future but I would imagine this brings along repercussions because there are major risks involved with doing extra surgeries after your lens has healed into your eye. Vision may become worse afterwards despite switching lens for supposedly better tech. What I'm trying to say is the choice I make for my cataract surgery of IOL lens is most likely going to be a permanent decision for the rest of my entire life. I will have to think this over again but Thank you for taking the time if you read all of this. "
Cataract,Crystalens cataract surgery,"I had cataract surgery one week ago on my right eye with Crystalens. I was very farsighted. The doctor said he would reduce the farsightedness somewhat in this eye. I went in for my post-op checkup, and the doctor said my eyesight in that eye is twice as nearsighted as he was aiming for. The lens is diopter 23. I can read without glasses, but anything beyond reading range I have to wear my glasses. This is somewhat frustrating, as of course, the right eye is blurry with glasses. Is this normal or is it an error on the doctor's part in calculating the lens strength? The doctor wants to wait about a month to see if the vision will settle down (ie., get more farsighted) before operating on the left eye and be able to calculate the lens. Thanks for any input.I had cataract surgery one week ago on my right eye with Crystalens. I was very farsighted. The doctor said he would reduce the farsightedness somewhat in this eye.

Cataract,Double vision immediately after cataract surgery,I just had cataract surgery today 5 hours ago. I am experiencing double vision. The eyes are noticesbly not pointing in the same directiion. The eye that was operated on is pointed slightly higher than the non-operated eye. To me this means the brain is not compensating to align both eyes correctly. My image of the right eye (operated eye) is either above or below the image collected by the left eye depending on the position of my head. If I look down the right eye image is above the left eye. and opposite if I tilt my head back. Needless to say I am worried about this continuing. I have Operation follow up appointment tomorrow early. Has anyone else have this problem?
Cataract,Multifocal/ Symfony - Delay when changing focus between near and far? ,"Hello, I had a Restor 2.5D implanted in my right eye 4 weeks ago. The cataract in my left eye is not yet affecting my vision and I have a multifocal contact in that eye. Overall the results are decent, but I do have one issue and I wanted to see if it was common for others with multifocal IOL's and also Symfony (as I am considering mixing Symfony with Restor once I reach the point where my other eye needs surgery).In my operated eye, both my far and near focus points work, so I know that the lens is OK. What I've noticed is that when I'm working on my computer, reading, or using my phone/tablet for an extended period of time, it takes a long time to regain my distance vision and the longer I've been performing the near task the longer it takes (and the worse the distance vision gets). For example, when I sit down at my desk around 8:30 AM, I can read 20/20 comfortably on my vision chart. By lunch, I'm more like 20/40 and by 5PM or 6PM, I'm probably 20/100. It takes 2-3 hours (at least) to get back to 20/40 and i will not get 20/20 until the next morning. My left eye (which has a multifocal contact) instantly adjusts to any distance.I'm wondering if others have experienced anything similar and if it improved over time? I do already try to look out the window every hour or two for a few minutes to use the more distant focus but it doesn't seem to help. Thanks. "
Cataract,Symphony lenses for my cataract operation,"I'm blind without a distance glasses for driving and look around and blind without a reading glass. My dr. Wanted to put Intraocular lenses for my fra sighted vision. He ignored my near sighted vision. I was having a sleepless nights thinking what will happen to my near sighted vision.

Cataract,Predicting results,"I had both eyes done last December, they put monofocals in both eyes. I was very nearsighted and had astigmatism.After the surgery I'm happy with my far and night vision, but without readers I can't see anything closer than two feet or so..feel like I'm a blind man when trying to see closer than 6 inches things that were never talked about in the surgical workupMy buddy just had his left eye done two days ago. He did not have astigmatism and had a very low correction on his glasses. He is very very happy with the results, he has both near and far vision after the surgery. We are both Vets so I assume the VA used the same lens manufacturer for both of us eliminating the possibility of the lens being different.So I'm thinking that the predictor of how successful the cataract surgery will be is how bad your eyes were to start with.It seems to me that the cataract surgeons don't inform their patients that the outcome is very dependent on your eyes pre surgery and give the impression that everyone will have good results at all distances."

Cataract,Double vision ,After developing cataracts I received symfony lenses about 6 weeks ago. I am concerned with my vision. I have developed double vision. My eyes don’t seem to be focusing properly together. On their own I am seeing very well in the distance and at present am using cheaters for reading. However the distance vision is not good when focusing with both eyes. I have made an appointment with my doctor but am wondering if anyone else has experienced this. 
Cataract,Glasses and years after Cataract Surgery,I had IOL Surgery when i was 18. Some 25 years ago now. To be honest l've never really used glasses. I never had a huge desire to drive and got by ok day to day without glasses. In the past i'd go to my local high street shop and get a prescription every couple of years. Recently l went for a check up and the optician said l'm in the legal requirement for driving with my vision. My vision has always been around 6/12 6/10 on a Snellen. I said to him that this suprised me as in the early days l was told all that could be done for me had been done. I also said l felt l'd struggle to see a numberplate at 20.3m. I told him about not ever using my glasses. The question l am yrying to ask is. Do you have to give glasses a chance to work over a period of time or should l see through them what l will always see from the offset. I don't want to be paying out for glasses that ain't going to make much difference. But. at the same time if there is a chance of seeing a numberplate by being persitent with glasses (which l never have been) then is it worth buying glasses. I'm just wondering if anyone has been in a similiar situation. Many ThanksI had IOL Surgery when i was 18. Some 25 years ago now. To be honest l've never really used glasses.

Cataract,Diary Leading up to Surgery,"Hi All, If this topic is unacceptable to the moderators (being that it's not a question per se), I'm happy for this thread to be deleted. I've been pining for a couple of days whether I should write a brief diary or not as I lead up to my surgery on Monday. I just wanted to express my thoughts on this whole experience for my and others' benefit so that those who wish to relate to these feelings can do so. My situation, as some on this forum may know from some of my previous posts, is that I'm in my early 50's with a cataract in my left eye. My right eye is more or less cataract-free and nearsighted. I noticed my vision slowly deteriorating in my left eye (or maybe I was just becoming more progressively aware of it) over the past couple of years. With that has come a bit of depression, a loss of confidence, and overall frustration at not being able to see well in dim light (or any light). It really snuck up on me. I found myself wiping my glasses more frequently thinking I was clearing off the ""fog"", and oftentimes wondered if I just needed a new prescription. It came as a shock nevertheless when I found out it was a cataract and I was told it might have developed as a result of the use of steroid nasal sprays that I had used at various times in the past. I'll probably never know for sure if that's true or not. It has been taking me some time to adjust psychologically to the notion of having a piece of plastic inserted into my eye. I feel that some intimate part of me is being taken away, and indeed that is literally the case. Virtually everything I've experienced in my life has passed through the cloudy lens my surgeon is going to take out next Monday the 19th with a phacoemulsification machine. It's a bit weird to think it that way perhaps, but I do. Being a rather analytical person, I've been doing all sorts of research (as many of you have been doing as well) in an effort to both understand the process and, through that understanding, to ease some of the fear of the procedure itself, however safe and effective it is statistically speaking. I've been to the NHS (I'm an American but live in the UK), a chain clinic, and a couple of private clinics. I've tried to find the best surgeon I can, read the reviews, checked out YouTube videos, etc.I've opted to go with a mono-focal lens in that left eye, set for distance, with the hope that I might be able to cope on the extreme side of a mono-vision strategy (2 diopter difference approximately). I figure with my right eye I can either use it as is for close reading, or either put a contact lens in that eye or do a laser correction if I have trouble tolerating the mono-vision. I don't feel I need to be completely spectacle free, but I would like to go ""generally"" about my day without glasses. My father, who is in his upper 80's) had both his eyes done a few months ago with mono-focals set for distance and he tells me he hardly ever wears glasses anymore. What a great feeling it will be to see clearly again, assuming all goes well. I feel optimistic and nervous at the same time. Can anyone out there relate to this? What kind of research have you done? Are/Were you confident of a good outcome? Is it a big thing for you in your mind? or do you have a ""business as usual"" mindset with no worries? Would be interesting to hear your experiences as well. G "
Cataract,Has anyone had laser surgery?,"I was sold on laser surgery after reading this-http://www.allaboutvision.com/conditions/laser-cataract-surgery.htmHowever I asked my dr’s office if they did it and received this answer -“The laser cataract surgery is not something we typically do here . Dr Xxx has been trained on the equipment however he does not use it currently. I asked him about it and he said that laser cataract has a higher complication rate without any additional benefit to outcomes in his cases. Because of this, he doesn't recommend laser cataract for his patients.”"
Cataract,I want to be near sighted after cataract surgery,"I have already had cataract surgery on my left eye about 8 years ago. Its my bad eye. Now my good eye needs cataract surgery. I still need glasses for the left eye so I will be wearing glasses no matter what is done to right eye. I read without glasses with my right eye now. I can see sharp with right eye close in(near sighted) I want that to continue. I can quickly look over my glasses and read something like my phone with no problem. If I got the surgery to change that for long distance I would still have glasses but no longer be able to read without reading glasses making me have to change the glasses every time I want to read something like my watch. that would suck. Doctor has no problem making me nearsighted.BUT I go into docs office friday and i get all these options he NEVER said squat about before. LRI Limbal Relaxing Incisions 500 dollar adder or Toric Lens 900 dollar adder. Which both are supposed to reduce or fix Astigmatism. Not sure what to do. Would a Toric lens make sense because Iam having the Doc make me see close in already. Not seeing why I would want a Toric lens. Money is a factor. He has laser options that drive cost up tp $3025, yikes. I originally thought I was on the hook for 300 bucks. NOT 3 grand. Any opinions."
Cataract,IOL Transplant,"In September of last year I lost my eye on a jobsite a piece of tile had flew up under my safety glasses and sliced open my eye I have been doing major surgeries since. I am what they call a catastrophic trauma. I had just went under a iol transplant and my first one has fallen out. So I went back under surgery and they had replaced it, I have heard of people being able to see clearly or with some trouble vision, I on the other hand look like I'm looking through parchment paper and have absolutely no vision. I don't know whether I should get a second opinion from another opthamologist. It has been 7 months since my injury and still have no vision so I'm at a point where I am at a loss and don't know what to what to do. Any advice or Insight is greatly appreciated.In September of last year I lost my eye on a jobsite a piece of tile had flew up under my safety glasses and sliced open my eye I have been doing major surgeries since.

Cataract,Sunglasses and reading glasses,"I finally had my second cataract surgery - toric lenses and so far so good! My first eye done 4 weeks ago is super, but I do have to reading glasses. I have worn glasses for 55 years and it is weird to be glasses-free most of the time.I wondered about sunglasses. I have a large temporary pair that went over my glasses while I was waiting for the second operation. I believe I will need sunglasses to protect my eyes. But what do you do when you are outdoors and need to read? For example, my camera settings or some signage at a display, a guidebook.Has anyone tried getting just a sweet spot (that half-moon) of reading strength in plain lense sunglasses? Does it work? Any advice? I haven't been a regular sunglass wearer before.Thanks!"
Cataract,LASEK/LASIK after IOL - how accurate and correction options,"I have one IOL which was implanted 2 months back with the second implantation due in a weeks time. I already know the mini mono-vision I am aiming for will require at least one eye tweaked with laser as the first eye was a little too much off target (not myopic enough)For those that have had a laser correction post IOL, how accurate was that and also is there any issue with increasing myopia versus decreasing it which is the more common change?"
Cataract,LASIK after lens replacement,has anyone had the laser tweak after lens replacement? My distance vision is not clear but they say my prescription is only -0.5. Surgeon will do laser but as small prescription says may or may not make any difference or 1 / 2% chance could make things worse. Tough decision to make just wondered if anyone had the laser ??
Cataract,I had cataract surgery and 3 weeks after I have sudden blurred vision,I am 51 years old and had cataract surgery. My vision was amazing for 3 weeks. I woke on week 3 to blurred vision but its not normal blurred vision. Words look like they are disappearing like in a sentence only part of the letters appear and the rest disappear like looking through rain. Straight lines look squiggly like zig zaggy. Is this my vision now? I thought since my vision was amazing for the first 3 weeks that would be it. Its quite upsetting.

Cataract,Recent cataract surgery ,"Am one week out from cataract surgery for left eye. Had distance lens implant with astigmatism correction. Distance vision is now 20/20 but realized after surgery how debilitating it is to have lost my near vision ~ difficulty with phone, pill bottles, makeup, which I did not anticipate. The original plan was to correct both eyes with same type distance lens implant. My right eye (uncorrected) still has near vision with my glasses off which began quite some time ago. I am concerned now and thinking of possibly not having surgery on right eye now and have Rx progressive glasses made to accommodate both eyes.

Never had to use reading glasses before. I’m just so upset. I feel like I just got my money taken and my eyes in worse shape? Help!"
Cataract,I had cataract surgery a year ago and had the ACR Sof iQ toric lens put in.,"I have 20/20 vision, which I am very excited about. My issue is, it's like there is a smudge on the lens.

I have returned several times to my surgeons office, and seen other doctors in the practice, but not my doctor. Each time I am told I'm doing everything right, but they can't determine what it could be.

Cataract,Eye discomforts after cataract surgery,"Hi, I had my right eye operated for cataract 80 days ago and am still experiencing great discomforts:1) black rim at the far end corner of eye, research said it is due to Negative Dysfotopsia, talked to the doctor who operated me, he says there is nothing to be done, my brain will eventually adjust to it.2) I feel as if there is a dense drop of fluid of something inside my eye, I try to tissue it out, but my eye is dry. I put eye drop into my eye hoping it may be due to dry eye, but it is not. 3) my upper eyelid, to my amazement, has gone up after the surgery, I feel a form of heaviness, is it swollen for some reason caused by the operation? Asked my doctor, he said there is no swelliness, no inflammation.This all is very annoying and there has been no sign of any gradual improvement. Does anyone have similar experience after cataract surgery? "
Cataract,strange vision after cataract surgery,"Hi, I am only 2 days post cataract surgery. In the operated eye I constantly have brightish light the same as if you've looked at a bright light then looked away - that sort of ghosting...if that makes sense? I am a bit worried about this. It was a complicated surgery due to the cataract resulting from an injury a good few years ago. Just wondered if this is sort of normal to expect? Its not flashing lights (so I haven't pushed the retinal issue panic button yet!).Thanks Peeps Hi, I am only 2 days post cataract surgery.

Cataract,Two doctors needed?,"Hello folks. First time poster here.I am a 63 year old guy diagnosed with cataracts in both eyes with the right eye being the worse.The ophthalmologist told me there are two types of cataract surgery, one being the average/normal cataract surgery and one being the surgery with a high risk of complications involved.Of course after further discussion with him it seems as though I'm in the later group or the one with the high risk of complications.The reason he claims I am in this group is because I have had a cataract since probably birth. He said that if I had a clear lens just 5 or 10 years ago I would be in the normal surgery group.He explained to me that there is something similar to a door between the front of the eye and the back of the eye and it was possible that once surgery was started on the front of the eye that this door could have a hole in it that could possibly allow stuff to come from the back of the eye into the front of the eye thus causing a lot of problems.He said that I needed two doctors to do my surgery. A front of the eye doctor and a back of the eye doctor. His exact words. I told him that I never heard of that before but he assured me it was so.He said he could not do my surgery since he was only a front of the eye doctor and that I needed to be seen at a major city eye place.He made me an appointment in a city 3 hours away from our home.I guess my questions are this: has anyone ever heard of this problem before and has anyone ever heard the term front of the eye and back of the eye doctor?Maybe I should get another opinion?"
Cataract,Operated eye is getting cloudy ,I am 51 years old and have just completed a cataract operation on my left eye.However I noticed a few days after the operation that each time I move my eye there is a wave of cloud that goes back and forth with each eye move. I have since gone back to see the surgeon and he said everything looks good. Can anyone help please? 
Cataract,How do you find contact lenses after IOL?,"I've currently have one IOL and chose a monofocal lens (other eye being done soon). The reason for not having a multifocal IOL or EDOF IOL is because they all have some additional compromises and my preference was to have the sharpest vision to put glasses and contacts over as multifocal contacts don't work well over similar IOLs. I was aiming for mini mono vision with my IOLs, but this is looking near impossible to achieve due to targeting errors so augmenting them with contacts appears my best option. Many multifocal contacts come in low/medium/high adds and include 0 and +/-0.25D values so like glasses can be used to fine tune vision which isn't possible with standard contact lenses which have 0.25D increments but start at + or - 0.5D).I've been testing contacts lenses on my operated eye and comparing results with the other eye before it has its IOL. The reason for the post is I wondered how my experience compares to others and wanted to share some my thoughts as using contacts and especially multifocal after cataract isn't discussed much. In general I've found that monofocal contacts work well over my monofocal IOL, but for me leave an additional ring (light/slight blur) around parts of the edge of my vision in certain lights which wasn't the case before surgery. I am not sure if this is because I already have dysphotopsia issues (and starbursts) with that IOL or if its always an issue with IOLs. Does anyone else experience this?Multifocal contacts also work well over monofocal IOLs and interestingly have almost none of the ring issue as above. I presume this is because the zones of differing power break up the effect. As with multifocal/EDOF IOLs, multifocal contact lenses cannot fully cover the full range of vision and currently my preference once both eyes are done for my close work/hobby lifestyle is:Dominant eye: A medium add under adjusted to -1.00D as this will give an effective -1.00D to -2.25D range).Non dominant eye: A low add under corrected to -0.50D to give an effective -0.50D to -1.50D. That would leave me borderline for driving but I would use glasses over if needed for that or just use a different set of lenses with less under correction for those days. Contact lens manufacturers boast higher reading adds than I've listed above but in my experience they are far too optimistic.Has anyone here worn multifocal contacts long term after IOL?"
Cataract,Should I choose monovision or multifocal for cataract surgery?,"I saw the doctor today and am even more undecided now. I went in thinking Symfony multifocal. He said given that I've done well with monovision contacts for years , he'd say it's 50/50. I whad thought those who chose monovision did so due to cost and not because it was equal or superior to a multifocal lens.I saw the doctor today and am even more undecided now.

Cataract,Manual vs Laser ...When is one better than another? ,"Hi Everyone, Something I failed to mention in my previous threads on my situation is that my surgeon has recommended that he do my mono-focal lens implant without a laser. At the prices he charges, I was thinking maybe I'd be getting laser treatment. Again, it's a mono-focal lens so maybe the benefits of laser are not that great. He seemed to say that a laser would be put to use in breaking up the cataract in my eye, but I believe that's high frequency ultrasound (phaco-emulsification), right? In any case, when is it recommended that lasers are preferred over a manual procedure, and would there be any benefit in having the laser when it comes to a monofocal situation? Regards, G"
Cataract,Terrible problems after catarac surgery,So I am 45 years old and yes had two cataracs. So me being so active decided I had to get them fixed immediately. Went to doctor had a symphony lens for distance in right eye. Then realized how bad my left eye was and had done 4 weeks later with a multifocal symphony lens. Had problems at first with halos and glares etc. My brain was having a hard time adjusting. Then both of them started to get cloudy again. Dr said I needed to do yag. So obviously had this done on both eyes. This is all been done in a total of just 4 months. I now have all this debris in my eyes like oil smudge type feeling. When I look side to side or up and down I see it. My vision now is awful. I have such strain on my eyes it makes the base of my neck hurt and eyes are sooo strained. Going for a second opinion because surgeon says that everything is fine. Well I can promise you that it is so far from fine. This is the worst nightmare ever. I should have just dealt with the cataracs as they were much less debilitating than this now. I'm saying all of this I did have 20/20 vision just developed cataracs.

Cataract,Monofocal Lens Experiences?,"Hi All, I'm still in the decision stage on my left affected eye and I am wondering if some of you out there who've had monofocal lenses implanted could share your experiences with them? I'm looking to find out if there's any degree of intermediate and even reading distance vision you may have achieved with them and how you find them generally. Were you surprised after surgery how good your vision was? Did you have a less than expected experience? My father had both eyes done with monofocal lenses and he seems pretty happy with them and says he doesn't need glasses most of the time. He said he can even do crossword puzzles without glasses. Would love to hear your stories. Thanks. G"
Cataract,Causes of early onset cataracts ?,"Hi everyone, I've joined this community because I'm rather frustrated at not being able to know the cause for my bilateral cataracts.I'm female, 22 years old, caucasian, eat very healthily, don't smoke, rarely drink ...I noticed my first cataract in my right eye when I was 8 and messing around with winking. I was operated on the same year to replace my lens. My left eyesight was always excellent despite slight hypermetropia and it grew even stronger to compensate for the lesser capabilities of the artificial intra-ocular lens in my right eye.The difference in eyesight always gave me horrible headaches that I just had to deal with. I was prescribed reading glasses to help with those.Around 2-3 years ago I started noticing that my vision had globally deteriorated and as the months went by, I felt it was getting worse. When I started learning to drive in summer 2012 I realised I had trouble reading signposts and so I went to see my ophthalmologist, the same one who's been assigned me since my first operation (and who performed it). I was convinced somehow a cataract was developing in my left eye.He examined me and told me I had developed astigmatism in my left eye, but no signs of cataract. He prescribed me some new glasses, saying I would need to wear them constantly, especially when driving.Despite these glasses, I still had trouble reading signposts and progressively I started losing more vision, my left eyesight started to become ever so slightly foggy.I finally got an appointment a few days ago and the diagnosis was a second cataract, this time in my left eye.My Dr. was never able to tell me the cause of these cataracts, I find it very strange that they should appear at such a young age as well as 15 years apart.I've looked up potential causes and none seem to fit.I'm the type who likes to have an answer, I feel I need to know everything about me.Is it genetic ? Those usually present in infancy, not at my age ...Trauma to the eyes ? Not that I can remember.Exposure to radiation ? Overexposure to sunlight ? Nope, I'm light skinned, I stay away from the sun when possible.If it might be caused by some illness, I'd like to know about it but know one is able to give me answers.I probably sound whiny, and for that I apologise. I'm just dismayed at the news at the moment, cataracts shouldn't just pop up like this. I want to know why they did.If anyone has had a similar experience, I'd love to hear what your own doctors might have said. Or if anyone has a link or reference to some studies that might point to what I'm looking for.Thank you."
Cataract,Hydrophobic acrylic and dysphotopsia,"Hello all,few months ago I had implanted a very popular lens, a Tecnis ZCB00 monofocal.

And heard of this problem by many Acriysof lens patients, in many forums: side-flickering, edge glare.This lens is causing my very bad internal reflections, probably caused by the non-water material and its squared edges causing irritating internal reflections. I'm wondering if changing the lens with a high-water content hydrophilic lens with rounded edge could solve the problem. Anyone has similar issues?

Cataract,A question after my second surgery," So, I last posted a couple of weeks ago after my first lens replacement in my R eye. While the surgery went well, I was nervous because , post surgery,not only was my near vision bad ( I expected that) , but the intermediate vision as well. I saw an opthalmologist in the office , my vision in the right was 20/25, and my retina looked fine. I have a history of serous retinopathy, so multifocals were not an option for me. The ophthalmologist who saw me that day was not my surgeon, but he told me that it was common to have intermediate problems and that once my second eye was done, the eyes should balance out.Today, prior to my left eye lens replacement, my surgeon said"" we're going to correct for distance in this eye, right?"" I voiced my concerns, but we agreed to correct for distance.. The surgery went well. I realize that I am only 2 hours out, but I can still read fairly well (or at least see up close) with my left eye. The right (first) eye can still see well for distance.I looked at the replacement lens powers, the right is 16.5D, the left 18.5D. What does that mean? Did he end up giving me blended vision? If my left distance vision improves, and I can still read with my left eye, I will be thrilled.I truly appreciate any help in advance!I seem to remember s/p surgery on the right eye that the distance vision was pretty good right away, but then again the cataract in that eye was much more severe."
Cataract,Wearing glasses while adjusting to monovision,"So I've recently had surgery in both eyes (end Jan and mid Feb) and now have monovision with the left eye at 0 and the right eye at -2.25. So that's a fairly big difference between both eyes.Distance is great - no real problems except in low light situations when I notice the blurring from the right eye a bit more. No night halos or anything.Intermediate - not good but that was a compromise I was willing to make.Near - finding this more challenging than expected and more difficult than the trial I did with contact lenses. It's worse in low light. Keeping my close up vision was really important to me and so I'm finding it frustrating not being able to see properly close up given that my right eye is at -2.25 (prior to the surgery I could just take off my glasses to see close up).I know that fully adjusting to the monovision will take time (and I'm prepared to persevere) so I'm not complaining about it although I won't deny that it is a bit frustrating!What I want to know is whether wearing glasses during the adjustment period will negatively affect my ability to adjust.I got some computer glasses this week to help me with the intermediate as I have to work need to be able to see what's on my computer. I'm finding that the computer glasses also help me with the close up vision and it's tempting to use them instead of trying to see close up without them. Is this a bad thing to do for adjusting to monovision?I'm considering getting a pair of progressive glasses mainly for computer use but I want to be able to see clearly out the top of them (currently the top is blurred and I have to take them off to see clearly in the distance) and also so that I can read close up with them on. I would basically wear them all the time whilst on the computer (about 7 hours a day!). If I do this will it also negatively affect my ability to adjust properly to the monovision?Your thoughts and comments are much appreciated! "

Cataract,Seeing patial arc near outside of eye (ear side). ,"Hi! I had surgery on Friday at UCLA Jules Stein Eye Institute, the Femtosecond laser was used combined with astigmatism correction. Left eye was done for close-up vision. Couple of weeks ago, had the right one done for distance and it turned out excellent (monovision). Now, I can see a partial arc moving out of my lower left eye on the ear side. I'm left eye dominant. Very disturbing because it's also commingled with numerous, pre-existing floaters. Was told t looked fine and it's impossible for me to be seeing the edge of the implant, it may go away. If my brain fails to neuro adapt, it won't go away. Follow up visit was performed by a fellow, not the surgeon. Wondering if he could've missed a decentralized IOL or it's just light bouncing around the wrong way?

Cataract,Target vs actual refractive outcomes?,"I've been doing some research on target vs actual refractive outcomes after cataract surgery. It seems that most outcomes are within 1 (either plus or minus) of the target and around 50% are within 0.5 of the target.What I can't find is whether most were plus 1 or 0.5 or minus 1 or 0.5 from the target.So for example, if your surgeon was aiming for refractive outcome of -2.00 and you ended up with -1.50 then it was plus 0.5 from target and if you ended up with -2.50 then you were minus 0.5 from target.I want to find out if more people are coming out plus target or minus target but I can't find that information.I have to make a decision about my second eye (which I've finally decided after much agonising and changing of my mind to have slightly myopic so that I can have blended mini monovision for close and intermediate). Not sure what my right eye has come out at yet as it's only a week since I had it done - my surgeon aimed for near vision which is exactly what I have but I don't know what he actually aimed for in dioptres or what I actually have. I will ask at my check up tomorrow.I'm just curious to know if people ended up with plus or minus what the target was as that may give me some indication of what I may end up with in my second eye if there's a clear bias one way or the other.I'm trying to figure out if I ask my surgeon to try for -0.75 am I likely to end up at -0.50 or -1.00?"
Cataract,Cataract Surgery to have or not,I am almost 45 years young born with cataracts in both eyes hereditary in the females on my fathers side of the family it sometimes skipped generations.

Cataract,Cataract surgery ,"I have had cataract surgery in both eyes the past 8 weeks. I am so disappointed. I use to be able to see up close, but far away was not that great even though he said I was legally blind. I cannot see up close at all without some kind of glasses. (cheaters) I work on a computer all day and I loved to read and do crossword puzzles. Now my eyes are so tired wearing the glasses I have not picked up a book since I had this done. Is it possible to have surgery again and let me see close and need glasses just for far away. I even have a hard time cooking with the readers, but blurry without them cannot even cut up a tomato."
Cataract,Cost of symfony toric,"I am a 62 yr old male living in the USA. I need cater act surgery on both eyes and gave astigmatism in both. Mr eye care professional recomended the symfony toric. He said in 98 % of cases, no glasses will be needed except for fine print. While that sounds great, he wants an additional whopping fee of 3500.00 per eye! From what I have read elsewhere, this type of lens should be up to about 2500.00 per eye. That said, I was not savvy enough to ask if this surgery was laser assisted and if some of that cost was attributable to a ladik type surgery at the same time. Your thoughts are appreciated."

Cataract,Help with choice for second cataract surgery,"I think i have made a terrible mistake with my cataract surgery. I am 56 years old and have been mildly myopic with a rapidly progressing cataract in my right eye, and another in the left which is bad but not quite as severe.I have a history of central serous retinopathy in the right and for that reason was told I was not a good candidate for a multifocal lens. I had a monofocal distance lens placed in my right eye 4 days ago and noticed an immediate improvement in clarity; however I cannot see ANYTHING up close with the new lens. Fortunately, for now, my left eye allows me to see up close, although it is a bit uncomfortable. I truly cannot see up close with my right eye at all.I have been reading these forums and now wish I had gone with a more intermediate type lens, as I cannot imagine needing reading glasses for everything up close, and an inability to focus AT ALL very close. How do you drive and read the dashboard? I am now scheduled to have the other eye done in two weeks, and am going to wait ( I think) Will the near vision in my right eye improve? I realize that it has only been 4 days, and my pupil, for whatever reason, is still slightly dilated.What are my options? Can I use contacts?I do not like the idea of having one eye set for distance and the other for near vision. It is sort of what I have now and it is uncomfortable. Having said that, my far vision in the left eye is not horrible.In retrospect, I would rather have to wear glasses for distance and driving , than to not be able to see up close at all.Hopefully the eye will adjust, and I will at least be able to see ( if not read clearly) up close?Thanks in advance"
Cataract,A Few Questions: On the verge of getting a mono-focal lens,"Hi Everyone, New member here. I've been advised by an eye surgeon in London, UK that I'm best off (for now) getting a mono-focal lens in my left (bad) eye. He said that because my reading vision was quite good in my other (right) eye that by getting the mono-focal in the left the blended result would be quite good. I guess this is known as ""monovision"". I was surprised by that recommendation as my right eye is quite bad anyway..not from cataracts but from nearsightedness. I'm surprised he feels I could achieve a good outcome from having only the left eye done. Have member here heard of good outcomes via a monovision strategy? Lastly, he said he wouldn't be using femtolaser method to cut the incision but rather a blade. Is there much support to use the femtolaser in the case of monofocal lens? or is that overkill?Regards and thank you in advance. G "
Cataract,Glasses don't work after surgery! Why?,"I had surgery done on my right eye on Friday (set for near) - which is fantastic so far... I'll update my (hopefully positive) results once I've had the left eye (set for far) done on 9th Feb.Anyway, back to the glasses. So I took an old pair of glasses to the optician and had them put a clear lens in the right eye so I could use them whilst I wait for the left eye to be done. My left eye is -5.50 with astigmatism so I can't function with just one eye set for near.When I put the glasses on yesterday I couldn't see a thing! It was like putting on someone else's glasses. It wasn't quite double vision, but not far off. If I cover one eye at a time then I can see fine, but with both eyes everything is totally out of whack! Very annoying as I paid to have the lens replaced!Thankfully I can wear a contact lens in my left eye until the next surgery so I'm okay during the day, but when I get home from work I'd like to be able to take the contact lens out but I'm going to have to keep it in if I want to do anything meaningful in the evenings.Why has this happened? Anyone else have this problem?"
Cataract,Dominant Eye and Cataract Lens,"Hi Everyone, Fresh off a consultation with my eye doc/surgeon, I was given a couple of tests to determine my dominant eye. I guess this factors in (not sure how) to what type of lens I might get. His assistant handed me a little fake camera and told me to take a picture. I did and used my right eye to sight the viewfinder. So she concluded my dominant eye was my right. However, a bit later when the doc saw me, he asked me to sight an imaginary rifle. In that case, I used my left eye. I'm a bit cross dominant in a number of things... I used to play hockey right handed.. I golf right handed...but I bat left handed.. I write left handed. So I'm not even sure which eye is dominant. Ultimately my question is..""How does eye 'dominance' factor into lenses? Say, for example, in the case of mono-focal lenses.. Would the dominant eye be the one that should get the distance vision lens in a mono vision strategy?G "
Cataract,I am getting cataract surgery on the 21st of this month. ,I have Monovision and have worn glasses for over 30 years. I tried contacts for Mono vision but my eyes would never adjust. I do a lot of computer work so my eye doctor said he thought close up reg lenses would be good but I am having second thoughts and think I should get lenses for far away. Can anyone help me with this? I need to made a decision next week. I don't mind wearing my glasses for computer work. I have Monovision and have worn glasses for over 30 years.

Cataract,Best IOL?,"Hello everybody. Goal: I am planning to have having cataract surgery soon. My optimal goal is to have better distance vision without increasing halos/glare at night and without compromising too much of my current reading vision. Current Vision: My left side is -2.75 Sphere and -1.0 Cyl.My right side is -6.0 Sphere and -1.75 Cyl.Heath Issues: Both LASIK and PRK were out of the picture because my right eye has a very thin cornea. My left eye however, can do PRK. Currently, I have dry eye and night time driving is very difficult due to the glare which is sometimes reduced with my glasses. Questions: I am not sure as to which IOL lenses is the best for my case. I understand that there are three combinations possible(both monofocal lenses, one monofocal lense and one multifocal lense, and both multifocal lenses). One solution my surgeon presented me with is having both monofocal lenses implanted, however I am worried about the loss of depth perception: which is very limited at the time being. Both multifocal lenses to my understanding, would not allow for fully clear vision at all distances(near, intermediate, and far) in addition, halos and glare seem to be a major issue with multifocal lenses. This leads me to be quite unsure about one monofocal and one multifocal which seems to be the best for my case.Brands: For a monofocal lense, I was leaning towards with a Tecnis Symfony lense or a Softec HD lense. For multifocal lense, I was leaning towards TECNIS® Multifocal or AcrySof® IQ ReSTOR.Conclusion: If you could please include your age range, what type of lense you chose (monofocal or multifocal and brand), you current depth perception, the severity of night time halos/glares and any opinions you have in hindsight about your procedure would be greatly helpful to me.

Cataract,Hydrophobic acrylic iol glare?,"Anyone with a hydrophobic iol implanted (Tecnis, Acrysof ...) with annoying glare and flickering?"
Cataract,"Glare, Haze and Fog with lights","I had single vision Z9002 silicon lens done July 2017 and YAG done for PCO Dec 2017.I am scheduled for EPI PRK Feb 7 to fix over corrected Rx in lens surgically replaced. Now (+.5, +.75, with +2.5 for reader) Hate that.Here is my question.Dr recommends EPI PRK with new Allegretto Wavefront Ex500 machine. Says he can dial in Rx correct to 0 on both eyes for distance. He said recovery is about a week. 3-4 days of temp lens while cornea heals. So yes recovery stinks. Anyway.I did have YAG done in Dec and did help with stars and some of the glare or haze around lights.However, now very strange that lights far way have very little halo. Lights 40-100 feet have a large glare, especially those pinkish orange street lights; about 10-20 foot radius fog around the light! Also when I am behind a car stopped at night I do notice VERY SMALL concentric rings (makes a halo) around most brake lights. (Lens Construction?) Also Florescent lights cause a flicker/glare. SOOO....MY opinion is that the silcon Z9002 lens that are wrong Rx are causing the refraction and glare in them some how. Could that be possible? I had one comment by Phys Asst, that wrong Rx can cause the glare. So Feb 7 I am scheduled for the EPI PRK and hope that helps with less glow around lights...thoughts? Since July 2017, this has been a long endurance for better vision. "
Cataract,Cataract surgery following LASIK surgery --- bad result.,"LASIK surgery some 25 years ago -- cataracts recently developed in both eyes. Can't obtain LASIK records (lost by hospital). Had cataract surgery on right eye - long distance lens. Great vision for 5 days, then drastically deteriorated, pain, double vision, watery discharge,feeling that something in the eye, floaters, now short sighted in this eye, vision worse than before surgery. What is so frustrating is that the vision seems to vary during the day. Can look at an object using only that eye and it will be in focus, a few minutes later when I look again it will be blurred. Am seeing consultant again in a few weeks but he maintains as correct measurements as possible of eye pre surgery were taken, can't expect perfect result because of prior LASIK surgery. But,having had a long sighted lens inserted I certainly didn't expect to end up shortsighted and with worse vision than prior to surgery.He has proposed piggybacking another lens on top of the existing lens to see if this improves vision and/ or laser treatment to break up floaters which he says are causing distortion of vision and due to dry eyes!. I'm not convinced and concerned piggybacking another lens will make feeling of something in eye worse.I'd be interested in hearing from anyone who's had a similar experience and/ or received further treatment to address similar sight problems.LASIK surgery some 25 years ago -- cataracts recently developed in both eyes.

Cataract,PanOptix (and tri-focals IOLs in general) - Any experiences?,"Hi, I am considering PanOptix tri focal IOL. I have searched the discussion forums but haven't come across any posts sharing their experiences with PanOptix or tri-focals in general. I'm guessing its not yet approved for use in the US and that may be why there aren't many comments re PanOptix. I live in Canada where it is available (and recommended as one of the options by my ophthalmologist).I have reviewed some of the studies available on PubMed Health that compare various tri-focals (studies run my mostly EU ophthalmologists). The gist of these studies seems to be that all tris are similar although one of the studies ranks PanOptix slightly better at 66 and 50cm. Studies are great but without being specific, some studies may be sponsored and others don't have a large enough sample size.I'm interested in hearing from readers of this forum who have had PanOptix implanted and if they could share their personal experiences. My specific questions relate to:- contrast (how's your contrast sensitivity with and without glare?)- halos (how bad are the halos, do the halos at night affect the quality of vision?)- vision quality in dim light (one of the studies mentioned the PanOptix lets more light through to retina compared to some other diffractive lenses, what's the real-life experience in indoor dim and very bright outside light?)- Brain time (how quickly were you able to adjust to the tri-focal IOL?)- Complications/issues (did you experiences any post-operative issues?Thanks!"
Cataract,Glare problemsI have heard that various coatings can be applied to spectacles to counteract this pro,since having cataract and capsulotomy operations some five years ago I have suffered glare problems.

Cataract,Symfony vs Restor 2.5D,"Hello:I'm a few weeks away from making my IOL selection (and about 8 weeks before surgery) and I'm going back and forth between the low-add Restor 2.5D (my surgeon's choice), Symfony (mainly due to this forum), and a monofocal IOL coupled with a multi-focal contact (I'm currently trialing multifocal contacts in my left eye where the cataract doesn't yet affect my vision). What I'm finding is that there are almost no patient reviews of the Restor 2.5D (although plenty for the 3 and 4 version) while there are hundred of posts like the numerous ones on this forum regarding the Symfony.There are many clinical studies but many of these are sponsored and I was hoping to hear comments from more patients who actually had this Restor. What I'm expecting is comparable distance vision to Symfony and more of a peak at the intermediate range and slightly lower contrast sensitivity. I'm also expecting small and prominent halos (Restor) vs less prominent but larger concentric rings (Symfony). My main thought here is that these are both popular lens choices so why am I not able to find more than a handful of patient comments on the Restor 2.5D? I tend to feel that people seek out forums like this and post their comments when they have had issues with the product but rarely when everything is fine. Could it be that there just aren't a lot of problems with this newer Restor? Looking in detail at the literature it's nor purely just a lower-add version of their prior product, it seems like many of the design choices were made specifically to improve distance/contrast and reduce the effects of halos. I'm hoping that someone on this board has the Restor 2.5 and can comment or, alternatively, found some actual patient reviews that you can direct me to. I have found blogs and other posts from surgeons and have not found a single one who isn't happy with the new Restor but I have found a few who aren't happy with the Symfony. Although, I can't help but wonder if this is partly due to familiarity with the type of lens, with Synfony being a rather different and new product.Any comments or research anyone else has found? Thanks in advance. "
Cataract,Posterior Sub Capsular Cataract,"41 and diagnosed with posterior sub capsular cataract in both eyes. I have one parent who had cataract surgery in the 40s.The vision in only the left eye is blurred. The prescription can be altered to imrpove clarity but cannot be altered enough to be 20/20 but the haziness and shadow go away.My successful 20/20 test on the left eye was on 3/31 this year. I have never had my eyes dilated before so have never known if there has been a cataract in there.1. Are these kind of contacts reparable or does the capsule that holds the lens gets damaged?2. Should I try to ride this out as much as I can?3. My parent did have the retina detach after YAG, 7 years after the catarcat surgery. Can retina detachment be repaired if it is cause by YAG?4. Is is correct, that me under 50 have higher risk of retina detachment?My appointment with surgeon is next week so he may have answers to these questions. Until then I am losing my mind and seeking thoughts. "
Cataract,Eye discomfort after cataract surgery,I had cataract surgery five days ago. On taking the dressing off the next day my vision was brilliant and no discomfort.On the morning of the third day (Saturday) it felt as if I had something in the outside corner of my eye and that the clarity of vision was somewhat less. As it didn't wear off I called the out of hours ophthalmic nurse. She first asked me to check for an eyelash or anything in the eye. Her second suggestion was that I could have a sensitivity to the cheapo NHS eye drops with preservative in them.We agreed to leave the situation until after applying the next eye drops. Things were no better when she called me back. She offered to get the on call eye doctor to see me at the hospital.I did not feel that it was urgent enough for that and that I would leave it until today ( Monday)The discomfort worsened over night and I called the daytime contact number. They took my details and will pass them on to the eye clinic and someone will call me back...but it might not be today.The feeling is rather like when many years ago I wore contact lenses and I put one in wrongly.Has any other reader had the same sensation?

Cataract,Focus on Halos and Glare,"Seems like many of us have had issues with halos and glare of some sort from single or multi focal, acrylic and silicon. So I am wondering if lens sizing contributes to the issues.For example say my full dilated pupil size is 8mm, yet surgeon installs a 6mm lens. Thus in low light, variable lighting, night situations some of the light is passing through no corrected portion of my capsule. Thus some very blurry vision is mixed into edges of the sharp vision. CAUSING Halos..and ditto for glare. I have been researching Lasik and PRK cornea correction diameters as a cause of halos from those surgeries. Could same issue with cataract lens size occur in capsul-back side of cornea, from inner replaced lens sizing problem?"
Cataract,Epiretinal membrane after laser cataract surgery,"i had cataract surgery on both eyes 2 years ago. I developed pco in both and have had yag on both eyes.

It has affected my near and far vision and you can’t correct it with glasses.

Cataract,My experience of the Symfony Toric lens,"I have been short-sighted and astigmatic for most of my life. Finally cataracts meant an operation. Before the operation my myopia was -12.50 (right) and -11.00 (left), astigmatism -6 (right) and -4 (left). I agreed to have a Symphony Toric lens - ZXT375 - and this was inserted into my right eye four days ago.My vision began to recover from the anaesthesia after a few hours. Other than a dull ache - which lasted no more than 24 hours, there has been little pain. I have been prescribed antibiotic and anti-inflammatory drops four times a day for the next month. I did not expect that this lens would allow me to read without glasses and (at the moment) it looks like my expectations will be proved right. I have previously experienced halos around car headlights and this is unchanged. In addition I can now see starbursts around some street lights.I removed the right hand lens from my glasses after the surgery but, having worn them for a short time, found the distortion to be too great. Other than for reading, the vision in my right eye is so much better than it was when I was wearing glasses. For the first time in over 60 years I can walk around without them - though I have to be very careful about judging distances on my left.The clarity, the light and the colours I experience with my enhanced right eye are nothing short of remarkable.Will update this in about 10 days"

I have used over 12 different types of eyes drops and as many as 19 in a day for abut a month. I have halos and bursting and night driving can be a nightmare. I don't go out any more than I have to. In fact for 53 days I didn't drive at all for fear of hitting something or someone. I had to depend on others to take me anywhere I needed or wanted to go. I have been diagnosed with Excessive Dry Eyes. Map Dot fingerprinting Dystropy. Never having this much trouble with my eyes till having the cataract and laser surgery which later found out they both cause drying of the eyes and scarring. I just this pass Monday had plugs put into my tear ducts hoping this will help my excessive dry eyes. I am loss for words, frustrated and have spent about $1000.00 out of my pocket for the multi-function lens.---thinking I wouldn't need glasses. Everything is worse. Sorry I will have to finish this later have to get my grand-daughter. Also abut $500.00 on drops which Medicare doesn't cover. "
Cataract,Cataracts,"I have been diagnosed with cataracts by an optometrist. When I saw a specialist it turned out I also had a macular hole, which was operated on straight away. The cataracts were not too bad, but would quickly get worse because of the surgery. My problem is that my eyesight has improved to what it was about 30 years ago, still need glasses for reading, but no longer for driving. I know the macular surgery would improve my eyesight but I can't believe it could improve to this degree. I have read somewhere that cataract symptoms can include temporary improvement.

Cataract,What exactly do you see with Symphony IOL,"Hi, thanks for everyone's help with my previous discussion.I am 47 with cataracts in my right eye only. Both eyes have myopia around -6D. I read so much about the halos and starbursts at night, but I wonder what exact is being seen though the Symphony at day time. I am debating if I should put monofocal or Symphony on the right eye. Left eye will be contact lens until it got cataracts too.1) For things in the center of gaze, did you see a sharp image overlapped with multiple ""blurry"" images? From what I have heard your brain will learn to tune out those ""blurry images"" from the wrong focal distance and only recognize the sharpest image. Is that true for far and intermediate distances at least up to say up to 2 feet?2) Now how about the peripheral vision in day time. Are the peripheral images distorted in any way, wrapped, multiple rings, etc? How do you compare your peripheral vision with Symphony against a normal, non-cataract eye?3) Now for night vision, did anyone knows if any images or video exists to show examples of what halos and starbursts vision looks like? How far does those halo extents out from the light source? What are starbursts? 4) How about dim, indoor condition. For example, in a concert hall with limited lighting (like in a piano concert, where you almost wanted to turn on the flash light from your phone to read the program). How about in the Movie theater where the screen is bright and everything else is dark?THank you so much. "
Cataract,NHS cataract surgery - my positive outcome.,Having glaucoma and high myopia [-13.5] I understood the risk of complications. And that’s what I got with my left eye. A posterior capsule tear left retained lens fragments and a loss of vitreous humour. And the following day very high eye pressure caused temporary blindness. Emergency treatment improved things and a vitrectomy completely removed all the fragments and unwanted vitreous humour. Shortly afterwards I had wonderful distance vision. The right eye surgery went perfectly and I returned home with clear vision.Between operations I had to cope with poor vision in my right eye. But I just put up with it. My one good eye gave me better vision compared with what I was experiencing prior to surgery.Off the shelf reading glasses are providing excellent close up vision.I am very happy with my NHS treatment despite the complications. They were rapidly and satisfactorily dealt with.And like countless others I now enjoy wonderful distance vision without glasses which I had worn for nearly 70 years.Happy new year everyone!
Cataract,Which IOL lense?,"Hello everybody. [u]Goal[/u]I am planning to have having cataract surgery soon. My optimal goal is to have better distance vision without increasing halos/glare at night and without compromising too much of my current reading vision. [u]Current Vision[/u]My Rx Sphere for my left side is -2.75 and -6.0 for the right.My Rx Cyl. for the right side is -1.0 and -1.75 for the right.Heath IssuesBoth LASIK and PRK were out of the picture because my right eye has a very thin cornea. My left eye however, can do PRK. Currently, I have dry eye and night time driving is very difficult due to the glare which is sometimes reduced with my glasses. [u]Questions[/u]I am not sure as to which IOL lenses is the best for my case. I understand that there are three combinations possible(both monofocal lenses, one monofocal lense and one multifocal lense, and both multifocal lenses). One solution my surgeon presented me with is having both monofocal lenses implanted, however I am worried about the loss of depth perception: which is very limited at the time being. Both multifocal lenses to my understanding, would not allow for fully clear vision at all distances(near, intermediate, and far) in addition, halos and glare seem to be a major issue with multifocal lenses. This leads me to be quite unsure about one monofocal and one multifocal which seems to be the best for my case.[u]Brands[/u]For a monofocal lense, I was leaning towards with a Tecnis Symfony lense or a Softec HD lense. For multifocal lense, I was leaning towards TECNIS® Multifocal or AcrySof® IQ ReSTOR.[u]Conclusion[/u]If you could please include your age range, what type of lense you chose(monofocal or multifocal and brand), you current depth perception, the severity of night time halos/glares and any opinions you have in hindsight about your procedure would be greatly helpful to me. Thank you to everyone who has commented or read about my situation."
Cataract,Can you still see a full moon?,Thought of this last night. I’m having surgery in a couple hours. I guess it’s too late now. LOL. Does the Synfony Lens implant make it impossible to ever look at a full moon again due to halos????Mike
Cataract,Monofocal(Monovision) or Multifocal for tennis/badminton,"Hi, I have cataract in my dominate eye and would probably need surgery in a few months. My other eye has myopia about -6D but no cataract so far. I could not decided if Monofocal or Multifocal is best for me. One big question for me is that I would like to keep playing racket sports after the surgery. The ball will be coming from the opposite court (far distance) to within a few feet very quickly and I need to sight the ball clearly to time my swing. Any double or fuzzy vision is a definitely no-no. I don't play professionally but I still wanted to play good (not playing with grand kids just yet, I am 47). My questions are1) Will monovision with monofocal IOL provide enough depth of view in the intermediate range for me to judge distance and time my shots?2) Will multifocal IOLs distort the ball too much? I need more than seeing a ""clear"" image of the ball, I will need to see if it is spinning, wobbling and gauge its incoming speed in split seconds.Thank you very much."
Cataract,Cataract Lens choices,"Hi, I'm about to undergo cataract surgery in about a month and pondering what lens to use.Would appreciate any suggestion for my situation.I'm 61 and has been nearsighted since youth. My eye prescription is as follows: -6.0, -0.75, +2.5-6.5, DS, +2.5So I'm quite nearsighted on both eyes, slightly astigmatism on my right eye, and moderate presbyopia on both eyes. I've been wearing progress glassed for the last ~10 yrs. The cataract doctor was pretty sure that Sympony lens is most suitable for me. The main reason he mentioned is Symfony lens has the best chance of allowing me not needing glasses after surgery.The thing is I don't really mind wearing glasses. My main goal after surgery is to be able to see well in all distances even if I have to wear glasses. The research I have on Symphony is it may give me good distance vision without glasses but monitor and reading may be borderline acceptable. Here are my questions:1. Would it be a good idea that the Symphony lens is set to optimize intermediate and near visions? The distance visions then become borderline acceptable, meaning I can still function without glasses but if I want to sharpen up I wear glasses. So the end result is I will wear glasses to correct mild nearsightedness most of the time but remove glasses when reading monitor and books.2. Can the above scenario be achieved with standard monofocal lens? Sympony lens is expensive.Thanks in advance, Robert "
Cataract,4 weeks post-op. I thought I would post a positive comment for a change.,"I'm 4 weeks post-op with my second cataract procedure and I have excellent results with both. I will need reading glasses but my distance vision is crystal clear. I do have a slight distortion in my 'new eye' but it's getting better daily and with both eyes open it's gone! I must say that I am bothered slightly more than pre-op by flourecent lights and bright sunshine but I've got some gorgeous non-prescription sunglasses that I can now actually wear. I did have scar tissue build up after maybe 3 months with my first cataract removal 2 years ago, but my consultant fixed it with laser treatment within a week (and I live in the UK!) and my sight returned to normal immediately.Cataracts cause eventual blindness, so for me to question whether to have the operation is a no brainier, I would have it done.

Cataract,Flickering and flashes in eyes after combined surgery,"2 years after receiving both vitrectomy and cataract surgery to both my eyes (operations performed 2 weeks apart), I am still experiencing distressing symptoms of flickering and flashing of all light sources.A further result from my surgery is double vision. Is there anyone out there with any of these symptoms following this kind of surgery?I have been told that the implanted lenses may be capturing the light on the edges of the lenses and that could be one of the problems, the othere possible caue is that the implanted lenses are not entirely stable and are vibrating. these combined problems cause dizzyness nausea and light sensitivity. After 2 years I am so tired of the flickering, if there is anyone out there who has a solution, i would love to hear it."

Cataract,About to have Cataract Surgery - A Few Quick Questions,"The plan is right eye on 12/11 and left eye a week later. Alcon monodical lenses will be used. The targeted diopters after surgery is -1.00D(right eye) and -1.75D(left), or mini-monovision for near/intermediate. Before surgery, I'm 6.0/6.5 myopic and very slight astigmatism. Questions:1. The surgeon said if I can stay motionless well, she may just apply topical anesthesia. How difficult is it to stay motionless during surgery? Do you sit down or lay down during surgery? Is recovery easier if applying only topical anesthesia?2. The surgeon said I could change my mind to monovision for distance/intermediate after first eye is done(right eye). This is because I'm quite myopic and the resulting diopter may vary quite a bit from the targeted -1.00D(even though ORA will be used). My dominant eye is right eye. In monovision, does it matter which eye is which for vision length? "
Cataract,Progressive Lenses After Cataract Surgery,"I recently had cataract surgery in both eyes. Prior to the surgery I wore progressive lenses, and knew I would have to wear them after the surgery as well. The corrections done during the surgery were for far vision and an astigmatism. Everything was progressing well until four days ago when I began getting terrible headaches. I think the problem has been caused because my refraction appointment is in 10 days--my eyes need to heal before this visit--and I'm having vision problems related to using a pair of cheap reading glasses (with the prescription my opthmalogist gave me) for close vision, and a second pair (different prescription) for mid-range vision.I wonder if anyone else has had this problem."

Cataract,"3 rd day of my cataract surgery, any one experienced edema?","This is a 3rd day of my cataract lazer surgary, monofocal best distance like the one i have at the left.My vision is still blurry, feel like seeing things under water on the right eye. I know i need to give more time to settle.Yesterday dr said while checking he mentioned there is edema present now,. and he said that he spent a lot of energy to clean up densed cataract and he did spend lot of energy to clean up. Water was pouring down in to my side of my face to my neck and soaked my back of my shirt. I also chased lazer Because of the dance cataract.He did not say what type of edema. And he will see me again After the lazer (to brake up the cataract and put the cuts) i waited around 15 minuets to go to the surgary room there another 15 Minuits and the prep continues eye drops. cleanup and thr lense insertation took more than 20 minuets. ( nurse was saying he wa doing another procedure on another person and will be back to my 2end prosediure it is a very busy clinic indeed.)I checked about the edema on line it could happen of leaking capillaries after cataract surgery. I had densed cataract on the other eye also. I was able to see right away 20/20 right after the surgary 18 months ago.I am worried this messy liquid may reduce my other clear vision slowly.I don't want to loose the good vision in the left eye i have now due to this right eye edema.Reading and typing is not.

Cataract,Radioactive Iodine treatment and Cataract Surgery TIMING!,"Hi All,I am scheduled for surgery Jan 8 for one eye and then Jan 15 for the other. And of course the doctor wanted to paid in advance for the non-covered charges.I am having my follow up nuclear medicine scan after thyroid surgery last January for thyroid cancer. I had radioactive iodine treatment last February. I ran into the office scheduler from my Endocrinologist's office at my Pick Up the Radioactive Pill (low dose used for the scan) appointment and she told me my Endocrinologist wants me to stay off the Synthroid until all the blood work is back. Yes very tired. LOL.I am need another radioactive (high dose pill) treatment and thus in a quandary about the timing. I'd hate to cancel my surgery date, but am concerned about the effects on the proper healing of the eye after surgery if I go ahead with the Radioactive iodine treatment say a month later or two or even three.

Cataract,"Post-Surgical Cataract Outcomes -- ""Results Only"" Thread","I noticed many on this forum are looking for actual results from various lens choices, but it is sometimes difficult to sift through all the discussions. Thought I’d start a thread for patients to post their post-op data without too much additional conversation (there may be a few questions, obviously) so it might be easier to navigate. Some useful info. to post:1) What distance(s) were you targeting?(Far/Intermediate/Near/All) 2) Type of IOL (monofocal, multifocal/EDOF, toric, etc., including brand if you wish) 3) Post-op Rx (at least the SPH number in diopters) 4) What do you see clearly, and what situations and/or for what distance(s) do use or need glasses or contacts? 5) Additional Comments (e.g. Is the outcome what you expected? Are there residual artifacts? Anything you wish you had known pre-op? Did you have additional correction such as lasik? Happy with monovision? etc.)Probably best if at least 6-8 week post-op.

Cataract,Symfony Lens results at 3 months,"Just came from seeing my regular optometrist as I did want a baseline and know where I wound up after cataract surgery. Right eye was operated on in July and left was done late August. Both eyes had regular Symfony lenses implanted. Although I don’t understand all the numbers here is my current prescription. Optometrist said my eyes healed well. Looking at the pics of eyes when cataracts present vs today was significantly different. Whereas before the optic nerves were faint they stood out clear today. No sign of any PCO yet.Here is my prescription: SPH. CYL. AXISOD PL -025 105OS PL -050 65ADDOD +150OS. +150I am assuming the SPH at PL stands for plano. Distance chart I could read the 20/15 line with both eyes. The right eye sees better distance than a the right. Could read J1 (the smallest print for reading.) With reading with the add lens she tested with the contrast was a bit better and if I was reading in lower light or a novel for a length of time reading glasses would help. Optometrist was surprised with the results as most patients she sees after multifocal lens implants the patients aren’t happy with the results and complain of the glare. She said maybe it’s due to my younger age or I got lucky. She wishes more surgeons would implant these in their own eyes so they would know. She isn’t a fan of premium lenses and I remember she did try and discourage me from getting them. All in all since exam was end of day I am obviously pleased with these results.So for those of you better at interpreting these numbers I am wondering if I should get glasses or hold off? Do eyes tend to rely on glasses more for reading once you get glasses? Optometrist mentioned that prescriptions after cataract surgery if they change, change within first year.Thanks for your input. Appreciate everyone’s support through this."
Cataract,Cataract Symptoms,What cataract symptoms did you have?And how soon did your second eye get affected. Mine are distorted vision that cannot be corrected. Both near and far.

Cataract,After cataract surgery , I had cataract surgery on my right eye 10 weeks ago. I now suffer ghosting and some blurring with distance vision. I also suffer from a constant headache. I have spoken to a consultant and he says the surgery was healing fine and my eye is very healthy. He has said I have some viscoelastic material behind the implant which is normally absorbed by the body and this may be the cause of my problems. He has suggested a YAG capsulotomy to possibly get rid of it. He has warned me of the risks and said my vision could even worsen.Has anyone had this laser for this reason? I can only find examples of it being used for clouding of the lens. I would really appreciate comments - thank you.
Cataract,I'm 29 and have uniliteral cataract - help needed,"Hi,First of all I want to say I did my best to keep this post as short as possible. If any crucial info is missing please let me know and I'll provide necessary data. Secondly - it would be great if you could help me out or point my actions into the right direction.Ok, so let's start:---------------------I'm 29 yrs old and I live in Poland (Europe). I'm software developer (so a lot of work at intermediate distance). About year and a half ago I noticed that vision in my left eye have worsen. I thought it was due to being tired, but it eventually turned out to be a cataract. It think it's developing fast - I'm not totally blind on this eye but vision is so blurred I can't read with it, so all the work is done by my right eye.I've visited (so called) professional eye clinic in my country March this year, been there like 3-4 times since then (I had some questions and doubts) and eventually arranged cataract treatment on the 1st of December, 2015. But the more I read about IOLs and cataract the more I feel I was mistreated at this clinic as far as being informed well by doctors:- I've visited 3 different doctors: 1st recommended multiofocal, 2nd recommended toric multiofocal (I have 1.2 diopter astigmatism) and 3rd recommended multiofocal (without toric) again. But OK - different doctors, different approaches.- I haven't thought of that until I start reading more about cataract but none of the doctors asked me about my expectations regarding treatment OR about my lifestyle. Just ""I recommend multifocal"".- Regarding IOLs: what I've found strange they all were using just term ""multifocals"" - not bi-, tri- just multi. I'm going to call them today or tomorrow to ask which one they're planning to use, but my bet is it's going to be bifocal. And as far as I know it's not so good for intermediate distance. What is also a little bit weird it's even hard to find which IOLs they're using. I've found in some deeply buried FAQ on their website they're using Alcon and AMO IOLs.As for now I think I'm going to give them a call and ask about the IOL but to be honest I am leaning toward cancelling the treatment and check out another clinic. I've found one that offers new Alcon Acrysof Panoptix IQ (trifocal). But I would really like to know what you think first.Here are some questions/doubts that I still have:1. Monofocal vs Multifocal? The more I read the less great mutlifocal seem to be. Not that they're bad, but all this reading about halos, poor contrast, explantation in some cases got me worried. On the other hand I really would like to do without glasses/contacts. I mean I can live with using glasses for computer related work, but other than that I'd prefer not having to use them.a) Which one would you choose in regard to my age and fact that my second eye is healthy?b) Is it possible that when going with bifocal I still won't need glasses/contacts because my second eye is OK?2. Toric or not? I have no idea should I go with toric IOL or not - as mentioned earlier I have about 1.2 diopter astigmatism in the left eye.3. What else should I know / ask my doctor about before surgery?Thank you for taking time to read my post and sorry for it being somewhat lengthy.Best Regards,?Kris"

Cataract,Black line after cataract surgery ,I had cataract surgery 2 days ago. It was on my left eye. That day things were wonderful until evening. I have long dark hair and it seemed as if it were hanging beside the outside corner of my eye. Turns out it’s not hair but a curved line. Am wondering if anyone else has had this? And if it will go away? At my eye DR appointment the next day she said I would get used to it. Grrrr I didn’t want to trade on evil for another.
Cataract,Light adjustable lenses (LAL),"Let's discuss these lenses that are under investigation by the FDA and which could be a new breakthrough in customized vision at all distances after cataract surgery.. The lenses have been in development since 1996 by Calhoun Vision (recently renamed to RxSight). The lenses are IOLs made of a silicone polymer material that reacts to ultraviolet light to change the power of the implanted IOL to provide optimal vision at near, intermediate and distance in a non-invasive manner - without the need for contact lenses or spectacles.

Cataract,Cataract surgery and exercise,My husband had his cataract removed in his lt eye. Everything is going well and it will 4 weeks next Monday. He still has not got his post op appointment which was supposed to be at 2 to 3 weeks. When I phoned they still do not know when he will be seen. He wants to know whether he can resume his jogging. Have told him to wait after appointment but it is not likely to be soon. Anybody know whether he can start jogging also is it safe if he gets water in his eye. He is still having the maxidex drops for another week 4 times a day. Thanks
Cataract,What is the difference between posterior polar and posterior sub capsular cataract?,Posterior polar has risk of capsule damage during the surgery due to adhesion of opacity to the capsule. Is this the same as posterior sub capsular cataract?
Cataract,IC-8 IOL,Has anyone heard of this IOL? Seems to use pin hole effect to provide extended depth of focus. The surgeon that I saw has already implanted it in someone in El Salvador. 
Cataract,M plus X = Best(e),"November 9, I finally had the last cataract operated on. Now both eyes have the ""Oculentis Mplus X"" multifocal IOL implanted. The vision is superb!!! Near (7-12 inches), intermediate (12-16 inches) and distance vision is excellent. Night vision is better than when I wore eyeglasses (R: -700/L: -850 & progressive). There are no halos, streaks or glare from light sources. In fact it's interesting to look at the car and motorcycle headlights to see the lighting design -- single or multiple bulbs, LED, etc. I never did this wearing eyeglasses because the glare was too offending. Colors are incredible! It's like viewing a ""Sony Bravia"" flat screen tv during your waking hours. Lentis claims 5% light loss. It's acceptable to me because my night vision is very good. Before I was blind as a bat if I wasn't wearing my eyeglasses. Now my vision is at least 20/40 -- good enough for driving.I don't think the Oculentis Mplus X is available in North America. It's an excellent multifocal IOL with very good light sensitivity. I wore eyeglasses for 60 years and now I'm eyeglasses independent. Hurray! Lentis Mplus X has given me a visual reincarnation. It's the Best(e)!Has anyone else had great results with Oculentis IOL's?"
Cataract,Cataract Surgery Incision and Post-Op Antibiotics/Steroids,"Is the incision from cataract surgery visible after the operation? Where is it located, just above the iris? Does the cut/scar disappear as it heals over a few weeks/months?Regarding the post-op series of antibiotics and steroids, most take many drops per day for weeks after the surgery. But there are a few doctors I've read about that avoid all that trouble by injecting a special mixture into the eye one time during the surgery that last for weeks so no eye drops are needed by the patient. Has anyone gotten this ""dropless"" intracameral injection of antibiotics/steroids approach for cataract surgery instead of having to take lots of eyedrops per day for weeks?"
Cataract,"Abrupt cataract surgery during ICL surgery,now I am so depressed","I am 25 years old. I've been wearing glasses since childhood with both myopia and quite a bit of astigmatism. Now that I've reached my mid-20's I decided to undergo vision correction surgery and decided to go with the ICL implantable lens surgery. The surgery was scheduled for yesterday and something unexpected happened during the process: my doctor said he suddenly discovered cataracts in my right eye around the periphery of my lens and he asked me if it was okay to undergo instant cataract surgery,just like that! I was lying down helpless with my eye already numb and feeling dizzy and said yes,since I large. He said that from what he sees he suspected I will have to undergo cataract surgery in less than 10 years time and it was better for me to do it now since then I wouldn't have to undergo surgery again. For my other left eye he just performed the ICL surgery as scheduled. After the surgery I found that for my right eye which underwent catarct surgery, I could see almost clearly for some distance but virtually nothing up close; reading a book is unimaginable for me at the moment. The doc said this was something that comes with cataract surgery and that it will improve over time, especially if I get used to seeing closeup with my other eye. But this is a total disaster for me! I am only 25, and I hadn't felt ANY issues of cataracts affecting my vision whatsoever. I only found out that cataract surgery involves replacing your natural lens with another one and that different types such as single or multifocal lenses exist, AFTER the surgery had finished by googling. All I wanted was a perfectly simple ICL surgery,not some surgery that takes out my perfectly working natural lens thanks to which I now can't read anything up close and it isn't even reversible.Okay enought with the ranting..Will someone here be able to tell me if this problem of not being able to read up close with my cataract eye will likely improve over time, especially considering my young age? I'm guessing the lens I got implanted is the monofocal one with sight set to distance,since I can't see anything up close. Any other tips or suggestions will be appreciated..I am a web developer and use my laptop alot so I am very worried...Thanks in advance"

Cataract,Anyone transition from multifocal contacts before cataracts to multifocal IOL?,"Hello:I am 50 and having cataract surgery in February. I've read what I could on this issue (and this forum) and based on advice in this forum, I decided that I'd trial multifocal contact lenses before cataract surgery. I am fortunate in that the cataract in my left eye does not yet affect my vision (only in the right eye) so I figured it was worth taking this step to 1) determine if my brain could possibly adapt to simultaneously having multiple focal points and 2) see if I could potentially go with a monofocal IOL (for distance) coupled with a multifocal contact (distance plus intermediate) or if I should stick with my original plan to go with a low-add multifocal IOLI started a lens trial on Monday and I adjusted to the multifocal contacts within a day or so and the results are quite good. I chose an intermediate ADD to approximate what I’d end up with in terms of a multifocal IOL. My distance isn’t fantastic but I think that might be a fit issue. It’s not bad but not nearly as sharp as with my prior contacts. However, my intermediate distance is fantastic. If I could get a little sharper distance, I’d be very satisfied with this setup. I’m curious about others who did use mutifocal contacts before surgery and then went with multifocal IOL’s. I’d be using the Restor 2.5D for what it’s worth and here are my questions:1) Was the loss in contrast/low-light detail comparable between the two? I’m fine with the slight loss I have experienced with these lenses but not sure if the loss with the IOL would be more.2) I think I understand the differences in the types of halos endemic to multi-focal IOL’s (vs other types) due to the 2 distinct focus points and that a distance point light source should produce a specific type of halo that would be central spot of light with a gap and then a ring of light around this. I could not come up with a situation that would induce this artifact. Perhaps that was due to the specific lens design. I did notice added glare and more of a “blob” look to light sources, with LED headlights and street lights being the worst. However, the size of these “blobs” were small enough that I didn’t feel it impacted my overall vision too much and I’d easily make this trade to get back useable intermediate vision. I drove in a dense urban setting, away from the city and during rain and I was always able to identify people and other objects sufficiently in all cases. I did rotate back and forth between lenses and glass and this effect was definitely due to the contacts. Is there a specific type of multifocal contact (brand/model) which would be more likely to create similar halos to the multifocal IOL’s.3) Were you able to achieve excellent distance vision with the IOL and was this better than what you could achieve with the contacts?4) I noticed no discernable dropoff in vision between maybe 24 inches and 10 ft. I’m assuming that this is due to some accommodation left in my natural lens and that I will notice a dip with the IOL (assuming my near point is targeting 24” for best focus). Does this seem accurate?5) Any other thoughts or things I should test? I’m using Acuvue 1-Day Moist Multifocal lenses now and these are center near, so maybe not as close of an effect to what I could get to the IOL? My optometrist is happy to let me trial as many lenses as I wish over the next few months.Overall I’m pretty optimistic as I know that a monofocal IOL coupled with a multifocal contact should give me a good result. I kind of like the option of being able to remove the contact, for example before an extended drive, if needed. Thanks."

Cataract,Cataract surgery,"After having both cataracts removed some months ago, I expected my vision would settle. My optician explained that my brain was trying to adjust and it may take some time. However although I can see well after surgery I have smaller pupils than before, also I have a strange sensation in my head because I have the sensation of something in the way of my prorifal vision. It's very difficult to describe. It's a little like 'looking. Through binoculars' or a wide tunnel. I feel spaced out and weird in my head. It's worse indoors and on dull days.

Cataract,Monofocal IOL (Intermediate) + Extended wear contact lenses y,"This site has really been helpful. I’m 50 and scheduled for surgery on my right eye in February with my left eye about 6 weeks later. I was all set to go with a low-add multifocal (Restor 2.5D), until I found this site and have been reading about peoples’ experiences (good and bad) with multifocals and the Symfony extended range IOL’s. I’m now re-thinking my lens choice and instead considering a monofocal set for intermediate distance (around 24”, but 18” to 32” would be my ideal range) coupled with a contact lens for distance. Most of the discussions and literature reference the need for glasses or sometimes glasses/contacts, but I feel the experience of wearing contacts is very different from glasses and I’m wondering if anyone else has done something similar and if my desired solution is even possible.I’ve worn contacts for distance for 30 years and was considering RK surgery in my mid-20’s (and later Lasik) until I started using extended wear lenses. I just found these so good and trouble-free that I never saw the need to risk Lasik. This is a very different experience from wearing glasses for distance, where you constantly see the edge of the lens in your periphery and images are distorted depending on where you are looking. I’m generally on the computer for 6-10 hours per day and I have an array of monitors on my desktop between 24” and 32” from my eyes. Due to presbyopia, I use 1.25 readers for the computers and 2.00 readers or magnifying glass for close work and the constant on/off is what I find most irritating. If I can use contact for distance, eliminate the glasses for computers and only use readers for close work, I’d be very happy with my results.Is this a valid outcome to hope for? I know that dry eyes and other issues are somewhat common after this type of surgery. I don’t mind wearing glasses for a few months post surgey if needed and, although I’d highly like to go back to extended-wear lenses, I’d settle for daily wear disposable instead if I couldn’t tolerate extended wear anymore. However, if there is a substantial chance that I would not be able to wear contacts, I’d probably opt for a low-add multifocal or Symfony now instead of the monofocal.One additional reason is that my surgeon wants to do both eyes within 2 months because of the multifocal lens. The cataract in my left eye has no noticeable effect on my vision yet. It was noticed 2 years ago (the same time as my right eye) but still has no impact on my vision. I believe if I go with a monofocal IOL I would not need the surgery on my other eye until it interferes with my vision, but please give me advice on this. Thank you very much in advance for any advice or comments."

Cataract,Cataract Monofocal Lens - Six Month Follow Up,"I thought I would report back and let you all know I had cataract surgery six months back and had a Alcon mono focal toric lens placed in both eyes. After the first eye was set for distance, I was very concerned about losing all my near version. My doctor set my second eye for distance but set it /2 diopter in for slightly better near vision (mini - mono vision).I have no halos or any night vision issues at all. My vision is stable and no different than six weeks after each surgery. My vision (probably like most is slightly better or worse on any given day). Today it was 20/25 in both eyes (missed a few letters at 20/20) for distance and it was 20/25 for near. On some days it's 20/20 and other days more like today depending on how windy it is, humidity and other factors.Personally, I believe it's possible to improve your near vision by trying to use your near vision more. In other words, for me, I find that holding my phone at the right distance or any kind of reading at the right distance makes it a lot easier. Instead of 5 inches from my eyes prior to surgery, I now hold my phone 18"" to 20"" away and sometimes I might need to turn up the brightness slightly but I have a small phone (iphone 5s). I haven't bothered to adjust any font sizes in the settings I'm a creature of habit and it was difficult enough to retrain my brain to find that ""sweet spot"" 18-20"" away rather than 5"" after surgery. But, I almost never need or bother with reading glasses except for really small print or doing something up close.Overall, I'm very pleased. I can't stress how important I believe it is to find a really good doctor you trust. Best to all. "

Cataract,Advice on Computer/Reading Glasses post Cataract Surgery,"I had cataract surgery on my right eye a year ago, and my left eye was done 4 months ago. My distance vision is excellent by I am struggling to get glasses for computer use. I am still using prescription reading glasses post my first surgery and they are fine, and off-the-shelf glasses for computer use which are OK but not brilliant. My optician suggested enhanced reading glasses. As I have been a varifocal user for years, I thought that I wouldn't have any issues. The new glasses are fine for my left eye but poor (unfocussed) for my right eye.As my right eye subscription hasn't changed for reading over the past year, I am surprised that I can see print clearly using my 'old' glasses but not my new ones. My dispenser thinks that I am in the 2% category that will not adapt to regressive lenses. I struggle to understand how this can be? The dispenser is adamant that the spectacles are built to the prescription.Qn: Do I try with another brand of regressive lenses, or would I be better to use 2 sets of glasses: a pair for reading and a pair for computer use?As an aside, my new IOLs are great most of the time. I have though noticed more migraine-related spider webs that last up to 15 minutes; some light flashing and I do get refraction off the lens edge in very dark small pin point light situations (eg; small LED on clock in a dark bedroom).

Cataract,"Bionic Lens - should we wait for this ""transformative"" lens?","The Bionic Lens is an intra-ocular lens, a group of lenses which are surgically inserted into a patient’s eye, usually after cataract removal, to restore sight. Now patented world-wide, the Bionic Lens is designed to replace the eye’s natural lens, before cataract development, a refractive procedure currently known as refractive lens exchange (RLE). By imparting customized modifications to each lens, not just the prescription but ‘higher order aberrations’ can be corrected, allowing the full potential of a healthy visual system to be realized.Media interest has understandably focused on the superior distance vision this lens promises. However, the true transformation will lay in the ability to successfully allow dynamic changes in vision from “optical infinity to 1 inch away in less than ¼ sec”, as he purports. This is where, to date, any other procedure has fallen short of even approaching this claim. In May, Dr. Webb and his Harvard appointed, medical advisory team will present initial animal study results at a conference of cataract and refractive surgeons in New Orleans. What will certainly spark greater interest is, a demonstration of how the Bionic lens can be successfully folded and injected into the eye via a small, suture-less incision, an accomplishment which was 8 years in the making. To date, Dr Webb remains optimistic that in Canada and several other interested countries, approval for some level of use may occur in 2017Over the last 25 years my partners and I have observed the scientific path of this optometrist/researcher as well as the evolution and passage of numerous refractive procedures. It is with great interest that we await to see where these 2 vectors shall ultimately intersect…in the future of vision"
Cataract,Ghosting Double Image,"I had cataract surgery 4.5 weeks ago for my -8.5d left eye. A multifocal Oculentis Mplus X was implanted. Vision now is -2.75d with excellent near vision. I noticed when I look at any distant image that is either white or is reflective (metal pole) under sunny conditions, I see a mirror ghost-like image by it. For example looking at a white color private plane at a distance there's a double image or a white rooftop, a double image. The surrounding area is mono-image. Is this normal? Has anyone encountered this?"
Cataract,Sinus Infection after Cataract Surgery,"i wanted to share my story hoping it might help someone else. I had my second eye done and the next day my eye sight was amazing. By the third day I had absolutely no discomfort. I was so happy as I had had problems with my first eye. On the fourth day I showered and washed my hair being careful using my shield, tape and keeping my head back. Unfortunately some water seeped into my shield and my eye got wet. It stung terrible and I was terrified. I had read this could cause infection. All weekend my eye hurt badly. Saw the dr on ties but he didn't seem concerned but gave me drops to elevate pressure. Two days later I was back as my eye was extremely painful. He said the incision was iritated but again nothing wrong. I also mentioned I had a bad headache over my eye. He said see your dr you have a sinus infection. Went to urgent care the next day and was prescribed a strong antibiotic. The next day my pain was almost gone. The point of my long story is don't give up. If you think something is wrong there probably is. I wish you all great vision "

Cataract,Eyes changed color after cateract surgery ,Had cataract surgery on both eyes in August . Just noticed last week and half that I no longer have brown eyes they are a pretty hazel color now ???what happened ! I had the Restor lens ! I will see my doctor oct. 23 again . Hope he can tell me . 
Cataract,Biometry difference to contact lens prescription,"My glasses prescription is: R: -1.25D, -0.50D x 30°, L: -1.50D, -0.50D x 150° (+2D reading) and given the low myopia my contact lens prescription has the same sphere figures.I had biometry without any cataract as I am being offered the choice of having IOLs at the same time as vitrectomys (due to age and expected rapid onset of cataracts). Having pretty much ruled out multi-focals and extended depth of field IOLs I would like to get monofocals targeting near to intermediate. With my natural lenses I get a good compromise for that range, in effect around -1.5D/1.75D allowing for the astigmatism. However a little closer may be useful as I assume I could have some accommodation left.Eye biometry measurements should be more accurate than optometrists figures and there is rounding of some figures, but the eye biometry came up with:Right:AL:23.53 mm (SNR = 57.9)Kl: 44.23D D / 7.63 mm @7° K2: 44.94D D / 7.51 mm @97° R/SE: 7.57 mm / 44.58 DCyl.: -0.71D @ 7°ACD: 3.14 mmRefraction: -1.00 D -0.25 D @ 18°Left:AL:23.45 mm (SNR = 229.1)Kl: 44.18 D / 7.64mm @171°K2: 45.30 D I 7.45 mm @ 81°R/SE: 7.54 mm / 44.74 DCyl.: -1.12 @ 171°ACD: 3.12 mmRefraction: -1.25 D -0.50 D @ 140°I presume the Refraction lines are applicable but these are 0.25D less myopic than my contact lens prescriptions have been for years. So is this expected (such as glasses vs contacts) or are my contact lens prescriptions just slightly out?Although its a small difference I need to consider the lens options shown elsewhere on the report for IOL power against expected result such as Tecnis ZCB00 22.5D = -1.39D or 22.0D = -1.06D. Am I correct to assume these are relative to the ""Refraction"" figures above in which case I'll work on that rather than relative to what I thought my prescription was? If so then I'll reduce the target myopia that I discussed with the surgeon (I only got the report after the visit)I know I am stressing over this small but with the worry of the vitrectomy surgeries there's a lot to consider, so any clarification is appreciated as I don't want to leave this to the day of surgery."

Cataract,Cataract surgery in rt eye yesterday,"My husband who is 76 had cataract surgery in his right eye yesterday and he said his vision in the eye is better and his vision is not so good when he wears his old glasses. He needs to have the left eye done as well. I advise him not to drive until he sees the consultant in two weeks time. He thinks he can meet the DVL requirements of 20 mts but want to make sure. Two weeks without driving is a long time for him is there anybody else I could ask for advice? He has been wearing glasses since he was 18 yrs. He is like a little boy meeting father xmas for the first time he said his vision is very clear but the lt eye needs to be done, not sure when. I am sure the optician wants him to have the other eye done to get the right prescription. That can takes months, anybody got any advice what to do in the meantime. Thanks "

Cataract,Laser vs. traditional surgery,My Mom has extremely bad cataracts. The laser costs 1400- per eye(not covered by Medicare). The doctor said on a scale of 1-5(5 being the worst) my Mom's are almost a 5. We were leaning toward traditional but since they are so bad he really thinks the laser is the best way to remove them for a good result. I had taken her to a different doctor several months ago but he was just too pushy and seemed all about only making the extra money for the laser so I took her to someone else who I was told would not push the laser which he did not but strongly recommended it for a good result. I only care about doing the best thing for my Mom(she is 81). I would love some input and opinions on this topic. He also was going to do the second eye 12 days later. Is this ok?

I will be having RLE which is an elective surgery that I will be paying for privately.It seems that most people have a week to a few months wait between each eye operation. Having done some research, it seems that more and more doctors are now willing to do both eyes at the same time. There are some benefits to this but, of course, some potential concerns too.The plan for my eyes is to do one in the morning and the other in the evening on the same day. Wondering if anyone else has done both eyes on the same day and what their experience was like."

Cataract,Lasik AFTER having a trifocal lense implanted?,"Hi all...So I recently (2 months ago), had the Carl Zeiss Tri Toric lenses implanted in both eyes...I am only 33 years old but my vision before surgery was +8.50 and +8.75 with a -3.00 Astigmatism in both eyes, I had really good corrected vision, but my vision without glasses was utterly useless. Being young and active I really wanted to lose the thick glasses that I was heavily reliant on for pretty much everything, could not see near and far without them.2 months after surgery and I am overall very happy, however I do currently (as of yesterday) have a residual prescription of +1.00/-1.00 in the right eye, and +0.75/-0.75 in the left eye, with an ADD in the prescription of +2.00.My surgeon suggested the possibility of ""fine tuning"" with LASIK and I wondered if anybody here has had this done? If so, did it make a lot of difference to your initial results, and does anybody know if I am likely to achieve a much better quality of vision given my current prescription?One concern I have, is does getting your near vision corrected mean that you have to sacrifice some distance vision, or is the whole spectrum likely to be of better quality if the figures are closer to ZERO?I know it has to be at least 3 months after surgery but thats fine because I work abroad and with my current schedule, couldn't possibly have it done until December anyway at the soonest. I also worry about coming across ""ungrateful"", considering 3 months ago I couldn't see a thing without very strong glasses, and now I haven't worn a pair of glasses for anything in 2 months, though I am sure there is no way I could do any up close work that required detailed vision, like threading a needle for example. However I paid a hell of a lot of money for this surgery, and want the absolute best possible results, so if LASIK can achieve this, I can't see a good reason not to take advantage of that considering it's part of the package that I bought.Your input would be most appreciated!

Cataract,please help with my cataract lens replacement decision,"Hi, I've seen two doctors in regards to a cataract in my left eye. My original question was this one:https://patient.info/forums/discuss/second-guessing-my-cataract-replacement-lens-609989?page=0&utm_source=forum&utm_campaign=comment-notification&utm_medium=email#2827761I emailed my doctor and he responded with the message below. I am not sure what he means, but I think he says my replacement lens should be -.75? Could anyone please help me decipher this? Thanks!-3 dpt will make you very near sighted. When you get cataract surgery in the other eye you will not be able to choose ""distance"" without risking double images between your -3 dpt and your fully corrected eye. It is safer to choose a moderate distance of -0.75 dpt unless you have practice with a big difference between the two eyes. "
Cataract,Laser touch up after cataract op ,"I am trying to find out the degree of risk of having a small laser adjustment to correct the prescription of +0.75 sphere, -0.5 cylinder after my cataract operation, using a monofocal iol ? I have heard of a risk that a laser adjustment can cause an area of cloudy or misty vision, but am not sure statistically how likely this would be to occur ? I was very myopic -15, and had a retinal tear repair about 16 years ago, so both these factors may increase the risk. (I won't be seeing the surgeon again until November to ask him this question)!"
Cataract,2 PROBLEMS AFTER 10 YEARS,"Some mornings I awake to very blurry vision that takes hours to rectify if I sleep with something pressed against my eye.The other issue is that when I go into the bright sun (or any other bright light) , it can take up to 7 minutes until I can see clearly again. Does anyone have the same issues, and why is this happening?"
Cataract,Mini monovision after cataract op,"My left (non dominant) eye has had a monofocal iol lens implanted for full distance. In fact it is slightly over corrected: +0.5 sphere (strength) and -0.5 cylinder (astigmatism). Would it work to have a slightly weaker iol lens in my right eye, to achieve mini-monovision, when the op is done next year, given that the right eye is dominant ?I suppose I could have a subsequent laser adjustment, but think there may be risks involved, especially as I am highly myopic.

Cataract,When can you return to your normal exercise routine?,"Yesterday my ophthamologist gave me the green light to return to my favorite exercise, cycling. It's been 4 weeks +2 days since my cataract surgery on my left eye. The 1st week after my surgery, I stayed home. The second week onwards I started light walking. After the green light, I went out today and cycled 34.71 km (21.56 miles) on relatively flat terrain using my enduro road bike. I basically maintained a 19kph+- pace. A few times I increased the pace and at one short hill I semi powered up it. I could feel the eye hasn't quite healed yet. My question is how long does it take to ""fully recover"" before one can cycle (or exercise) to your 100% norm?I'm a 65 years old retired man that normally rides a mountain hardtail bike averaging 500-750 miles a month. I ride mostly in the mountains on tarmac. I ride 6 times a week or sometimes everyday for weeks. For me, that's my normal.

Cataract,Second guessing my cataract replacement lens,"Hi, I've spoken to 2 different doctors regarding my cateracts. I'm a younger cataract patient in my 40s. My left is has a big cataract that really interferes with my vision. My right eye has a very early-stage cataract which doesn't affect me yet.I don't know what these numbers mean really, but my left eye is -3, and my right is -1.I have worn glasses since I was young. Now, due to age, I must take my glasses off to read a book or look at my phone; which doesn't really bother me.The first doctor says I should get one eye adjusted for far and the other near(I think he said -.75 and 0).The 2nd doctor says I should just get the bad eye done now, and keep it at -3. This would mean I would still need glasses, but I could take them off when reading. So I guess nothing would change except I wouldn't have the bad cataract anymore.But now, I'm wondering if I should do the bad eye now and get a lens for distance, but still do the right eye later. Would that be too much of a difference for my brain to handle?My only thing is, I DO NOT want to need reading glasses. That is my only concern.Thanks!"
Cataract,Informing my decision re: 1st cataract surgery (70.5 y/o male),"First, thank God I found this forum! The seemingly millions of posts have been helpful to me...so THANK YOU ALL.I am only needing to have IOL placement in one (right) eye. (I am not sure how you know or find out WHICH eye is your DOMINANT eye?)I don't drive or play golf or even enjoy sunsets, so distance vision is what I will correct with glasses. I believe it is therefore logical for me to get a NEAR-focused monofocal IOL for this surgery. The first opthalmologist I went to said, ""No, you can't. You can only correct far distance vision and then used glasses for near vision."" So, I am pretty sure I won't be asking her to do the surgery. The left eye, I am told, is not ""ready"" for surgery that is not necessary.Four questions for the forum readers/experts!1) Am I correct in assuming that correcting near vision with monofocal IOL will work? Then I will eventually get glasses (which I have always worn and don't mind always wearing till the end) for distance vision and for the near vision if the IOL monofocal doesn't correct that perfectly.2) I can now see with both eyes (even without glasses on) better at distances than I can close up. So, I intuit that this means that I am FARSIGHTED, not myopic (does that last term = nearsighted?). But the terms' meanings are not clear in my mind. I understand from reading the posts that I will ""lose"" this far vision if I correct with near-focused monovision IOL. BUT, am I correct in assuming that post-surgery the eyeglass prescription lenses will restore my ability to see at far distances to as well as the glasses do currently?3) From some of the posts about computer and phone use, it appears that with IOL correction of NEAR vision, you really cannot see CLOSE UP (say, 10-20 cms or 1 foot, more or less). If that is true, doesn't it mean that I will therefore have to have progressive prescription eyeglasses even after the surgery in order to see very close up, like medicine bottles- labels?4) I did not see this question in the forum: Why couldn't I just get the cataracts removed and have a clear IOC implanted, in which case, of course, I would just continue to use progressive (or bifocal) eyeglasses for near and far vision purposes (as now), without the cataracts that make all vision less clear?Thanks for sharing your insights and experiences relative to this questions!Stan - Mexico City"
Cataract,Eye make up remover after cataract surgery?,What is safe to use to remove mascara and eye lid pencil after cateract surgery ? My surgery 2 weeks ago?
Cataract,Symfony toric lens cataract surgery September 2017,"First off, I would like to thank profusely everyone who has commented about their cataract surgery experience, especially softwaredev. I've learned a great deal, but I'm still anxious about my two Symfony toric cataract surgeries scheduled for 6 (right) & 13 (left/dominant) September 2017.I'm 67 and have an active lifestyle: skiing, cycling, hiking, and climbing. I have stigmatisms, am quite myopic, and have worn glasses for more than 60 years. Glasses corrected my vision to 20/20, near & far, until last year. I gave up on hard and soft contact lenses about 20 years ago.The plan is micro-monovision with a goal for 20/20 both eyes throughout the range of vision (as I understand it.) During the consultation, the surgeon said that he would probably use the ZXT 150 lens, but that he was going to analyze my measurements a bit more before making a decision.I had asked about ""reverse"" micro-monovision because I use my right-eye exclusively for an optical scope sometimes, but the surgeon said that ""reverse"" was problematic and not as predictable as the normal micro-monovision.I would be grateful to hear from anyone who has experienced or knows about ""reverse"" micro-monovision.The surgeon said that I would have better depth perception with this approach than if a monofocal toric lens were placed in my left eye and the Symfony toric lens in my right eye.Halos, starbursts, and glare are not too important to me as I rarely drive on busy public roads at night.The surgeon's informational packet has a couple of booklets extolling the wonders of laser cataract surgery, but he told me that there would be no difference in the outcome between laser and blade surgery. The professional literature seems to be mixed on this question, but my feeling is to go with blade because that's what the surgeon first suggested; he was #1 in his undergraduate class at Harvard (physics, concentration in optics), graduated from Duke Medical School with highest honors, and has had an extremely successful practice for 20 years.The surgeon said that he would do the surgeries with laser if I wanted, so I would be interested to know if anyone on ""Patient"" has had cataract surgery and would recommend it over blade for specific reasons.The surgeon will not do a LRI with me and he does not believe that I shall require a lasik enhancement post-op for excellent vision.The surgeon's literature states:""The ORA laser scan is used as need. The ORA takes intraoperative wavefront aberrometry readings.""The Symfony literature states:""1. Automated examinations may not give reliable results. These may include: auto refractors using infra-red light, wavefront sensors, photo reactors, and the Duochrome test. Manifest refraction with maximum plus technique is recommended.""Is the ORA problematic in view of Abbot's advice about measurement?About 7% of Symfony patients (per Abbot) have some problem related to the surgery; I shall try to mitigate any complication by taking the anti-inflammatory drops exactly as directed and generally using common sense: no heavy lifting, hard exercise, eye-rubbing, fast movement for a fortnight. The surgeon will administer an anti-biotic shot during the surgeries.My German Shepherd, Vait, goes everywhere with me; although he won't be in the operating theatre, the surgeon said that it would be fine if he accompanied me on this trip. (I had been a bit worried about infection.)I would be grateful for any other tips anyone might have for good recovery.The day after surgery apparently I should be able to drive; that will entail Denver freeways and then about 150 miles of mountain driving. Again, it would be helpful to hear from people who have had challenging driving directly after cataract surgery.I live on a ranch and for about five weeks after the surgeries I plan to deal with paperwork rather than the dirty, dusty work of the ranch in the hope that my eyes will be completely healed when I do return to what makes the ranch actually run.The cataract in my right eye is getting really bad. Hence I am inclined to get this done now.My left eye has a small cataract, but that eye is still correctable to 20/20 with glasses. The surgeon's advice is to do the left eye as well now, albeit new cataract lenses are in development. Given his high success rate I'll take his advice. Each iteration may well be better, but the Symfony usually has excellent results and its doubtful that any toric lens will ever be perfect. Sometimes it's better not to let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Has Symfony (Abbot) published any data on studies of cataract patients with astigmatism >1 d?In sum, I would really appreciate any advice for the procedure and recovery which anyone may have.Thanks very much for your consideration!"
Cataract,Which cataract operation is best? (Private/laser or NHS and why?),"I am 58 years old and have cataracts in both eyes and the NHS say they will do them now (for ages they've been saying the cataracts weren't ripe enough). I have found out that Laser surgery privately is approx £2500-£3000 per eye. This is a lot of money to spend if the NHS is just as good, but it is well worth spending if it means I will have superior eyesight afterwards (especially as I hope to live a long lifeCan anyone advise if it is worth going privately E.g. Are the risks of poor vision afterwards greater or less? Will laser treatment give me better vision than the NHS treatment? Do I need to ask for specific lenses? I'd really appreciate some advice.

Cataract,Cataracts/Vision Loss,"Do cataracts grow independently of one another in each eye? If one eye is good and if the other is bad, will using the good eye over time get worse since there's more strain on it? Also how do you distinguish between other eye conditions such as vision loss from glaucoma and temporal arteritis without an evaluation? It seems hard to tell if your vision is getting worse from cataracts alone or something else when you have cataracts."
Cataract,"Cataract surgery, acute anxiety and tremor.","I am an eighty year old lady and have had Essential Tremor (hands) for the last thirty years. I also suffer from anxiety which at times makes the tremor much worse, extending to head and even legs. I need cataract surgery which means I will have to lay absolutely still for about thirty minutes. I have read and made myself familiar with all the procedure and of course it sounds 'no problem'. I went through the pre-op checks and explained about my anxiety and tremor and whether I could manage to be 'shake free during the procedure. The consultant wasn't really interested and said, ""You'll probably be OK. as your head doesn't shake all the time."" Came the day of the operation and I had tried to calm myself and was determined to 'see it through. On pre op checks at the hospital my pulse read as 215. Another nurse, very wisely thought that the tremor may have something to do with the high reading so she tested pulse manually. It was still high at 108. but obviously the tremor had affected the reading. At that stage I began to panic a bit and felt like walking out but I didn't.I also had a slight chest infection so the surgeon said, ""We cannot carry out this procedure today. Go back and see your doctor.""My question is, Why for very anxious patients and those like me with additional problems, (tremor and asthma) is there not a simple injected sedative, to relax the patient and make this 'so called simple' procedure completely stress free.? I just wish the whole thing would 'go away'Thank you for reading. Just wanted to have a moan."

Cataract,Symfony IOL expectations ,"Hello I posted earlier on these forums regarding my prep for cataract surgery sometime later this year. I would just like to hear how people implanted with the Symfony IOL lens are holding up after their eyes have have healed abit and settled down. Im still having a very hard time deciding if Symfony IOL is worth the risk of having the possibility of glare and halos at night for the extended depth of focus. How is the range of vision and is it really sharp and contrast compared to a monofocal? I'm also concerned about the widely discussed issue about having circles around lights during nighttime. I hear people say they see them on tailights of cars and some also say streetlights as well. I can only imagine what if you were to stumble upon a traffic jam freeway full of lights and cars or in a crowded city at night that those concentric circles multiplied by several dozens would be quite overwhelming. For people with Symfony, are you all seeing these visual webbed circles with the majority of lights at night? At concerts or sporting stadiums (with bright overhead projections ad what not) And how are you guys with watching at the movie theater since those situations are in a dark surroundings with sometimes very bright cinematography. I saw some posts saying people see a white glow around lettering in black/dark backgrounds on tvs or monitors. And another saying there's a halo around the moon! I would think that monofocal IOL lens would be more sharper contrast of detail when it comes to viewing lighting at nights. Eventually I really want to become a 3D concept artist, but if the Symfony might give me extra ordinary artifacts when working on a project on the computer that's gonna be a problem for me. I know a lot of people say their excellent for computer intermediate distance but what about seeing that clarity and contrast of light/dark figures on a screen. Will there be a suspectibiliy to glares and halos in that line of work?I have a lot of factors to consider still and would highly appreciate some personal experience for everybody here that has had the Symfony IOL for cataract surgery. Since I am planning to work a lot with computers for my career i do like the convenience that the Symfony has and that it's good for intermediate range and some for distance but want to also know how does that range of vision holdup compared to a monofocal IOL. I understand the range of monofocal is not as varied and set at one point compared as the Symfony but which one is sharper at the desired distance? am worried that even a monofocal set for distance might be sharper or clearer than the Symfony IOL. And than using glasses on top of monofocal for other nearer close up and intermediate would be clearer as well? I know Symfony sounds good on paper but everything I hear on the personal annocdotes seem to be a lot of negative issues and people resorts to having them taken out. I will have to think about this as I know their is no such thing as a perfect lens available. And it is what it is but still need to make a wise and well minded decision. "

Cataract,What decides how good/poor near vision is after cataract surgery? (Distance IOLs),"So reading glasses are from +1 to +3 in the stores. What glasses does one get for reading after distance IOLs implant? And can this vision get worse as you age just like if hadn't got the cataract surger?"
Cataract,"Your Post Lasik Cataract Surgery Results (Trifocals, EDOFs, Multifolcals and Halos—oh my!)","I posted this on the 7th of August but it has been in moderation and it is now the 10th so I am posting it again. If it gets posted twice, I will attempt to remove the duplicate...My name is Jorge. I am in the US. I had Lasik in 2004 and vision was great until about 3-4 years ago. I initially saw an opthalmologist who told me that I had a cataract forming in my left eye and another just starting in my right.I was also told that they were not ""ripe"" and that I should wait about a year before looking into surgery. It has been about 3 yrs now and the vision in my left eye is really annoying me. I have been trying to drink water and carrot juice and all sorts of other things but the vision continues to worsen. I have done a lot of research on IOLs and it seems clear that in the US our IOL options are very limited compared to what is available in Mexico, Germany, Turkey, Greece and Belgium (probably many other places too).I was seriously considering traveling to another country to have the surgery done because of the options (trifocals such as the Reviol Tri-ED or the LIght Adjustable Lens. The LAL was developed here in the California yet is still not yet approved by the FDA but I believe it has been available elsewhere since 2009. I hear they are ""close"" to approving it here).I am now thinking that I should maybe NOT go elsewhere because if there are any complications or adjustments that need to be done, they would not have any experience with those lenses here and because I had chosen to go around them, may be all too pleased to tell me that I would have to fly back there for them to deal with me.I would like to ask people who have had Trifocals, multifocals and EDOFs what results they have had. I have been told that none are perfect and that I will have to compromise on one of the following:• near vision• intermediate vision• long distance vision• night or driving vision (halos and glare)• low light vision (the ability to see properly in low light situations)I was told that almost all lenses other than monofocals will produce halos/glare but that after about 3-6 months my brain would adjust and I would not notice them.I have been dealing with the cataract getting worse and worse for 3 years now, I am wondering if the halows I would see after the surgery could possibly be any worse than how I am seeing now. Maybe it would be a marked improvement!One doctor told me that that I should try the ""small aperture"" IOL because by using a small aperture it extends the depth of field. That made sense so I then followed up with a question about low light sensitivity (since just like a camera, you can get almost infinite DOF if you stop the lens down but you then you can almost not see anything unless it is bright daylight), he never responded.There was another lens, the Reviol Tri-ED. I contacted the author of an article: ""The Lens: Reviol Tri-ED” (/). The article made the lens sound great because it had great light distribution. He sent me a research article: RESEARCH ARTICLE Open AccessClinical outcomes of a new diffractivetrifocal intraocular lens with EnhancedDepth of Focus (EDOF)Banu Torun Acar1*, Erkan Duman2 and Saban Simsek1Everything sounds great until I ask him:Besides the Reviol, are there any other IOLs that you recommend to eliminate halos as well as providing continuous focus from close to far?His response: In Reviol and Zeiss, there are complaints about halo glare. Alcon Panoptics gives us better results.Keep in mind that this was the doctor who penned the research article that stated: ""All our patients achieved spectacle independence without an incidence of photic phenomena, such as halos and glare at 6 month-follow up.""I cannot ask any of the local doctors what their opinion is on these other lenses because they will only recommend what THEY can do and claim that the FDA only approves the latest and greatest and if they have not approved it, then they are ""obviously not having good results overseas"".So at this point, I am completely confused.1) I can get the surgery done here in the US knowing that there are more advanced and probably better lenses with possibly fewer post surgery abberations and side effects.2) Go to another country where I will have to stay 1-3 weeks and then hope that when I come home nothing needs anymore work3) I can go to Mexico and get the LAL but I do not really know how competent they are there. The LAL is adjusted post-op and after your eye has healed (about 2 weeks). Up until your eyes heal, you must wear a pair of UV blocking sunglasses for those 2 weeks so as not to inadvertently expose and thus alter the lenses. After 2 weeks you go back, to the office, they measure your eyes as they are now healed and then adjust the lenses and then once it is dialed in, lock the lens in with another Laser that then prevents any further changes to the lens. The thing about the LAL is that they change shape and can get bigger than when first implanted and if they need to be removed (I don't know under what circumstances you would need them removed) it can be a chalenge since they will be bigger than when they went in.4) Go to Canada and see what options they have there5) Go to Greece to visit a doctor who practices both in NY and Greece. If I had to make any changes I would only have to go to New York but that might also be a PITA if I had to do it more than once.6) Go to New Zealand. There is a doctor there who is one of the few in the world who has worked with the Harmoni lens and I do plan on moving to NZ within 2-3 yrs but that is a much bigger hassle if I have to go there because of the long flight times and their expense.So, in closing, I would like to hear from people who have had Lasik. I would like to know what type of lens you opted opted for (multifocals or mono) and why. I would like to know if you are happy with them and if you would recommend them.Thanks in advance and sorry for the long post but I wanted to give as much background as possible.Sincerely,Jorge "

Cataract,Monocular Double Vision after cataract surgery,"Anyone on here experienced double vision with just one eye after a cataract is removed ? Does it go away ? Is it a serious problem ?I had one cararact, in my right eye removed in 2014. I've just (8 days ago) had the other one, in the left, weaker, eye, removed.Vision is a little blurred but is significantly improved over what it wasI should explain this eye was highly myopic pre-surgery (-10 !!!) and the surgeon said they were aiming for an end result that would leave me slightly short sighted, because of the power of th elens they needed to insert !On balance I reckoned that this was OK as after all i've been needing what looks like the end of a beer bottle for my spectacles up to now !Everything seems OK, no pain, and yes i can see.However, when i CLOSE my right eye and look at something such as the ""fire exit"" or ""fire door keep closed"" signs in the office using just my left, there is clearly a degree of double vision, a ghost image if you like, slightly up from and to the right of the real one, which makes the writing blurred....So my questionsWill this go away, or am i in trouble here.I have asked the clinic that did the op, they said ""nothing to worry about"". However, I recognised the voice of the woman who told me that. Back in 2014, when I had the other eye done, i rang after a week and a half because I'd noticed ""something funny when i blinked"". The same woman told me this was ""nothing to worry about then"". On that occasion, the retina had detached and I was left blissfully unawate of the danger I was in for three weeks ..."
Cataract,Laser adjustment after cataract surgery,"The surgeon who did my cataract operation has agreed to a laser adjustment, for the astigmatism (cylinder = -0.5 or -0.75) and for the slight over correction (Sphere = +0.5 or +0.75).But I am not sure what target strength to request, particularly as both the cylinder and sphere will be adjusted). I would be happy to be slightly undercorrected (as I was previously very short-sighted, and the mid distance vision would be easier) providing the distance vision is sufficient for say daytime driving (I wouldn't mind wearing glasses to drive at night). My prescription before the catarct op was -15 sphere. The other eye is scheduled to be done next year, following an unsuccessful contact lens trial (strength -11 go -14 diopters) - that unfortunately produced fluctuating double vision and prescription strength.

Cataract,Cataract surgery isn't exactly a walk in the park. ,"I'm shocked by how many people have had rather devastating outcomes. Prior to my cataract surgery, I believed this procedure was all but risk free. Ever since LASIK came on the market and people were suddenly able to see without glasses/contact lenses after a procedure that took literally minutes, somethjng changed. Maybe we became a bit complacent, I don't know.The fact remains that regardless of the method, surgery is surgery and there will always be very real risks. Nobody will ever care as much about your eyes, as you. "
Cataract,How couple of tweaks works after having mono focal lens implanted,"I am waiting for the cataract eye surgery for the right eye. left eye was done one and a half years ago, and that time I had full blown cataract on both eyes. I freaked out to do both eyes at one time.After the lazer cataract surgery on the left eye the clear distance mono focal was implanted. I see distance and middle ground and using glass for reading.I chooses mono focal because I heard some where cuple of tweaks on top of the mono focal can give the freedom to stay glass free.I am 66 and no other eye issues. I waited more than one year to confirm the result of the surgery. I have slight crescent shadow right after surgery, now it doesn't bother me that much. And I have dry eyes and slightly discoloured look on my left eye around the cornea after surgery.I am a visual artist need to see actual size. Does mini mono vision will show the actual structure or it shows the object slightly deformed?Will with clear distance mono focal with cuple of tweaks help me for 3 level of distance?How these tweaks were done? Is it invasive? I am afraid with my dry eyes it may bring other complications. The modal I have in my left eye is ZCB00Diopter + 23 0DT: 13 mmB: 6 mmThank you very much "
Cataract,Misty eye after waking,"Since the cataract operation in my left eye last October, it has been misty for about half an our after waking up in the morning, with halos around lights.

The contact lens practitioner said my other eye is also somewhat dry, but it suffers less from morning mistiness. "

As I have had a monofocal lens inserted, could the prescription be reduced a little using laser or prk ?At the moment, everything about 12ft away or nearer is progressively out of focus, which I find disconcerting after previously being very myopic.I would like to improve my mid-distance vision a little, and wouldn't mind if full distance was less good. I am quite happy to wear specs for driving - the only activity I do where I need full distance.I was offered mid-distance, but the surgeon didn't explain exactly which distance this referred to and didn't recommend it as I would need to wear specs for everything - which I now need to do except for driving.

Cataract,Growth,"How fast can these suckers grow? In Nov my cataract really seemed to effect my vision and April my Optomitrist and Opthamologist said the reason for my messed up vision is because of my cataract. It feels worse but I'm not sure if it's because I'm becoming more hyper aware or if it's growing quickly. I know my questions are dumb, but I'm young and out of luck on corrective surgery and I'm dealing with this new reality"
Cataract,St johns wort ,Was thinking of taking St John's Wort to help with mild depressions but have read that it can be harmful to lens cells in your eyes. Having had refractive lens exchange would this even be an issue as my natural lens has been removed? Any advice would be most welcome.

Cataract,Technis Symfony Multifocal Lens,I am scheduled for my first cataract surgery next week. I have cataracts in both eyes.

Cataract,Monovision or ? For farsighted,"We are talking about monovision - might test it with a contact lense. I am farsighted +2.75 and +4 and 2 for my progressive eyeglasses. I haven't had my measurements yet. I think I have astigmatism. Worn glasses since 13 and Williamstown Ng to wear readers, but I would love to be glasses free for dinner plates and walking around. Lots of discussions about nearsighted but what about me?"

Cataract,Monofocal iol set for near vision,"Hello all, I would like to ask something to people who had theirs monofocal iol set for near vision. Actually two questions:1) wearing glasses for far vision, can you see well even close? I mean, can you read a text wearing far-glasses or you must put them off in order to read a book?2) how far can you see decently (without too much blurry)?"
Cataract,Monovision with monofocal lens implants?,"i would like the hear from people who have had two different lenses, mid and long distance. This is the surgery I am having for cataract and glaucoma in my right eye August 1 and the second surgery in my left eye on August 15. I am very worried about the two different distant lenses. My left eye has only a minor problem at this time. They will be putting in a mid-range lense in my right eyes. Should I have surgery on the left eyes too, they suggest a longer range lense for my left eye. So worried how this will all work."
Cataract,Need cataract surgery..CONFUSED,"MY mother is 81 and has bad cataracts. I live on Long Island in NY. She had been told for years she needed surgery but put it off because she could still see well enough until now. I took her to a local Doctor who was recommended. I figured he would just examine her and we would set up the surgery. Well I was unaware of all the choices she would have to make. The Doctor was only pushing laser cataract surgery which costs 1600- per eye.I was made to feel laser is the only way to go. Is traditional cataract surgery not good anymore? Then the office wanted me to come in for a pre cataract appointment to discuss the options. I was told the measurements taken at this appointment would cost 300- per eye but if I chose to do the laser they would waive that fee. I never heard of all these charges before. What is the cost out of pocket for traditional cataract surgery? Am I supposed to pay for measurements prior to surgery? Is there anyone who lives in Nassau County, LI that can recommend a Doctor? As I said I am so confused. I just want the best care for my Mother. "

Cataract,Reviews on Symfony Toric lens for cataract surgery,"Hello all, I am scheduled for a cataract surgery in both my right and left eye and am very young (17 years old).

Cataract,Unexplained IOL Procedure & Post Cataract Astigmatism,"I am a 63 yr old female.Had cataract surgery on both eyes one week apart in March. Doc discussed various visual outcomes and I told him my current vision was acceptable with reading and computer vision and only wore glasses for driving with minor correction. I said I wanted the IOL's that insurance would pay for. He asked me then if I wanted monovision, but did not explain to me what this was. Not knowing the difference between monovision and monofocal, I agreed to the procedure. You can imagine my surprise post surgery when one eye was set for near and the other eye for distance! Had he explained what monovision was, I would have never agreed to this, having tried several types of contacts several years ago for near and far vision. My optomitrist told me I wasn't a good candidate for these type of lenses. In addition to the monovision IOL's, my vision now is quite unacceptable. Pre-surgery vision was RT: Sphere -0.75, Cylinder -0.50, Axis 020, Add +2.50. LT: Sphere -1.25, Cylinder -0.25, Axis 060, Add +2.25. Post-surgery vision is now RT: Sphere -0.50, Cylinder -1.75, Axis 005, Add +2.25. LT: Sphere -1.25, Cylinder -1.75, Axis 015, Add +2.25. You can imagine my concern when my astigmatism (Axis) increased -1.25 in right eye and -1.50 in left eye. My dr said that my cataracts were ptobably masking this astigmatism?? I now have uncorrected astigmatism and double vision in both eyes. His options to correct this are either PRK or trifocal glasses I would need to wear all the time! Both options I would have to pay for. My questions are: 1) Can cataracts 'MASK' astigmatism pre-surgery or is this bull? I have read a lot about surgically induced astigmatism, but dr seemed put off by this suggestion. I know any kind of cut in the eye can increase astigmatism, but this much? 2) Do I have any recourse due to his lack of explanation of the monovision procedure? If he had explained this procedure to me, I would have shared my prior experience and told him this was NOT acceptable.Anyone else with a similar experience? I plan to get a second opinion from another opthalmologist this next week."
Cataract,Feeling nervous about my Cataract operation,"Hi everyone,I was referred for cataract removal and am feeling very nervous about it. I saw the Consultant on 21st June and he confirmed that my right eye needed to be done first, I was a bit shocked at this, as I didn't even know I had one in the left eye! He said that the one in the right eye was a Dense Brunescent white cataract and when I asked if that made things easier or more difficult, he said more care was needed to remove it. I'm just hoping for some reassurance really. x"

Cataract,2nd eye now done,"As those of you who've seen some of my other posts I got cataract surgery in my right eye done on 10th May and now my left eye was done yesterday (5th July)As most posts on forums are about people with problems I thought I'd post my experiences of a (hopefully) trouble free successful surgery, since I was told by my surgeon that 98% of surgeries were successful I assumed I'd be one of them, unfortunately it didn't turn out quite that way ?I am surprised at the differences between the two surgeries, as I thought both eyes would be the same.Right eye: Main points wereVery quick surgeryVery little pain afterwards and practically no pain the next dayDistance vision was excellent, practically from day 1 (although that was to change)Initial starburst went after about 4 daysLeft eye:Surgery took much longer than the first eyeHad a lot of pain immediately after, although that may be due to getting a steroid injection into my eye (because of the problems in my other eye)No pain todayI'm a bit disappointed with the mini monovision, my distance and near are poor and my intermediate good, I thought both intermediate and near would be good - still it's early daysI'm still optimistic about a good overall outcome, if my Macular inflammation clears up and my near vision gets better I'll be delighted.For those contemplating cataract removal I can tell you the actual surgery is a breeze, my main advice would be to wait after the first eye gets done before you get the second one fixed as there can be vision changes even after a period of time - my first eye was brilliant for the first three weeks before I got inflammation of the Macular which has subsequently reduced my distance vision and given me distorted near vision ( I think, touch wood, that my near vision has stabilised in that eye and may be slightly better)Hope everyone having surgery soon has positive outcomes "

Cataract,"Vision improved after cataract surgery, then worsened 1 month later","I am writing about my mother who is in her 80's. she has glaucoma and wet and dry macular degeneration. She also had cataracts. One was removed and she was very pleased with the result. She could see better than ever. After a month or so, her vision declined. She said is seemed almost worse than befrore the surgery. She had some dryness before from the glaucoma drops. But, seemed to have more dryness. Drops don't seem to help much,i if at all. Her retina specialist attributes the decline in vision to a negative development with her retina (can' remember exactly the terminology). I find it strange that it was so good and then took a turn for the worse. She has not been back to the surgeon. Wonder if she should go. It ihas been about a year and she is depreseed.

Cataract,Retinal issues after cataract surgery,"I've not thought to ask if anyone has had retinal problems after cataract surgery. My surgeon sent me to retinal specialist after he noticed fluid seeping over to front of eye. Apparently, there's a possibility of a tear, etc. A ""strand of fluid"" is hanging in front of my eye. This is their explanation for foggy vision and floaters. Other than being left with the worst vision of my life, the most annoying after affect of this stinkin disastrous surgery, is a condition I can best describe as a cloudy curtain that rises and falls with blinks. To recap: Vision: Pre cataract surgeryCorrected with glasses. Took glasses off for close up vision. August 2016: Noticed a little blurriness. Diagnosed as small cataracts. Didn't need surgery, doc said. But, might as well not wait until it gets bad. Vision: Post cataractBlack floaters BlurrinessCloudy curtains HalosStarbursts Depth perception nightmare Driving at night is a dangerous thing Worn glasses since I was 4 and have never had worse vision. So many of these issues, as I've been told, are things that just happen. It's a coincidence that they appeared after surgery. ***North Suburban Eye Specialists Blaine/Coon Rapids MinnesotaHad anyone had surgery performed by surgeons in the group?"

Cataract,Recently diagnosed with bi lateral cataracts,"I was recently (yesterday) diagnosed with bi lateral cataracts. The onset of the deterioration of my vision has been incredibly fast - 4 weeks from being able to see ""normally"" (I am long sighted and only wear my glasses occasionally) to really struggling. I had my appointment with my optician yesterday and have been referred to my GP who I am seeing on Friday the 13th of September who will then refer me to the eye specialist at my local hospital. I am 39 and to be quite honest, very frightened. I was just wondering if anyone could help me with what to expect from here on in. I have glasses on order but they are going to be a couple of weeks before they come. My old glasses are useless and I am struggling to see the TV. Fortunately I can increase the font size on my Kindle and laptop so that isn't so much of a problem. I am not driving at the moment as I have uncontrolled epilepsy so that isn't a huge problem but I am knocking things over left right and centre. Has anyone any ideas how to help myself? I know things are going to get worse before they get better so I am hoping to get some ideas to help myself until I can get them removed. Thanks for listening and fingers crossed for some ideas to work with! "
Cataract,Pain after cataract surgery,I just had my cataract surgery on my right eye 12 hours ago. I have a lot of pain in the eye when i blink - feels like there is a pice of glass in in.

Cataract,Interested in your feedback on questions for opthamologist ,"I have an appointment Wednesday. Cataract surgery scheduled early July. Live in Canada so surgery and monofocal lens covered by our healthcare system. Am ok with additional expense for Symfony lens (which I am considering)What key issues/questions should I cover with opthamologist aside from possible halo/glare should I opt with Symfony. If I don't go with premium lens thinking I would prefer monofocals set for near vision given my line of work with computers. I currently wear glasses for distance - just starting needing a bit of help for intermediate distance. Optomestrist 2 years ago thought I should get used to wearing progressives although I take my glasses off for reading. Thinking it would be easier for me to adapt to what I have now and wear glasses for distance. Would appreciate for those who've already had cataract surgery to weigh in with your thoughts .Thanks - I am grateful for your feedback. Reading these forums has really helped me come to grips with realistic expectations and outcomes. Knowing there isn't an ideal lens out there - trying to decide what I would value more. "

Cataract,Glasses after cataract surgery,"Hello. Wondering if anyone can help.Had cataract surgery seven weeks ago in my right eye which is my dominate eye my left eye is a lazy eye. I did ask for a mono distance lens but not sure whats happened because I can read small print but need glasses for driving. I do not know what lens was put in. Had eyes tested last week for glasses and went yesterday to pick them up. I couldn't wait to be able to drive again.When I put them on I started to feel light headed straight way, the distance was fine. Was told that I would have to get use to them, so I walked out of the shop with them on. Walked around feeling really light headed. Took them off for a while and it took several minutes before I felt OK. Tried again and still felt light headed. Husband drove me home and yes my distance vision is loads better with the glasses on, could read all the road signs, but felt so lighheaded.When I got home and looked at my dining room table I realised that it sloped down on the left hand side. Phoned the opticians and was told by the girl who answered the phone to take them back. I had enquired about a distance contact lens and had a chat this morning with the gentleman that does this. Ive told him about my problem and he's told me that it may take me two weeks before I get use to them, that this is a common problem. My vision has changed alot and I am now short sighted in my right eye and long sighted in my left eye and my brain is trying to work out what its seeing, but my thoughts are:If this is right then surely I would of felt lighthead straight after the surgery?If it is right what he said I can't understand why surfaces are sloping to the left, if I shut my left eye when I've got the glasses on everything is straight. I think that the glasses aren't balanced properly and I am wasting my time trying to get use to them. When I had varifocal glasses in the past I had no problems at al, I know a lot of people have to get use to wearing them. Also in the past I manged fine with one multifocal contact lens in my right eye without having to have anything in the left lazy eye.. My husbands been wearing glasses a long time and in is opinion if they don't feel right straight away then they will never be right.Any advice would be appreciated.Little pea"
Cataract,Recommendations for IOL with least visual disturbances ,"Finding lens selection to be the hardest decision to make. I know there are none offering 100% guarantees. Thought I had settled on Symfony lenses however not feeling at peace with that decision. Wondering if I should go with an aspheric IOL (monofocal) to get best distance vision I can and wear glasses for near/intermediate. I don't know if II could be a candidate for monovision. Never tried contacts and now at 53 with cataracts both eyes hard to test that out.I read the aspheric have best outcome for no halos and glare. Other than one fixed focus anyone know of any other downsides? Thanks."

Cataract,Failed At Achieving Mini-Mono; Now What?,"After implanting IOL's in both eyes to achieve mini-mono, I've ended up too miopic. Scheduled for lasik ""touch-up"" on June 28, but not liking the options. Can anyone advise me of a possible solution?Briefly, I am 58, nearsighted from childhood, and was wearing progressives 24/7. Developed cataracts in both eyes. First surgeon was gung ho for setting distance in both eyes. Without much thought or understanding, I had surgery on my right eye on Dec 2015 and emerged with 20/20 vision. But I knew immediately I could never give up the remaining close-up vision. After much research, I realized mini-mono was right for me and undertook a lengthy contact trial to make sure I could adapt. I did wonderfully with -1.0. My goal was mid-range vision so I could see my bedside clock, car dashboard/navigation, grocery shelves, and TV. The challenging part was that I also hoped to be able to at least read an ringing cellphone ID or incoming text--if not perfectly. I fully accepted I would probably need glasses for reading a book or long computer screen use (I am a journalist). It's exactly the kind of mini-mono you wanted--and got. So I switched surgeons, finding one who supported mini-mono, had ORA and included Lasik touch-up if goal was not reached. On April 28th, I had the left eye done---and wouldn't you know, I ended with monovision and way too myopic (-3.0). My eyes now don't work together, I'm utterly disoriented, and feel like I have this ""white-out"" blindness on my left side. What I do have is excellent close-up--at the expense of mid-range. Don't really understand the optical numbers (tho' I've tried), but here's what I know: Right eye after IOL: 20/20 distanceLeft eye after IOL: -3.00 (goal was 250) Diopter difference between two eyes: -3.5 (which is too much for them to function well together)Surgeon recommended I do another contact trial of -1.25, -1.0, -.75 and -.50. Turns out -.75 yields great mid-range, but I can barely read cellphone, holding it at 22-24"" away (longer than my arms!) Is there any solution? The journey has been so long, I've been without good vision or proper glasses for 18 mos., and I'm tired and depressed that I've ended up here--especially after all the money, time, and discomfort.Thank you for any informed responses. Most grateful! "
Cataract,Prescription leeway for monofocal iols and laser adjustment ,"After my cataract op last October my left eye has come out: Sphere: +0.5, Cylinder -0.75 x 10. I am wondering whether a laser adjustment could reduce the prescription to 0 or -0.5, and whether it could also cure the astigmatism. But first need to know the margin of error to see whether such an adjustment might take the prescription down further. I think the surgeon and the optician both consider I am chasing perfection and that the adjustment would be best made by glasses - and I don't mind wearing them !NB My original prescription was -15 sphere, and I think this may affect the degree of accuracy or a laser adjustment."

Cataract,"Lose a ""slight"" bit of near vision. What is slight?","Had traditional cataract surgery Sept 2016. Left eye post op was amazing. Color and clarity like nobody's business! Right eye post op, my vision has never been worse. While I dont know my numbers right off hand, I've always been nearsighted. Only reason I saw the eye doc was on account of blurry vision and I wanted to make sure there wasn't serious trouble. Doctor said my cataracts were very slight and could easily get by for several years w/o surgery. He followed that by saying there wasn't any reason to wait until they got bad. He'd asked me how I'd like to have perfect vision without glasses to which I answered of course, but it didnt really matter as I've worn glasses from age 4. This is where he told me that he'd take away a ""slight"" bit of near, thus increasing the far. He went on to explain that I'd probably need readers for close up tasks. So far, I've washed my hair with the dogs shampoo, brushed my teeth with diaper rash cream, and taken the Rx I have for sleep in the morning. (With the latter, it wasn't carelessness but rather jumping letters). I can drive without my glasses which is kind of cool, until dark. So blinded by lights I don't dare drive. Prior to surgery, I'd never seen floaty things or had something I can only explain as sheer curtains that linger after I blink. While reading, letters appear to shift. Some of the fluid from the back of my eye is seeping over to the front, so that's one of the floating. While all of this I'm told is normal-and no doubt it's true-its hard to believe there is no correlation between the onset and the surgery. My cataract surgery was traditional and done with the scalpel. I didn't think it was possible to make laser precision correction without a laser so why didnt he just remove the cataracts?Any opinions? Thank you!Had traditional cataract surgery Sept 2016. Left eye post op was amazing. Color and clarity like nobody's business! Right eye post op, my vision has never been worse. While I dont know my numbers right off hand, I've always been nearsighted. Only reason I saw the eye doc was on account of blurry vision and I wanted to make sure there wasn't serious trouble. Doctor said my cataracts were very slight and could easily get by for several years w/o surgery. He followed that by saying there wasn't any reason to wait until they got bad. He'd asked me how I'd like to have perfect vision without glasses to which I answered of course, but it didnt really matter as I've worn glasses from age 4. This is where he told me that he'd take away a ""slight"" bit of near, thus increasing the far. He went on to explain that I'd probably need readers for close up tasks. So far, I've washed my hair with the dogs shampoo, brushed my teeth with diaper rash cream, and taken the Rx I have for sleep in the morning. (With the latter, it wasn't carelessness but rather jumping letters). I can drive without my glasses which is kind of cool, until dark. So blinded by lights I don't dare drive.

Cataract,I have floaters in my eye what can I do about them? I have had clear lens replacement surgery on nor,"These floaters look like squiggles when I look right but I have a multi focal lens transplanted in my eye and my natural lens was sucked out. This was 3 years ago and I am very happy with the result, except from these floaters I have just seen in the last few daysHas anyone else got this???"
Cataract,Cataracts with blended vision lenses,"I am scheduled for cataract surgery and am hoping to be a candidate for blended vision lenses. I wore one monovision lens years ago when i only6 needed correction for reading. it worked well for years until my far vision deteriorated. eye surgeon's nurse sent me home with a near-to-intermediate monovision lens to try (to make sure my brain would ""accept"" the blended vision option).I THINK my brain immediately accepted this immediately upon inserting it in my eye but I'd like some opinions... Though a bit blurry, I can now read the computer screen and big-print in books. However, driving was a challenge with the contact. Last night I removed the lens on the contact lens side from a pair of Dollar Store glasses and and wore those with the monovision contact in and that made driving a bit better. I'm guessing that, since only half my vision is being corrected with this trial contact lens that this is to be expected & that once the other eye is corrected for distance, I will be ok but I'd like your opinions on that...Also, when I put on the $ Store glasses (with the glass on the contact lens side removed), my reading and computer vision got even better.If this means I'm accepting the monovision, I'll move forwarded on the ""blended vision"" option the surgeon is presenting. (I'd hoped to go to thye Symfony lenses but they are out of m6 price range). I'm eager to stop wearing the trial monovision contact lens since driving with it is a challenge. Though I can see things IN the car quite clearly looking down the road is blurry. Looking forward to opinions and advice."
Cataract,Unusual shaped eyes.,"I had symfony lenses implanted last week electively.. I am now a J1 (near sited) Doctor wants do the second eye with a smaller lenses strength. A 29 1/2 from the 30 he used because of the outcome of the first eye and that I have unusual shaped eyes. He also wants the first eye to settle out for 3 months. If it is still too near sited, then he is suggesting laser treatment to get me to a J5. He also said he doesn't recommend changing the lense because it is a higher risk than the laser. Not thinking I like all this messing around. Comments? "
Cataract,Use of contact lens in one eye with iol in other eye - high myopia,"The surgeon has just written to suggest the use of a contact lens in the right eye, to use the existing monofocal iol set for distance in the left (non-dominant eye).The right eye is -15 sphere. -0.75 cyl x172 6/6+ The left eye (with the iol is +0.5 sphere = 0.75 cyl x10 6/6+There is a small cataract starting in my right eye, but vision seems reasonably good with glasses.I tried a distance contact lens in my right eye briefly in the optician's consulting room, but the vision wasn't very clear - the optician thought that might be due to the small cataract. Therefore the result was not conclusive. The range of focus seems greater in my right eye - either because the spectacle lens has a larger range of focus, or because I have a very small amount of accommodation left. (I am 63 years old). My concern is having to wear different glasses, or progressive glasses with a small area to see clearly at near, armslength and full distance focus.My work involves reading, smartphone and laptop (near), playing the organ (armslength), reading students' music while teaching (about 3-4 ft away).I have posted previosly, but am starting a new discussion about the combination of iol and contact lens.

Cataract,premium lens that is available in the UK without reduced contrast ,"Has anyone come across a premium lens that is available in the UK (privately), and that does not have reduced contrast, nor problems with night driving ?

Cataract,Tecnis Symfony Anyone?,i just had a Tecnis Symfony implant today. I am curios if anyone has this lens in their dominant eye without correcting the other eye as yet. My goal was to eliminate my 1.5 readers and keep my excellent distance vision . Thinking I may have made a mistake in not going with the Tecnis Multi focal first since it supposedly can give sharper near and far vision. Just wondering if anyone can tell me how their near vision is with just this one lens. 
Cataract,Multi focal contact lens confusion?,"I'm hoping those with more knowledge of contact lenses can clear this up.I underwent cataract surgery last week on my right eye and had a monofocal iol implant set for distance. So my distance vision is good but I can't read my smartphone or a book. I've been experimenting with different contact lenses in my left eye prio to surgery in that eye in a few months.my left eye needs a -6.0 contact lens for distance and when I have one in both my eyes have good distance but no intermediate or near. When I wear a -4.0 in my left eye I have poor distance in that eye but can see my smartphone and watch but still can't read, both eyes together give me distance and intermediate.Today I took delivery of multifocal contacts -6 with high add, however when wearing them they're just like normal -6's, i.e. good distance but no intermediate or near.What's wrong? I was expecting to have both distance and near with these contacts.cheers!"
Cataract,Advice needed...,Hi! I had laser implant surgery in 1993 when I was 18 and following the surgery up to now (today) my vision with glasses has always been just short for the UK driving requirements.. I was wondering since 1993 has much changed with advances in Cataracs and is there anything that could possibly be done to get me down one more line on a Snellen chart.. When I was discharge in 1993 I was told that all has been done that can be and my brain has not responded due to being born with the condition and being impaired for 18 years since birth... I have not been back sincend and was wondering if it's worth me getting refered from my local GPS. ..Or not to waste my time... Any advice would be greatly appreciated.. Hi!

Cataract,Yag Capsulotomy,"Hi all. Recently been diagnosed with Posterior capsular opacification (Pco) 2 years after refractive lens exchange and have been scheduled to have a Yag laser capsulotomy. My near vision in one eye gradually started to become a bit cloudy/misty and my optometrist said this was due to pco. It wasn't until just now I was wondering is it normal for pco to only affect near vision? My distance vision is totally unaffected and I'm wondering has anyone else on here had the same situation. And if so, did the yag clear the near vision problem without compromising the distance vision? The reason I'm concerned is that it has taken nearly 2 years for my distance vision to settle into a stable state and I would hate for it to go now! Cheers all.Hi all.

Cataract,Symfony set for mid range (-2?)?,"I've been myopic since 3rd grade, wore glasses until 15 and then hard contacts exclusively until in my 50s it became annoying to use over the counter reading glasses. Changed to single vision glasses and can look underneath (without tipping them) to see up close really well. Have not needed or gotten used to progressive glasses. Have to read in bed on my side since herniated disc years ago, but easy to see a book up close without glasses. Also don't have the problem of seeing details in the mirror or the shower without glasses or magnification. Since my prescription is around -6, I have ""superpower"" close-up vision without my glasses. Also have astigmatism.Now on in my early 60s I need to get the cataract in my left eye fixed. And I've been told that I will then want the other eye done as soon as possible after because otherwise the difference with two different modes of correction will be too big and unpleasant.The idea of not being able to see up close without glasses is somewhat terrifying. Since I have been delaying, the Symfony was approved and I did all the measurements and then delayed again. It seems like a 16"" close-up focal point is as close as I can hope for if all goes well and that's too far for reading without glasses. I'm not even sure if it would be good enough for seeing small details/small labels in daylight without glasses. I'm more willing to wear glasses all the time than to constantly try to adjust with reading glasses on and off during the day.I thought if I could get the Symfony set at say, -2, I could get a closer focal point of maybe 12"" or 13"" without glasses and then continue to wear glasses during the day and maybe even get a progressive pair that would also give me the kind of close-up vision I have now. But I was told that because of the way the Symfony is configured, trying to do a progressive correction over the top is very hard. I was told the most they'll do is -.75 and -.5 ""micro monovision"" to extend the range a little.Or I could go with a monofocal at -2 or -3, which would definitely be an improvement of my distance vision and give me a closer reading distance. But that I would need progressives or computer glasses. Has anybody been through this? What did you do and how do you feel about it? (Maybe I could use armless reading glasses in bed and a magnifying mirror? And get progressives that are clear on top and progress to +4 on the bottom?) "
Cataract,Problems with surgery results - on way to 2nd fix,"A little history. During surgery on 2nd eye, Doc says he nicked something (not comforting) so I would have to use drops instead of the shot. It was a monovision procedure. After the distance eye was done, I found that straight lines weren't straight in some places. When reading license plates, a letter might be dropped or one might be slanted. His fix for this was a quick laser procedure to both eyes (10 minutes tops) that did in fact help part of the problem. I think he tried to trim the back of the new lens to remove a wrinkle with a laser procedure. Now, he may have helped the issue a little, but overall vision is worse. I can't read traffic signs until i'm too close in my opinion. Fortunatley he has a plan: PRK in a couple of months.Anyone have experience with this sort of issue and is the PRK the right next step? My confidence isn't as high as it was when this all started 6 weeks ago. "

Cataract,choosing the correct lens for cataract surgery,"I have been trying to find what people think is the best route to go with my second cataract surgery. My first was done almost 3 years ago. I chose to have it done because I also had a macular pucker and I wanted it cleared up so that only the pucker was the problem. I had surgery on that in January and my vision is quite a bit better but will not be any where near normal.Everything is still blurry but best at vision for about 10 feet away. I asked the Dr about getting the right eye for close up work. He really didn't want to do that and is suggesting intermediate. Before presbyopia set in I was normally bi-focal with one eye near and the other far sighted. I want to be able to do computer work, reading and handiwork without glasses. I don't mind wearing them for distance. I was given the choice of Crystelens (?)+ $1900, Symfonic + $3800 or standard + $0. We are retired and I could manage any but it would be somewhat a pinch with the Symfonic. I'm worried that if I go with the intermediate, I'll need glasses all the time.

Cataract,Laser touch-up,"After my cataract operation my right eye came out +0.75 or +0.5 sph, -0.50 cyl, axis 15, Base 6/6+Would it be advisable to request a laser touch-up to adjust it to be 0 sph ?I think the margin might mean it could go down further, say to 0.5 sph, but would that be a problem ? The other eye hasn't yet been done, but is scheduled for July. I plan to request normal distance (I suppose 0 sp). My original prescription was very myopic - sph -15 (I am not keen on having a distance lens in one eye and a reading one ibn the other in case I don't get used to that, and it wouldn't cover middle distance anyway.I think the two eyes will not be quite the same strength anyway, and so should together give me a slightly greater range of focus, which will be useful.The surgeon mentioned multifocal lenses but said he didn't recommend them. A friend has trifocal lenses and is pleased with them."
Cataract,is there a way forward after Catarac Surgery???,"Hi! All.. I'm new to the Forum.. Been scrolling around whilst sitting in on a rainy bank holiday Monday. Glad I found this and I've seen lots of interesting information on here.I was born with Congenital Cataracs and had laser implant surgery with IOL's fitted back in 1998.. My eye sight never improved a great deal. It improved.. But, not enough to learn to drive etc.. I was basically told that my brain got too used to seeing the way it always see and then discharged and that was that.. The local Optician gave me glasses which help a little. .. I was just wondering all these years later if this is the end of the road for me... Or... is there any new ways of improving eyesight following a past op... I've been waiting for these cars that drive themselves to arrive (ha ha)... "
Cataract,Looking for feedback on cataract lens options,I will need cataract surgery. Thought I had settled on Symfony after my consult with surgeon however concerned about glare after visiting our family optometrist for my daughter today. She indicated she's had many patients after opting for premium lenses who have problems with glare and starbursts. She would stick to Monofocals. She said my pupils are a bit larger than others and this would contribute to my having issues with glare. Now I am more confused than ever. Guess now is the time to second guess rather than after surgery. Any feedback would be welcome.I will need cataract surgery.

Cataract,Problems after cataract surgery,"I had cataracts removed from both eyes within the last 4-5 weeks. Since I previously had Rk surgery about 20 years ago, I was told my vision would most likely not be 20/20, and that I would need to wear glasses to read/do computer work.

I really can't tell if this blurriness is improving or not. At different times during the day it seems to be worse.

Cataract,Symphoni Toric lens near vision,"I had a symphony Toric lens implanted one month ago. My distance vision has improved each week and is now 2020. My intermediate vision is pretty good and I can now work on the computer without glasse and is now 2020. My intermediate vision is fair , But I cannot read anything near. I have been told that my near vision may improve by a friend who has the same kind of lens. The doctor is recommending another type of lens for my left die and then a laser correction to take care of the astigmatism. Night driving is a real challenge due to the starbursts. Has anyone been able to see in improvement in night driving after a period of time with this type of lens as well as an improvement in near vision? I would appreciate knowing. Thank you"
Cataract,Clouding after cataract surgery,"Hi everyone on here, my question is before i had cataract surgery i always noticed a clouding or a mist with some black spots especially when lying down and just following it when i moved my eyes slowly. I asked the optician what this was and she said it was basically the ageing process and deteriation of the lens. So my question is why after cataract surgery do i still see this clouding and mist exactly as before, yet i have had new lenses. "
Cataract,Symfony Lens... Laser or Conventional Surgery,"Can the Symfony Lens able to be inserted using Conventional Surgery or does it have to be Laser Cateract Surgery? Is one surgery better then the other?I am trying to decide on what type of surgeon to choose based on Convensional or Laser?Also, can an astigmatism be corrected during Convensional Cateract surgery? "
Cataract,Rings of light in cataract surgery,"Hi to everyone concerned about cataract surgery and the rings of light you get. I was also suffering with these rings of light after cataract surgery in both eyes. On my check up visits i asked this question several times and the usual reply was your brain will get used to this. So wondering whether this was a fob off i had to have reading glassess because i only had distance lenses fitted ( national health), so i asked the optician what was causing the rings of light. He said because you only see the rings of light in darker light or at night is because the pupil dilates to let in more light which causes you to see the outer edge of the artificial lense and to be honest that made sense and was a much better answer than the eye clinic gave me. But all in all for those worrying about cataract surgery its a minor problem to worried about and for me the results were brilliant now having 20/20 vision in distance. Driving without glassess and being able to wear sunglassess while driving is a luxury for me, plus no more frustration with struggling to see hardly anything. The thing to remember is your own lense has flexibility where the artificial lense has none."

Cataract,Cataract surgery with astigmatism.,My eye doc wants me to have cataract surgery. As it was explained to med there is only a injection into the eye to numb the eye. It sounds painful to have a injection in the eye. Has anyone had cataract surgery with injection only in eye to change the lense to eliminate cataracts while awake?
Cataract,Retina problem after cataract surgery,"I had my cataract surgery on my left eye last September. I left that doctor because he belittled my complaints. When I told him colors were all wrong with that eye, he told me to adjust my TV. When I told him that I couldn't see well with my left eye and everything was white and distorted and driving was difficult, he told me to put a patch over that eye to drive. My new doctor since September, first found that I was allergic to cataract drop, Durezol and my new glaucoma drops, Combigan. Because of the allergic reaction, some damage had been done to my cornea. That has stopped. He also referred me to a retina specialist. My retina is so swollen and inflamed that I can hardly see anything with my left eye. I have had injections in my left eye, but the doctor says he can't operate until the retina swelling goes down. I goggled cataract surgery resulting in retina problems and found that happens sometimes. My advice to anyone who has any symptoms such as mine, keep complaining to the doctor and find another one if the doctor trivializes your complaints. I am hopeful, but needless to say, I am worried and scared that I may lose my sight in my left eye. Time will tell. I live alone and get Social Security, but I have no pension, so I need to work until I die in order to keep my home and live a life. I had my cataract surgery on my left eye last September.

My new doctor since September, first found that I was allergic to cataract drop, Durezol and my new glaucoma drops, Combigan. Because of the allergic reaction, some damage had been done to my cornea. That has stopped. He also referred me to a retina specialist. My retina is so swollen and inflamed that I can hardly see anything with my left eye. I have had injections in my left eye, but the doctor says he can't operate until the retina swelling goes down. I goggled cataract surgery resulting in retina problems and found that happens sometimes. My advice to anyone who has any symptoms such as mine, keep complaining to the doctor and find another one if the doctor trivializes your complaints. I am hopeful, but needless to say, I am worried and scared that I may lose my sight in my left eye. Time will tell. I live alone and get Social Security, but I have no pension, so I need to work until I die in order to keep my home and live a life. "
Cataract,Considering Symfony IOL,"I have been reading many of the Symfony discussions here - thx for all of the great discussions!I have wore glasses since I was 10 and am now 61. Just went to (well known and respected) surgeon last week for consultaton re. Lasik. He recommended Symfony in my right eye. Here are my specifics:Left eye dominantNear sighted in rt eye and far sighted in my left eyeI believe (not 100% confident as the 1st intern type dr. gave it to me and it is not signed and dated - he gave to me as an fyi) my prescription is: +2.25 - 0.75 x 162 +2.0-0.50 - 0.50 x 041 +2.0I thought I was near sighted in my right and far sighted in my left but the above seems to indicate different?Anyway, I have always known my left eye was ""better"" and my right eye was weaker, in all aspects (near and far) it seems. Even with glasses the right eye never gets to where it can see better than my left eye, near or far. So my question/fear is this - ""Is it possible for me to not wear glasses at all for reading, computer of distances by having Symfony installed in my right (weaker) eye only and then doing nothing to my left eye? The Dr. did say that eventually I may want Lasik in the left eye, but we should just see how it goes after having the 1st eye done. He also said that he thought I wouldn't be required to have readers, that I might want some mild readers for prolonged reading and/or computer work, which I am accustomed to doing several days per week.What does everyone think? I appreciate everyone's thoughts."
Cataract,symfony lens,Does anyone know a tennis player who has had the Symfony lens implanted? 
Cataract,Mono Lens Reading or Distance?,"I posted a few days ago about being scared about cataract surgery and I've started a new discussion because I need advice on which lens to have.Been to see a surgeon and been told that I can't have a multi focal lens due to health isssues so Im afraid I've got to have a mono lens. Must add here that I have cataracts in both eyes, but my left eye is a lazy eye and that one is low grade, its my dominate eye that needs surgery.I thought about what I would do if this was my only option before I saw the surgeon and I had decided on having a lens for reading and just have to wear glasses for driving. I assumed that my distance vision would be like it is now with my reading ability to be better, but the surgeon told me I am expecting too much and my distance will be blurred. Giving me the example of if I entered a large room with people in I would see people but would not be able to see their faces clearly. I can do that now! I then went to see his secretary to be told that he is just giving me worst case senirio in case I am dissapointed and sue him, so I am really confused what to do for the best. I've got to go back tomorrow for scans and measurements to be taken and I am booked in for surgery 23rd of this month. So I've got to make my mind up very quickly about this, must say I do feel rushed about this, its not like going out and buying a pair of shoes. Once its done there is no going back. So I am turning to you lovely people for any advice or experience of having near vision lens fitted and if you are pleased with the result. Thanks for reading"

Cataract,recent cataract surgey ,Hi I had my left eye done 3 days ago. I was meant to have the right eye done the following day but I refused after being unable to see from the left one. I couldnt see anything but grayness. I was told I had edema when I went back for a 24 hour follow up appointment. I can now see colours but my vision is still very blurry and there appears to be no improvement in the last 24 hours. Is this normal? There's some horror stories on her.

Cataract,Cataract monofocal IOL far or near?,"I am 67 yrs old, I have cataracts both eyes, left eye cataract level 3.5, right eye 2.5, the doctor asked me can you read with out glasses I said yes then he picked nearsighted at -2.50 for monofocal IOL. He says I will be able to read at 16"" not more or less without glasses.He discuss about arm's length he thinks to add from -2.50 to 2.75 so I can read alittle bit closer to 13"" without glasses.Sadly, I know I will not be able to see close up as I can see upclose to 6"" without glasses, both eyes are different, left eye at 5"" and right eye at 6"". I believe it is because with cataract it can cause to have second sight. so maybe I am not really nearsighted??I am not sure which is best near or far for momofocal IOL.Right now I can not read without glasses at arm's length and I can take off my glasses read upclose at 6"" not farther I need my glasses to read or cook or read computer.I read some here on this site and find some people prefer far distance rather than near.I am confused which is best? I don't mind wearing glasses after surgery.Help me understand what is IOL power, is that RX?If you choose far distance is it required to add eyeglasses RX on IOL? can you have without eyeglasses rx in IOL? Is the IOL power is same as rx eyeglasses?I don't understand how it works the IOL power for far distance?Is it possible to have iol inplanted wthout rx correction and then wear correction glasses?Thank you, I am just learning and just want to make the right choice.oh here is my RXOD Sph -2.75 Cyl -2.00 Axis 070 add +2.50OS Sph -3.00 Cyl -2.00 Axis 093 add +2.50Am I myopia? thank you,"

Cataract,Dry eye problems following lens replacement,"i chose to have lense replacement in January as my contact lenses were becoming increasingly uncomfortable and I also needed glasses for reading, cooking, cleaning etc. Multi focals were recommended to allow me to be glasses free.

My left eye is for distance and right eye for reading etc. After 9 weeks my vision is superb although I still have the feeling my eyes are working separately. I have been assured my brain just needs time to come to terms with the change! The major problem I am having is with dryness in my right eye. I use lubrication drops all day long but have a constant feeling of grit in my eye. I also take omega 3 oil every day as recommended. Again I have been reassured with time this will pass!

Cataract,Post Cataract surgery!,"My mother had cataract surgery on her left eye on 21st Jan 2017.Phaco procedure. We had 3 follow ups, first one a day after surgery, otherTwo were, a week n 2 weeks later. She did complain for a lil shadow at theEdge of the eye, but kind negligible, so she never mentioned it to doc. But The pain, and the swelling were there, doc discarded it by saying it might beBecause of cold or sinus. But on 14th March 2017, after more than a month,my mum started seeing shadow moving, floaters, flashes, or flickering lights,The doc said, everything is fine, n it will reduce with time, or you will get usedTo ignore it. I am confused, n i am afraid for my mum. Can anyone tell me What we should do."
Cataract,Posterier capsular opacification,Hi allRecently been told that I may have developed pco in my right eye. I had iol surgery 2 years ago and have recently been having issues with blurry/hazy vision. Optometrist reckons its pco causing the problem. My question is to anyone out there whom has had pco. Can the symptoms vary? As sometimes the vision is not too bad yet other times it is particularly hazy. I would have thought that pco would cause a consistent permenant problem until it is lasered away.Thanks
Cataract,catract grade 3,"About 11 years ago the optometrist found I had Grade 1 subcapsular catracts. Fast foward this year an optometrist found the catracts are now Grade 3. There was also a scare where a tonometer reading was high with suspected glaucoma. Another few reading done few weeks later showed it normal.My question is on catract. The reason why I went for a check up was because I suddenly realised I didnt need reading glasses anymore. I now have this anomaly where one eye is long sighted and the other short sighted both at 175 degrees. My vision is however not blurry and crystal clear even without glasses.So does it mean that if the catracts are grade 3 one needs surgery?Why is my vision totally clear if it Grade 3 ? ( not that I'm complaining )Secondly, should I get an appointment to see an eye doctor anyway.Appreciate any advice and info.Thanks"
Cataract,Contemplating surgery,"I am 65 and have had new glass seven months ago, extremely nearsighted and am schemed to have cataract surgery in a week. my eyesight has changed in seven months and I need new glasses, but am worried about retinal detachment due to extreme nearsightedness, would like to hear some thoughts."
Cataract,My recent cataract surgery on the right eye,"I had my cataract surgery recently about 9 days ago. Immediately after surgery it was very blurry, upon the first post op visit the doctor mentioned since I had dense cataract, it takes time . Upon my second post op visit, the Doctor mentioned I have corneal edema and gave the Muro 128 5% saline solution in addition to the other post op eye drops. Inspite of the saline solution, my vision did not improve much and I have my third post op visit scheduled in couple of days. I am afraid and concerned I might not have any good news. The doctor asked for a 7 day period and she was very confident but I passed that 7 day period into the 9th day now. The vision improvedcompared to the first day after surgery after 3 days, but from 3 days to 9th day it stayed stable more or less. I could seethe pics but not clear and I can recognize colours , I couldsee distance objects blurry and cloudy, very near objects ok. I got implanted the regular monofocal IOL. The doctor mentioneddue to dense cataract more phaco was used and surgery was little longer and because of that I got the corneal edema.I never knew about the cataract complications due to dense cataract surgery thought cataract surgeries were so popular and 98% successful. I got it done for my mom and father both eyes few years ago and never heard of this corneal edema and it was very successfulI request the experts and anyone who sees this message looking for suggestions. What is the max time or ideal time I should wait before going for the next steps ? Did anyone has similar situation and any luck and improved vision after 2 or 4 weeks ? The least thing I want is the corneal transplant."

Cataract,Cataract Surgery..Lens displaced..Rubbing against Cornea,"Hello ladies,I have come to you wonderful ladies for help regarding my eyes. Hope you can steer me in the right direction or shed some light upon this. I had my cataract surgery last year in January and the Dr. who performed the surgery misplaced the lens so now my right eye is extremely sensitive to sunlight and brightness.The lens is close to my cornea and its rubbing on the cornea which has resulted in a scar on the cornea and I also have some swelling. The lens needs to be readjusted or repositioned. I don't want to have another surgery to fix this so is there any other option. Has any one of you gone through this type of situation? I am really upset and so disappointed because I thought that after surgery I would be able to see clearly and everything would be fine.Thank you so much and I am grateful for any suggestions or tips. Have a beautiful day and make it a great day!Blessings and love,Pam "
Cataract,Lost distance vision ,"I had a Symfony toric lens implanted in my left eye. Right after surgery I could see perfectly at all distances. Something I could not do before surgery and right eye is still like that until next surgery. My concern is that after 4 days my distance vision deteriorated to the point where I cannot read street signs, etc. Doc didn't seem concerned, said eye was dry. Wondering if this had happened to anyone else and if you got your distance back. I'm mostly concerned because it was so clear for the first 4 days. This is day 10. I'm super happy with near and intermediate, but really want to be able to read street signs."

Cataract,Glare following cataract operation,"I have had a cataract operation in my left eye - the iol is a Rayner lens. I am getting considerable glare, especially noticeable when out of doors during the day, which makes everything appear cloudy. At night I get a ""fringe"" around car headlights and other bright lights. I also get some general mistiness for the first 30 minutes or so after waking up (I think this may be normal after the eye been closed while sleeping and am not sure sure if this is related or not).I was previously very myopic (-15 / 0.75 x 170 6/6+). The prescription in my left eye is now +0.50 / 0.75 x 10 6/6+One of the eye doctors at the hospital said the glare is due to my now having a crystal clear lens in my eye, which is letting through more light than the natural lens would.I have a pre-op appointment with the surgeon who is going to operate on the cataract in my right eye in April or May. I have previously posted concerning the prescription, but the glare is a different issue. "

Cataract,double vision after cataract surgery,Had my 2nd cataract surgery a week ago and have had double vision ever since. The surgeon stated it may have been caused from hitting a vein with the needle and the blood pooling on the muscle and bruising it. He also said my double vision is at a 10 degree and doesnt feel time will heal this so he is recommending I go see a muscle specialist to have surgery. Has anyone had a simular experience? I believe the needle hit the muscle causing this double vision. This is very debilitating.

Cataract,One week out from cataract surgery with Symfony,"I had my left eye done one week ago (the cataract in my right is fairly minor). My surgeon insisted on laser-assisted surgery. We both felt the Symfony would be a good choice of IOL for me. We aimed for some residual myopia for better near vision. I'm not sure yet what exactly we hit. I was highly myopic (~-11) so it's harder to hit the desired refractive error precisely. Overall the vision in that eye seems quite good functionally; I'm not able to read the newspaper but aside from that functionally it's great. There's still some shadow/fuzziness on the eye chart, but it's just a week out. The surgery itself went great. I had an ICL implant that had to be removed, but that was clean and easy, the hexis was perfect, the lens is perfectly centered and seems well aligned. There's no inflammation or edema in the eye (some inflammation at the incision as expected). I do have a moderate amount of astigmatism, so a toric Symfony lens was used. Prior to surgery my left eye was pretty bad; I relied on my right eye for everything, so it's quite nice being able to see clearly out of both eyes. Eye pressure is great (14 in the operated eye and 12 in the other, but it varies day to day). I'm hoping my near vision improves over the next couple of weeks.I had my left eye done one week ago (the cataract in my right is fairly minor). My surgeon insisted on laser-assisted surgery.

Cataract,Post-cataract Surgery Issues...,"Within a span of 20 days gap, i(40-year-0ld) had undergone cataract surgery for both the eyes between Dec 5, 2016 and Dec 20, 2016.In the right my surgeon implanted Alcon monofocal lens (SN60WF 22.5D) for distance vision; and the left eye with Alcon monofocal lens (SN60WF 23.0 D). My surgeon, said since the other eye was set for distance vision, let's keep the right for LITTLE NEAR VISION. In spite of my concerns, she(surgeon) said, it was only little change power and that i would be doing good. This was the scenario.

Unable to watch /view the TV clearly that is about 3 feet away.3. Left peripheral vision is obstructed4. From the day 1 after the operation, i am seeing a filmy white layer slightly above, left-side,and below the pupil of my eye.5. If i glance at left-side, the layer is being pushed further left-side and able to view clearly. If i turn eye to the right-side, the filmy white layer or a black shadow obstructing my vision.6.

Sometimes, light rays are glittering on the top portion of both the eyes.5. Edge of lens on top and right-side of the eye is visible.[u]What would be my problem""?[/u]1. I feel that i am neither good with near vision or distance vision. How would it be corrected? My surgeon says no problem with eyes, and operation went on well. No Retinal issues, she claims.2. When would i get rid off heaviness of eyes at peripherals?3. Is something wrong with the power of monofocal lens that are being implanted into my eyes?4. Would these black crescents disappear by any chance?5. How long i have to see the edges of lens?6.

This changed to -4 SPH, -1.25 CYL & 155 AXIS post op. I had a monovision IOL fitted and set for reading distance, meaning I still need glasses for distance.My question & problem is I can see pin sharp at 25 / 30 cm (without glasses) and also pin sharp in the distance (with glasses) but there is a gap between the both where my vision is blurry (about 10 feet!) I can't even see the computer screen.It is vital for my work this this 'gap' is sharp as I need to be able to see clearly at mid range distances (either with or without glasses).Can anyone offer advice, I'm really reluctant to get the second eye done until I get the first one useable for work.Thanks."
Cataract,10 days postop,Had cataract surgery on right eye and the Symfony lens implanted. I work in a medical lab and the lights are very bright. My left eye is having a hard time keeping up with the new eye. My eyes feel really strained. I put sunglasses on and it seems to help. Has anyone else had this problem? I am supposed to have the same thing done to the left eye on Feb 13th
Cataract,Cataract Surgery Concerns,"20 years ago I had 4 cut RK in both my eyes. I have been wearing glasses for the last 15 years. In September 2016 I started having issues where mid and distance vision deteriorated to the point that I had to look out of the bottom of my glasses to read highway signs. Vertical and horizontal lines had a slight shadow alongside the line. I had surgery to remove cataracts from both my eyes. At the consultation I was offered the opportunity to upgrade the lens implant to a bifocal lens or an accommodating lens. I was told that my distance vision would be corrected with any lens I chose. I was also informed that since my prior RK correction was minor, if I chose to upgrade to an accommodating lens that I may have an opportunity to correct for near, mid and far vision. The downside would be that I may require reading glasses. I chose to upgrade and pay a premium for an accommodating lens. My left eye was done first a TRULIGN IOL lens was prescribed prior to surgery. The morning of the surgery the surgeon said that he decided to implant a normal Crystal IOL lens and that if required he would complete a laser correction at a latter date. Two weeks later a Crystal IOL lens was implanted in my right eye. Both implants are: AT-50AO, Diopter 25.50, Optic Dia 5.0mm, Overall Dia 11.5mm.I am now experiencing vision issues for mid and distance vision. I can still distinguish a shadow on lines. Near vision is good. My 2015 and 2016 vision prior to cataract surgery was:OD +1.25 +1.00 165 Add+2.50OS +1.50 +1.00 179 Add+2.50After surgery:OD -2.00 +1.75 178. Add+2.50OS -1.75. +1.25 180 Add+2.50The technician and optometrist that examined me after the surgery said that they can understand why I am concerned. My surgeon suggests that the outcome is within the acceptable range. The surgeon provided a prescription as noted above. It almost seems like they had in stock IOL's to use. I am not sure what to think and do not have access to experts like you. I would value your opinion.Thank you,"
Cataract,Light streaks at 45 degrees months after cataract Right(OD) 0.25 -0.75 145 +2.5 Lesurgery,"The length and width of the streak is dependent on the brightness and width of the light source -- in only the right eye. Looking at a bright light bulb will provide a streak crossing most of my visual field (always at the same roughly 45-degree angle from upper right to lower left) exactly the width of the light bulb. The streak is perfectly straight and seems to fade away at the far ends. Opthalmologist just shrugs. Optometrist suggested perhaps I'm seeing the edge of the implanted lens, but wouldn't that be curved? I don't know the brand of the IOL, but it was toric with heavy astigmatism correction. Prescription before surgery: R +1.50 -3.25 x100 L +4.50 -3.75 x077After surgery: R 0.25 -0.75 145 L 0 -0.5 85Different doctors may account for the difference in angle.What might be causing these streaks and is it possible to get rid of them?

Cataract,redness and inflammation,"Hi, I had cataract surgery on my left eye on December 19th. I began having problems with the drops for my eyes. An allergic reaction? I think so.

So i did, and still inflammation on the outer membrane. looks like gel on my eye, and redness. Feels stiff (if that makes sense). i will be calling doctor again tomorrow as I dont' know what to do.

Cataract,Symfony Lens after cataract surgery ,This is my 4th day since cataract surgery. I had the Symfony lens inserted. How long does it take for the feeling of a foreign object to go away? I am scheduled to have the 2nd eye done in 3 weeks.
Cataract,Cataract surgery and restore lenses fitted ,So around 13 years ago I had cataract surgery in both eyes and new restore lenses popped in. At the time left with two very different prescriptions and the surgery was not great... I was left needing middle distance glasses for the pc. My close reading was ok as was the far distance. However I am finding both eyes so cloudy and find close distance very difficult. I keep wanting to rub the eyes. Much like I did when I found I had cataract. Does anyone know if havin new lenses you can still get cloudung
Cataract,Fluctuating distance vision after RLE exchange,"Hi all. Wondering if anyone else out there has experienced the following: I had bilateral iol surgery about 18 months ago. Was fitted with AT Lisa trifocal lenses. Very pleased with results, perfect near vision (which was my ultimate goal) however, intermediate and distance vision is quite unpredictable. Sometimes the distance vision is perfect and other times it is probably below driving standard. I can have periods of almost a month with great distance vision and then it will go back again for no apparent reason. Usually though, the fluctuations are throughout the course of a day, whereby it can be crystal clear for a few hours then returns to its sightly blurry state for most of the day. Also I recently discovered that when my distance vision is blurry, if I put very slight pressure on the eyelid at the bottom right of my right eye (the dominant eye) the vision goes crystal clear again until I let go. I do have slightly dry eyes and use Hycosan eye drops regularly but really don't think dry eye is the cause of these fluctuations in my distance vision, if it was then why does it never have an affect on my near vision and also how would applying slight pressure to the base of the eye be helping the dry eye problem? I was thinking that there may be residual astigmatism in that eye that is being 'corrected' by applying pressure but if that was the case would the distance vision not be blurry all the time? Or can astgmatism vary throughout the day. Sorry for the long winded post. Hi all. Wondering if anyone else out there has experienced the following: I had bilateral iol surgery about 18 months ago.

Cataract,Monofocal vs Multifocal - cataract surgery - ACK,"Hello all. I just found this board and it seems to be a wealth of information.I am 45 years old and have never worn corrective lenses.I was recently diagnosed with a rather large cataract in my left eye. When seeing with two eyes, I see fairly well. But the one eye is very cloudy and hazy. My eyes get fatigued quite easily. I work at a computer screen for my job.I had a consultation today and the doctor recommended a multifocal lens. I also have a slight astigmatism so he would do laser cataract surgery and correct that. He explained the risks with the multifocal - mainly the halos and poor night vision. I also understand it is $2500+ more.I think the reason he recommended the multifocal is that I really would prefer not to wear glasses. I never have - and would prefer not to start now. He did say that I may need some sort of reading glasses in 5-10 years.But I'm confused. Sounds like the monofocal lens would be better - but then I would need glasses.One more thing. Doc was surprised that I was doing 'as well as I'm doing with my vision.' I guess my right eye is compensating - so I don't have too many issues at night and this is tolerable.Any thoughts or ideas? Obviously I want to do what is best for the long haul. Thank you in advance!Hello all.

Cataract,iol prescription after cataract surgery,"After the operation my left eye came out at +0.50 sphere, -0.50 cyl, 10 axis. It is slightly over-corrected - eg nothing less than about 10 feet away is in focus, but it is very clear for night driving.My right eye will be operated on soon - what strength should I request ? I would prefer not to have mini-monovision as the operation result is permanent, but if the eyes are balanced, they will both be over-corrected. I am not sure whether laser touch-up would be a good idea as my corneas are thin due to being very short-sighted. I would prefer not to go for mini-monovision in case I don't get on with it, and of course the operation is permanent !"
Cataract,Allergic reaction,"I'd like to put out a sort of public service announcement. I had cataract surgery on my left eye at the end of September. I was given Ilevro and Durezol drops to put in the that eye. Also, the doctor thought it would be a good idea to switch my glacoma drops from Timolol to Combigan.Weeks after the cataract surgery, my vision in the left eye was no better than before the surgery. It actually seemed worse to me. My right eye also became inflamed so I was told to use the Durezol in the right eye also. I was referred to a retina specialist for the left eye and the retina was found to be swollen and inflamed. Yesterday, I went to my new cataract doctor, because the one who did the surgery wouldn't even admit there was something wrong after the surgery and treated me like I was an idiot. By this time the vision in the left eye was worse and the right eye was a bloody mess. The new doctor said the inflamation in both eyes was due to the fact that I was allergic to the Durezol and the Combigan. He said the cornea in the left eye had some damage due to the allergic reaction. I am back to using the Timolol for glacoma instead of the Combegan and now I use Prednisone Acetate instead of Durezol. My right eye has improved somewhat overnight. Please heed this warning. The problems you are having after cataract surgery may be due to an allergic reaction. I wish I had known that could happen, since I may have permanent damage to my cornea. Time will tell on that. "
Cataract,Recovery after cataract surgery,"Any advice please? A relative is apparently going to need cataract surgery in the future , possibly not for a while, but the family are stressing and saying she will need to have carers or go into a nursing home to recover. I have no idea what this op is like and would really value some info as to how people managed at home with day to day stuff especially if they were on their own. From what I have read, the need for a carer seems a bit extreme especially for a person of 60 odd, but I don't want to underestimate things if it really is that bad! Any experiences would be helpful, thanks. "
Cataract,Cataract op needed if not interfering with my life?,"Stopping to think now, I believe I may be being rushed into two cataract operations. I responded to a mail shot which offered eye examinations at home through the NHS. The optician came and said I needed new glasses, which I bought. However at the same time she mentioned I had cataracts in both eyes. I paid of course for new glasses which seem fine and would not have thought about cataracts, and have no difficulty seeing or doing every day tasks, if she had not brought it up. I've just been to the NHS hospital although the department is actually a company within the hospital and not of the hospital. I was told I needed both eyes done but nothing was explained. A nurse made me do the usual eye test - I couldn't read the three lowest lines at a distance. The nurse only made me try and read these lines. I could read about three top lines. It was done very quickly and she didn't test my reading. I only spent a few minutes with the doctor. However coming home and reading NHS leaflets on the internet I don't appear to have any symptoms which indicate I need surgery. My day to day life is not disrupted. I don't have blurry vision. I have also read that I may need new glasses after the operation. I find it rather disturbing that the same woman who prescribed new glasses for me, which are fine, also referred me to have eye surgery when I might have to spend more money on glasses after surgery. What do people here think?"

Cataract,Blinded By The Light?,"I""m a few months out now from the operations and appear to have a ""light"" issue. All my life I've been a little sensitive to lights that are ""too bright"",. Lately while in the house I've found myself shielding my eyes from light coming in the front windows when the blinds have been opened up too far. And at night although it did not intially bother me much the glare of oncoming headlights and their halo effect is almost painful. When going outside I wear good quality sunglasses and do just fine, no pain no problem. I understand they make glasses you can wear at night that designed to eliminate or greatly reduce that halo effect from oncoming car lights.I've decided to go ahead and buy them. At first I thought it was just a minor inconvenience but now I find it actually boarding in painful and feel relieve when concoming traffic goes by and I no longer have that painful halo to look at.If the nighttime glasses provide me with as much relief as the daytime sunglasses do I'll be very happy."

If I blink fast, this something either glides past my retina moving up or glides past my retina moving down.The sensation is that something is in my eye behind the intra occular lens and is sliding around.As long as this something does not stop in front of the retina, my vision is no different.Does anyone recognize this oddity?Thank you"
Cataract,Am I suitable for Symphony lenses?,"Sorry if this question ends up being a bit lengthy but I would like to know if I would be suitable for Symfony lenses. I have an astigmatism (which I am told is average) but am also extremely hypermetropic (right eye +10, left eye +11). Over 2 years ago I had a consultation with an eye surgeon to see if I was suitable for Intra ocular lenses. He said I was and recommended monofocal lenses but I decided not to precede with the surgery. At that time I asked about Symfony lenses which had only recently become available. He said that he had never used them and that they wouldn’t be suitable for me as a toric version wasn’t available and my prescription was too high. I now know that toric versions are available which causes me to question his other assertion about my high prescription. I suspect that he might have wanted to try Symfony lenses on patients with more normal prescriptions first and so was unwilling to recommend them to me. I have tried to find out whether or not my hypermetropia would be a barrier to me getting Symfony lenses but find myself baffled by much of the terminology. I have also contacted the clinic where I had my original consultation (which belongs to the only company in the UK to offer Symfony lenses at present) but after 3 phone calls they still haven’t reviewed my case and given me a definitive answer. Or would there be another lens which may be suitable for me?"

Cataract,concerns after complications during surgery,"I had cataract surgery a week ago. THey got the cataract out, but the lens capsule collapsed due to zonular dialysis. The surgeon left the capsule in the eye. He then inserted a phakic IOL in the anterior chamber. My vision is 2200/20 in the operated eye, the other eye is correctable to 20/40, so I was put on short term disability. The surgeon said that in 8 weeks he will remove the stitiches which will improve my vision, but that the capsule is now floating in my field of vision, so he may have to laser it. Is lasering the capsule the best solution? Is this just bad luck on my part or was this some kind of error/mistake? I am out of work now for the 8 weeks at least, which is extremely frustrating and boring. I can't see well enough to do almost anything I enjoy, and I feel confined to the house to avoid any chance of infection. Any suggestions?

After coming out i felt sick and dizzy and took to my bed for a week (normally i am very active) the drops were like puttin a red hot poker in your eye and when i read they make you sick and dizzy and not having a lot of success puttin them in anyway i stopped them, i have seen the consultant and she didnt seem to notice, just said carry on with the drops ha ha. My eye is still very red and very sore but she said i was doing ok and have to have a stitch out maybe in 3wks if i survive that long, please someone tell me it doesnt hurt i want the truth and to know what to expect. I am not having the other eye done should a cateract appear. Thanks in anticipation"

Cataract,My blepharitis and dry eye routine,"The first thing I do when I get out of bed is to wipe both eyes with warm water. I use a double sided oval pad (from Boots) one side for each eye.I then use Hylo drops, one drop in each eye. Later on I wipe my lashes with Optrex for sore eyes (most of the optrex range has the Benzalkonium Chloride in them) that they talk about on this site. I did very reluctuntly try the wipes that are recommended on this site but I was very nervous about it as I felt my eyes had taken such a beating already and I did not want to add to it so I tried it for only a short time.Throughout the day I put in the Hylo Tears and depending on how my eyes are I wipe the lashes with the Optrex, how many times depends on the day/weather/traffic etc. I am certainly doing it much less than I used to. Sometimes at night I may also use a Lid Care wipe, particularly if I wear make-up, I have just started using eye shadow after several years of not doing so and when I have put it on and I am aware that my eyes/lashes are not so comfortable I very carefully put the Optrex on a tissue and just gently wipe the lashes and I seem to be able to tolerate the eye shadow and I am then off out.I am telling you my routine because I feel I have broken the back of the condition and it just might help someone else as I found this site so helpful when I was starting out. Interestingly and disappointingly when I saw my Doctor she said whatever you are doing, keep doing it because it has clearly worked. She did not ask or was the least bit interested in what I had done. She had a student Doctor with her and turned to him and said this patient had bleharitis/dry eye quite badly which is a condion which is a bit of a nuisance I said Doctor it is far more than that!! Pity, as I can't see much change happening in the medical field, so clearly we have to help ourselves and each other. I hope this helps someone. "
Cataract,Are there any surgeons that can fixed botched cataract surgery. ,"My cataract surgery was botched. Wrong prescription was implanted in my right eye & I needed to have a piggyback lens implanted, vision is still not perfect.

Cataract,Cataract issues,"I had a Random retinal detachment in may 2016. Four days after surgery I was told I had developed a very large dense cataract, which they expected, just not so quickly. In October 2016 I had lens implant cataract surgery and just got stitches removed last week and was told I have a macular hole that must have developed between the two surgeries. I saw the original surgeon today and he was of little help. He's very rude and condescending, but I'm at his mercy since I have no insurance. He said he could not confirm a macular hole and couldn't explain why I have such poor vision. My eye feels awkward, like it's out of place,and my vision in that eye is like looking through a fishbowl. It's very frustrating!!! The second surgeon said I'm still not legal to drive and ignores any questions I ask. One of his nurses faxed paperwork of my medical information and surgery to somewhere without my consent or knowledge and when I questioned her on it she became very rude and said she would just call their attorney. I don't know what to do. I'm about to lose my job and my license because I cannot see. I can see people, but I have no focus, or depth perception. Glasses are useless. I don't know what to do . I'm paying 100% out of pocket for this since I have no insurance, but they're being so nasty to me, and my vision is so much worse. They act like im faking my bad vision. I a!

Cataract,double vision after cataract surgery,I have been posting about my double vision now going on almost 3 weeks. My eye started to improve to the point where there was very little double vision in that effected eye. This morning I woke up with the double vision back to being as bad as when I first took off the patch and now with slanted double vision. Anyone out there experience anything like this? My surgeon is not a muscle specialist and maybe sending me to one in my area but the one's in the area unfortunatley do not have good reputations.I have been posting about my double vision now going on almost 3 weeks.

Cataract,Cataract left behind after surgery.,"I had cataract surgery one week ago. Immediately after my surgery, I could not see. I just saw my surgeon (one week later) and I still cannot read his eye chart. He cancelled the planned cataract surgery for my other eye and said he thought my cataract had not been removed because ""it stuck to the capsule."" I don't see him again for two weeks and I want to have questions ready that will lead to a remedy. For example: Should I wait so long to try to correct the situation? Will too much scar tissue develop? I have heard that if the lens is in too long it can't be removed without extensive damage. Right now the lens is kind of squishing the cataract down and to the inside of the eye. "
Cataract,seeing rainbow circles around lights after cataract surgery,I just had cataracts removed from both eyes yesterday and my vision is blurry and I see rainbow circles around lights. Is this normal?
Cataract,Today I had a laser procedure to take away the cells that regrew after carapace removal.,I recently had my cataracts removed a new lenses put in. New dark cells regrew over my eyes and I had laser surgery today to get rid of them in my left eye and next Wednesday I have it done in my right eye. Then we will try and figure out what is wrong that they can't fit me with glasses. I have been retested twice and had 2 different pairs of glasses made and I cannot see with either pair.

Cataract,Help re Cataract Recovery,"I had my first Cataract op in June, prior to my op I spoke to friends and family members who had either had the op or knew of someone who had had the op and practically nobody had had any bother after the op so why me. After my first eye op I had 4 days of extreme agony then it settled and was absolutely fine but I did at the time of extreme pain vow not to have my other eye done. Since my eye was OK after a few weeks, I decided to have my other eye done, wish I hadnt, it was a different doctor, not that that should have made a difference. Can I mention, I have read lots of reports on your page from patients who talked about eye shields etc, I was never given or suggested buying one which I would have done gladly and prior to op, I think this may have helped, anyway my second cataract op which I had 2 months after the first op has left me really DOWN there was, the same as the first op, pain, but with this one it was a different pain, it was at the inner side and outer side of my eye and was at its worse when my eye was closed, I dreaded going to bed when I would have to close my eyes to go to sleep. can you imagine. I also have slight distorted vision on the outer side of my eye and like a very fine web over the eye. Its now 7 weeks after the op and the pain is almost gone, hopefully not to return but who knows, but my eye feels heavy all the time, can live with the distortion, its very slight and can live with the very fine web and probably have to live with the eye feeling heavy. After all my moan and groans I do have to say that the vision in both eyes is good. I wonder if this is any help to anyone who has had the op cause I would like to have known of anyone who had similar symptoms as me."
Cataract,Negative Dysphotopsia Unsuccessful Cataract surgery,"I hate it! These unwanted images are driving me crazy! You've got to do something about this.the reality is that dysphotopsia has become the number one problem following uncomplicated, successful cataract surgery. And it doesn't go away easily once a patient becomes focused on it. In my experience, if a patient has perceived this as a major problem for three months or more, it won't improve without intervention.Unfortunately, many of these patients are incredibly unhappy. Quite a few end up in my office after seeing five or six other doctors, most of whom have told the patients that they're crazy. ""Your surgery is perfect,"" they say. ""There's nothing wrong here."" This has entirely the wrong effect, making the patient angrier and even more focused on the unwanted images.the number of patients who actually require an intraocular lens exchange because of dysphotopsia is only about one in a thousand. However, the number of patients complaining about dysphotopsia is closer to one in ten. It's also worth noting that the percentage of patients complaining depends upon whether you ask them about this problem. A lot of people are unhappy; they just don't say anything to the doctor.

Cataract,Cataracts at 32 after chemotherapy and decisions on surgery,"3 years ago I finished treatments for cancer and two weeks ago I was told I have ""spiral-shaped"" cataracts in both eyes and the doctor suspects they are from chemotherapy. I have high degree myopia that never really has stabilised (it is -7.25 diopters each eye) and can be corrected to 20/30. I have worn prismatic lenses for the last two years to be able to read or do any near work at the computer and such.I've always associated cataracts with aging and so many co-workers and family members have been through the surgeries without complaint that I assumed I'd simply be able to have a new lens implanted in each eye and that was that. Done!I don't see much of anything at night (except for bright lights) now not even with glasses or my contact lenses in and have had to stop driving. The glare from the sun at particular angles around dawn and dusk is overwhelming and I cannot keep my eyes open and there is also quite a lot of a halo effect around streetlamps. He said this is due to where the cataracts are forming which is on the periphery of each lens though one side it affects the periphery and a slight amount of the center. I cannot understand why he feels I am not a good candidate for this surgery. Not that my insurance would even begin to cover any of the cost yet anyway. Apparently they only will cover removal of much larger cataracts only regardless of how thr affect your vision. I was told that I only could have artificial lenses that would be set to correct my distance vision and that as a result my near and intermediate sight would be significantly affected and likely not correctable with any sort of lenses.This surgeon is my second opinion and the first doctor told me nearly the same as this one. But I have read many many stories of people with much greater levels of myopia than myself who have had good results. I don't know anyone who has lost near and intermediate sight that cannot be fixed with simple reading glasses.He tells that should I decide against surgery I'll become legally blind which I'd much rather not have happen! Yet if I have surgery I may lose all ability to do near work (with my job being heavily computer-dependent, this is not an option I'd rather choose either!). He said the sort of cataracts affecting me would cause legal blindness but not affect close work any more than it is already affected. And I asked him so what do I do? I have a bit of time to decide, a year or two, but I thought why not, and came here to ask of others' experiences. Do you have any ideas on what I have been told? ETA: By second opinion I mean as in surgeons. My regular doctor I see for yearly eye exams made the initial discovery of cataracts and I did not like what he said, nor what the first surgeon said. So, when I heard it yet again from this surgeon, I thought perhaps it's not the doctor who's wrong here!"

Cataract,fluid behind eyes,"I have not seen anything regarding the problem I am having. I too have flickers, floaters, teary eyes..but that's not my main problem.

If not, more shots.I also have some swelling that is apparent under the eye below the lashes. I can't even get glasses because why eye sight changes constantly. Has anyone had this problem? If so, I would really appreciate hearing from you. "

Cataract,Wrong iol?,"I had cataract surgery 9 days ago, and although my vision is clearer, I am nearsighted instead of the expected farsighted.

I strongly suspect that I received the wrong IOL implant. Has anyone else had this problem?

Cataract,Just had 2 cataracts done.,I went for my free eye test and was told I needed two catarcts done. No new glasses at the time but was given a prescription - which was of course of no good whatsoever. Do I get another free eye test when the six weeks have elapsed after the surgery? I will need new glasses then.
Cataract,Complication of cataract surgery--macular edema.,"I don't think I was specific enough in my first post. So, here's the story.I had cataract surgery on June 6 iin my left eye. Initially, I had flickers whenever I was in daylight, flourescent lighting, etc. (I still do) and I was told by my opthamologist to ""give it time."" I noticed a swelling below the lashes in my left eye the day after surgery, which now, almost 3 months later, has not gone away. Then came hundreds of tiny black bugs (floaters) and my eyesight seemed to change every day. I still do not see well. I needed new glasses, but the prescription naturally was based on my current eyesight, and since it keeps changing, the glasses were awful. and did not work. Words were jumping up and down and I could not read what was put in front of me.Finally, I actually saw the opthamologist's P.A. since the doctor was not available that day (which might have been a good thing) and when I told him my symptoms he immediately did a test called OCT and found I had macular edema. ...which means swelling and fluid had built up behind my eye. The test showed that the retina in my right eye was flat as a plain, but the left eye looked like it had a lump over it (fluid that had built up). So the next step was to give me anti-inflammatory, and steroid drops, and injections in the eye. He set up and appointment for the doc to give me injections in the eye. (Not at all painful.) I am supposed to get six of these shots every six weeks (maybe longer, I was told). I had the first one on Aug. 23. I've been reading the posts here in the forum and I didn't see anyone who has talked about this particular problem. Please let me know if any of you were diagnosed with macular edema and how it did or did not work out for you. I would really like to get some more input on this. I would appreciate it. Thanks to all of you who have had the patience to read this. "
Cataract,Why do i see better after cataract surgery then I have in fifty years,I recently had cataract surgery on both eyes completed. I am sure everyone has lazer done. I am not one for details but I haven't got a satisfactor answer from anyone at the clinic. Don't believe in miracles. and just what the heck did the lazer do to an eyes that haven't been able to read and see distances. I went in for surgery while I ask staff what is the lazer doing the only response was ask the doctor or the lazer is going to work on your eye. That is not an answer. I did get it the first room took pictures and broke up the cataract I think. Moved to the second room where blood pressure heart monitors and many people were available. I was never alone as I made the journey and things seem to have worked out. But I have yet to learn what the lazer actually did other then breakup the cataract. I know there was a lense implanted. If the correction was made with the lense then seems to be that It would have to be replaced every few years. But from everyone that I talked to said no they had the surgery done and never had to go back. Am I the only one with this puzzling question. Did ask the doctor when I went in because I thought I was getting the cataract removed and paying extra for lasik which i was told was going to fix the vision. They went and got the doctor. Who told me it is not lasik. But we are going to fix your distant vision. He being in a hurry and me being in the middle of the procedure said okay good to go. But I am still baffled.

Cataract,4 weeks since multifocal. Left eye not so great,"Hi everyone. So great to read all about the experiences although not always good. I'm from the England and the only site I can find with reviews of the lens replacement surgery are mostly raving about how fantastic it is. Well my experience so far is not so.I ll start by saying I'm a train driver. The reason I chosee to have surgery was to ensure my sight was kept at a constant level,as I was on the limit of what the railway allow for its drivers. So I would lose my job should my vision deteriorate any more. I had choice of monofocal or multifocal. I opted for multifocal as I was told the low ad lense would be good for me correcting all vision both near and distance. Well 4 weeks later....right eye great meets in facts exceeds railway standard, but left eye does not meet standard. I was told I'm reading one line lower than the minimum standard required. I'm assured it will be ok in time. Or if not that laser yag would be an option to rectify. It's very worrying time as I'm now off work until this left eye improves. My question is will it? Very scared as iv paid a lot of money and I feel iv put myself out of much loved job. Am I panicking too soon? I also find by evening my eyes go fuzzy round the edges not focus properly. I find I need go bed very early as what's point of staying up if can't see properly. I now need to sit much closer to the TV than before. MY near vision is amazing but I feel everything else is very poor. Has anyone had this yag laser? Was it sucessful? As I'm concerned about having more done. Look forward to any replysHi everyone.

Cataract,Cataract Complications,"I had cataract surgery on one eye but the sugeon, after breaking up the cataract, could not remove the cataract pieces. This left me seeing a big blur.Two days later I had surgery on the same eye by a Retinologist who removed the pieces of broken up cataract. Afterwards I could see but my vision is blurry. I am 20/200 in the operated eye which sounds bad but I am seeing much better than with the cataract. This eye had always been my lazy eye and I never had good vision in it. 20/40 was about as good as it got with glasses.I have read several articles that state it can take up to a month for the vision to clear. Anyone have a similar exerience?"

Cataract,Confused after cataract surgery,"I have high myopia and had cataract removed from right eye earlier this week, ostensibly that it was the cause of blurred near-sight vision (was unable to read anything with right eye). Have early cat in left eye but not affecting vision at mo. Surgeon has implanted an IOL with no power, meaning that I carry on wearing my existing glasses - and in fact, distance vision is already fine. I realise that it is very early days and my right eye is yet fully to recover, but I suspect the near focus problem is still there! Confused and somewhat anxious...."

Exactly after cataract surgery lens replacement surgery was planned by the surgeons.

My doubt is can't a surgeon suggest whether the persons eye is fit for lens replacement surgery before the surgery itself. How a doctor say that he can't do the lens replacement surgerysurgery after all the damage is done. Please reply and clear my doubt.

Cataract,My son had a traumatic cataract,Just before Xmas something blew int my Son's (6 years old) eye. It punctured the cornea and he developed a traumatic cataract. The lens was removed and a stich put in the cornea. As I understood it the next operation would be to remove the stitch and replace the lens. At our last clinic appointment this was confirmed by the doctor. He then bought in a consultant who changed the plans and his next op will be for stitch removal only (he has to have a general anaesthesia to ensure he stays still). I didn't follow the reasoning for it all (but didnt realise until we'd left) and have tried to contact the consultant who said they would call back.... Haven't heard back yet and was wondering if anyone here had any experience? Why would they delay lens replacement? His eye is otherwise healing well and he has had no infection or other problems.

Cataract,cataract surgery,"All my right eye sees now is white. After my surgery yesterday as i was leaving i was amazed at the colors. I could see clearly. By the time I got home it clouded up.

Even with reading glasses on, I see only a white page. i feel like crying and now in a panic. I do not see this as a side effect on papers they gave me.

Cataract,monofocal iol mistake?,"I'm 4 days post- op cataract surgery. My right eye was done 10 yrs ago and is ok considering it has orbital fracture. My left eye which is also my dominate eye was just done. Before the op we discussed iol's. Before leaving I heard him tell assistant -2 iol. Later i was concerned what that meant so started researching. Found that this was a close up reading lens. Called office and asked and confirmed this. Told them I didn't want this and wanted same power as right eye which was distance. Even made appt. with doctor and made sure of change. Later at surgery once again confirmed the lens to be for distance. Now 4 days after surgery. Since 2nd day ive had clear vision from 8 to 24 inches. Can even read very fine print. From 2 ft. on its a blurr. Trying to drive is horrible. Lights are difussed and 3 times large then normal. Since its dominate eye it wants to take over. I have to cover left eye to do anything except read. Doctor says blurr is from swelling etc. but why is there no blurr close up? I believe he implanted the reading lens instead of distance. After all my attempts to make sure. Each day vision stays the same. Am i wrong? Is this normal? Did he make mistake? And if so, can he put distance lens in and take this one out? Seems like the sooner the better before this lens heals into place. Thank you for quick advise.I'm 4 days post- op cataract surgery.

The near sigth is focused and clear but the medium and long sight i think it got less clear that at first. Anyone experienced something like this? "
Cataract,Anyone have Second surgery to remove first IOL& replace. ,"My apsle was punctured during surgery. The IOL is sitting on top not inside the capsule. Now after (Dec.2016) surgery I have a black curtain coming down from the top of my eye. Enough to be notice & annoying. Now Dr. wants to go in & replace the lens to just a clear lens. I had multifocal IOL's put in but didn't work. I still have to wear glasses. The eye is also a bit blurry.Has anyone had a second replacement? I understand it's a big risk, could cause blindness. And if it was going to be done, it has to be within 3 months of first surgery. It is now more than 5 months. I wish someone out there could shed some light on this. I've been reading all the comments, it helps to know I'm not the only one with problems, some are worse than mine. But no one has said they has second surgery."
Cataract,Cataract surgery last Jan. and Feb. and still cloudy,"Hi, my wife had both eyes done last year in January and February. She had the following laser ""clean-up"" it was called because of cloudy vision. She went through all drops and directions for compresses and was told by the doctor ""I don't see any reason for it other than maybe dry eye"". Then was sent to another clinic. There she was given more drops for dry eye, and then was scheduled for scraping and polishing of her cornea because she was told that the dry eye has created a pitted surface that he could fix. Which was done early this year in January. Afterward, following the surface proceedure and having many drops to take...an extended follow-up period followed due to ""not yet healed"". Then yesterday the doctor said there is nothing else he can do surgically and he doesn't think it is worth doing anything to the other eye""...bye bye. It felt like being sent out the door of a hospital after being told you have amnesia. My heart just sank for my wife as I know how troubling and disappointing this whole experience has been when she expected no trouble...only success. Now we do not know what to do or where to go. We would go to the best eye clinic in the country...if we knew where that is. Please do not reply ""Dever's Clinic in Portland OR""...been there, done that."
Cataract,Varifocals after cataract surgery,"I opted for a two dioptre difference between my eyes after cataract surgery. My unoperated eye has a small cataract which doesn't affect vision.The operated eye had developed a white cataract plus had started to wander ie not looking the same way as the good eye.Got used to sight in one eye. Plus partial sight for about two years.Post surgery I struggled to get used to my new vision.The operated eye is working but had several sea sick moments . Distant glasses were eventually OK.I've worn varifocals for about ten years and have loved them. Two opticians told me that they would no longer work. Persuaded one to give them to me and they are now OK if sitting still. Very disorientating if moving in a busy place. Not good for work as I am a teacher.Got re referred back to the hospital. Surgeon was quite aggressive but now confused as to the reason varifocals no longer work.He said that the lense itself ,monofocal,meant that varifocals wouldn't work, claimed that varifocals were a money making scheme. I wanted to say that I had been to two opticians but didn't get the chance.He eventually offered to do my good eye in order to make them match. I still feel unsure what to do. Didn't have a proper conversation with the surgeon.."
Cataract,"Light-sensitivity, smarting, stinging, soreness three months after surgery.","I had both cataracts done in February, no problems post-op, quite a steady recovery, vision is good. However since the ops I'm suffering terribly with light sensitivity and a feeling of smarting all the time. My surgeon says I've got blepharitis and that it's unusual for the light sensitivity to last this long but that it will definitely go. He said the reason I'm so light sensitive is because of being allergic to the post-op steroid drops, Maxidex for four weeks, so I then had two weeks of Dropodex no-preservative drops as a treatment for the steroid drops allergy. I'm following the blepharitis regime and the eyelids are almost back to normal in that they aren't swollen any more but they are still a little sensitive. I'm using gel tears to ease the symptoms which is comforting to a certain extent. However the worst symptom is the light sensitivity which is excruciating on bright sunny days and can also be pretty bad in the evenings. Up to two weeks ago I was still wearing sunglasses to watch TV at night, and the last few days I've had to revert to sunglasses again at night if I want to watch TV. The eyes sting and smart and last night the stinging and smarting was so bad I couldn't read and could only just about bear to watch TV with sunglasses and squinting. Has anyone had these symptoms post-op? What did your surgeons say? What did they advise? Did it help? How is it now? Any advice would be very welcome. Thank you."
Cataract,waiting for piggyback lens since Feb. 2016.,"My right eye was over corrected when I had cataract surgery on Feb. 11, 2016. I was told by Doctor that I would need a piggyback lens implanted to correct blurry vision. Doctor states that FDA has to approve the new equipment the manufacturer had to purchase that manufacturers the piggyback lens. I was told that it probably won't be approved until July. Has anyone else had to wait to get a piggyback lens or should I go to another doctor for another opinion?"
Cataract,Cataract post-op eye problems with styes,"I had first cataract surgery 3/1/16 and second 4/3/16. I am still having problems with blepharitis, chalazion (dr. Described it commonly known as stye) especially on the first eye. 3 days ago I was in her office and she manually squeezed infection about 4 times. Painful. Said I was just predisposed to have this problem, and I would have to continue the lid scrubs which I had been doing, plus the dry compresses 8 to 10 times DAILY, that the surgery did not cause the condition. I told her I am 73 and have never had a stye. Then she suggested it could have been caused by all the post op meds. Can anyone give me hope from experience? "

Cataract,Can you tell me about Cataract surgery? Doctor says I can have it but nervous,"Hi- I am a 63 year old woman who has Astigmatism. I can see ""okay"" without my glasses but have progressives and absolutely need them to read. My vision itself is not that bad, but I have a lot of trouble driving at night and a couple years ago the doctor said I had the beginning of Cataracts but it was not bad enough to do surgery. Meanwhile I love to drive but now rearrange plans to not drive at night and it is interfering with my life. Today I saw him for my eye exam and told him again about the night driving and he said ""Okay, do you want the surgery?"" I did not expect this, and had heard a few years ago about how terrible the surgery was, the down time, the pain, having to lay down and keep the eye covered, etc. He said it isn't like that at all now, it takes 10 minutes, you are put under, no pain, and only one day off work. Is this true? Has anyone had the surgery? I would have one eye done at a time of course, but if it really is that easy I would love to have it done as it would also fix my Astigmatism. However, I know it has a slight risk but really would like to hear from people who have had it done! I am in very good health. Thank you!"

Cataract,Costs Involved with Cataract Surgery,My 81 year old dad was told he needed cataract surgery for both eyes. He is covered by medicare and his secondary.

I would have thought the measurements were included in the surgical costs.Thanks for the help. This is new territory for us.

Cataract,Radiating lines from point source of light,"I had cataract surgery in my left eye yesterday with a lens to correct my bad shortsight (9 dioptre). I caught the reflection of the sun this morning from the car and noticed two lines radiating out from this point source. Since then I've noticed the same effect on any point source such as LEDs, small halogen ights etc. The result is infinitely worse then the very minor cataract that I had.Will this go away in a few days time and is just the eye settling down?"

Cataract,Need opinions on choosing an IOL.,"I need cataract surgery in one eye. I currently use monovision contacts and it works fine, though I think my far vision is compromised a bit.The eye that needs surgery now, where the cataract is worse, is my ""reading"" eye. My prescription says -1.75. (The other eye corrected for distance is -5.0)These discussions can get pretty technical I've noticed, and then you lose me!My sister got IOL lenses for far distance only and while she loves her great far distance vision she hates needing reading glass for Everything now. I would too. (Though she did get one contact after the surgery for reading, so monovision I guess, but decided she missed that perfectly clear far vision and stopped wearing the contact. She decided to get used to using reading glasses.)My sister-in-law got multifocal ones and loves them and I was all set to get them but when I saw the doctor yesterday he didn't recommend them and said most docs have stopped doing them. That they are no better than multi-focal contact lens (and I have Another sister who hated THEM!).The dr said with monovision my middle distance may suffer and I told him it doesn't now with monovision contacts. He said that's because my eye still has some flexibility to adjust but the replacement lenses won't have that.So then I decided to go with the far-distance-only ones and just get used to using reading glasses or try the one contac option.But today a pharmacy tech I spoke with threw a wrench into my plans because she has monovision and loves it. She only needs reading glasses for very small print like medicine bottles (not for everything , like my sister does). And she has a pair of glasses she uses for night driving to improve her far vision.This is so confusing and the fact that this is permanent (basically) makes it tougher!Can anyone give me some feedback?"

Cataract,Unexpected Side Effects?,"Hello. On 2/24 I had cataract surgery on my left eye then again on my right eye exactly one week later. In between each eye, I managed to break my ankle, so my body felt like it took a beating. I don't feel as if I've bounced back. During my recovery period I developed thrush and some gum sores. This has left me feeling tired, heavy eyed and a general feeling of malaise. My blood pressure has suddenly gone up, as well. Priior to surgery, my blood pressure had always been normal and I never had thrush before. I wonder if the drops I had to use for 4 weeks in each eye had something to do with my elevated blood pressure, thrush, and malaise. Has anyone else experienced anything similar? I've since been to my GP and all bloodwork has come back normal. I've also been to my dentist and he said whatever gave me gum sores seems to be gone now, as he couldn't find anything. He did concur that I do have a mild case of thrush. "
Cataract,double vision after cataract surgery,will thisdouble vision go away it has been here since march they tell me to be patient. now i will wait for your answer. 
Cataract,Do I go ahead and have my other eye done?,"As I posted in another thread, after my left eye was done, I started seeing two lines radiating out from any highlights. They were very long and noticeable but as others posted after a while they seemed to disappear. However, I notice that they are still there although to a lesser extent. I had my post-op meeting with the consultant (it's now four weeks since the op) and asked him. He told me that it might be due to residual astigamtism and I am annoyed with myself for not asking him to explain because all my research into astigmatism talks about blurred vision.This is most definitely not the case with me as my vision in the left eye is pin sharp (I had a corrective lens inserted). So I think I am starting to lose faith in the consultant and am apprehensive about having the second eye done by him. I don't need it being done yet BUT and this is a huge BUT being in the UK and our NHS strapped for cash, by the time the NHS will agree to have the op done, I will really be struggling with my sight in that eye. I currently have private healt cover and they are willing to pay to have it done. Now factor in the letter I received this morning from Nuffield stating that their default position is for patients to share a room with up to three other same-sex people. As I type this I am starting to get stressed out again. Nuffield do say that one can request a single-room and indeed this is what I had last time and was perfectly happy in my own space, zoning out in my head and meditating and generally calming myself. I know I won't be able to do that if I am in a room with others wanting to make small talk. And what about all the pre-prep stuff...taking blood pressure and putting in the drops? Not very private.Also I have OCD with regard to bacteria and disease and last time showered in my room, got rid of my bacteria-laden street clothes and put on a gown. At that point I was happy in that I had done all that I could to minimise infection.I really am a very unhappy bunny at this point in time. I think on Monday I need to text the consultant and ask him to call me when he gets a moment and ask him to explain how/why he thinks it is astigmatism. Maybe I am wrong...I am open to input from you guys. I will also ring Nuffield up as the appointment is scheduled for a couple of weeks time to request a single-room. "

Cataract,"I have read many of your stories and thought I would add mine, as it seems to be a bit different","I am 60 years old. Starting in the fall of 2014 I started having major complications in my left eye. A bit of background info though, if I may. I had lazy eye in my left eye, since Childhood, which resulted in major near sightedness in my left eye. When I was 18 my Doctor told me that my right eye had compensated, and at that point my left eye vision, I guess wasn't all that bad, so He didn't recommend glasses at that time.Over the years my vision in the left eye got worse, where I eventually had to wear glasses. Nearsighted in my left eye, farsighted in my right eye, and an astigmitism in my right eye, and no fine depth perception, With glasses though I was able to live with it, and do well. Starting about 4 or 5 years ago, my vision in the left eye, was considerably worse, so I went to an optometrist, and he said that my vision hadn't changed that much since I got my glasses. So in leaving that place that day, I told my husband, that I was going to be blind in that eye I guess, and I would just have to live with it. I did until the fall of 2014, when one day I saw bright flashes of light, in my left periferial vision, like lightening. Then Large floaters and black tangled thread like floaters appeared, and it also looked like fine black pepper was sprinkling down the front of my eye, and then I had a snakey like floater that looked like blood. After a day or so I was really worried, so my Husband and I went to see an Optometrist that I had an appt. with, for an eye examination. He examined my eye, and said I had an emergency situation, and I needed to get to an Opthamologist.. He believed my retina was detaching, and he also said it looked like I had a pretty good cataract going on too. So off I go to University Hospital, to get the retina tear fixed. In the follow up checkups, it was determined I had a bad cataract, but couldn't have taken out, until It was safe, after the retina tear surgery. About six months later I had the cataract surgery, that required a stitch in my eye, because the cataract removal didn't go as smooth, and I got a super duper temporary lense. My vision hadn't never been so good. I was seeing beautiful colors and detail. It was like a whole new world. I told my Husband I bet the permanent one, won't be like that, as we couldn't afford one of those expensive upgraded lenses. I was right the permanent wasn't like that, but at least I could see. The Doctor said I would probably only need reading glasses. Well it didn't turn out like that. At one of my post operative checkups, I told the Doctor my vision was slightly wavy, so they looked at that, and determined that scar tissue, had formed where I had the retina tear surgery, so it was pulling at the back of my eye. She said as long as my vision was good, I could forstall future surgery. Well it has been a little over a year, and my vision is now just as blurry as it was before the cataract surgery, maybe a bit worse since I no longer have any near sightedness, in my left eye, which did make it possible to see up close.So I was wondering if there were anyone here, that could possibly tell me what could be going on. Is there some problem besides the lens, that replaced my natural lens? My new glasses aren't even much good.I am wondering if it is the scar tissue, that formed as the result of my retina tear surgery, that might be causing my vision, to deteriorate.I know that an appt. will have to made I guess, with the eye Doctor. We will be saving up, to pay for it."
Cataract,Does having a high bp a hindrence for catract operation?,I consulted doc for catract operation .They are asking me to reduce bp inorder to carry out catract operation.i am having bp of 180 .can u please clarify it .
Cataract,Worried about my eyes,"Since having a cataract removed two months ago, I am unable to read for long before my eyes get very tired and sore. There is no blurriness, however, just an inability to focus properly on the print. Reading is no longer a pleasure. Also, I definitely seem to have more lines around my eyes andI haven't worn any eye makeup since the op. The very thought of it is just too painful. I have done everything I was supposed to do including using the eyedrops,etc.,but am still worried about my eyesight. I have been back to the Eye clinic and the doctor there referred me to a Retina specialist who I am due to see shortly. I know most cataract operatons are successful and am very concerned that mine wasn't. Would just like to be able to see as well as before. Optician confirms my vision is much worse and there is nothing he can do to improve matters. Doctor at the eye hospital who has referred me to a Retina consultant thinks i will need to have another op. Has anyone else had this proble? Please let me know. Thanks.Incidentally, I went back because of soreness, brightness, watering of the eyes and general discomfort experienced. What questions should I be asking the Retina doctor."
Cataract,Wrong iol implant for cataract surgery? Want my near vision back!,"A month ago I had cataract surgery for my right eye with a single focal implant for far vision. I did not realize I would lose near vision focus until, alas after the surgery was over. About 95% of my life consists of near vision work, computer, reading, artist work, etc. I never had to wear glasses for close up or computer work before whereas I have worn glasses for distance driving for 40 years and have no problem continuing to do so. (Now I am left with blurry vision for even the simplest close up chores. I don't know what to do to correct this and what Imy options are for the left eye which also needs cataract surgery. I was told I wasn't a candidate for multifocal in my right eye since I have a macular pucker but it is probably an option in my left eye. Haven't been able to get a clear answer from the surgeon as to the alternatives so I am going to be researching finding a new surgeon for the 2nd eye and possibly to correct the first (before I go nuts trying to see my paperwork and computer!) Any insights most appreciated! Thanks in advance."

Cataract,My first cataract operation is in a few days: how restricted will I be in what I can do after it?,"I haven't been able to get on to anyone at the hospital for answers and in case they don't get back to me before Friday and my GP doesn't have the info when I see him tomorrow,, could others who've had the surgery please give me some idea of what activities have to be restricted and for how long?Anecdotally I've been told that I won't be able to drive for a week; bend down or lift anything heavy for weeks; or walk up and down stairs for varying lenghts of time.As I live alone I'm concerned how much help I should be organising and would appreciate info from others who've had successful surgery."
Cataract,Catarct Surgery / Eye Disease,"I had cataract surgery one week ago and my eyes are still very blurry, flickering, hurt/burning, side vision not good, I saw the local eye Dr. today and he thinks I have an Eye Disease in the back of my eyes, he wants me to see a specilist in eye diseases, but the Dr. that did the surgery wants to see me again at the end of the week. Has anyone ever heard of this."
Cataract,Doc says I require multifocal lens - I'm not so sure,"Hi, I live in Thailand and will seek treatment at a for profit, private hospital. I do not have insurance. Many of these hospitals have excellent facilites and doctors, but also many over test and over treat, simply to run up the bill.First guy I went to says I *require* multifocal lens - POD F (MIOL). The explanation as to why I *require* it was vague. Does anyone know if indeed in some cases monfocal is not a good option?Thanks. "
Cataract,after eye surgery,"my left eye after cataract surgery had the wrong power in the lense and at night when i drive i see star bursts from the head lights, I have another sergeon for the right eye and surgury came out perfect. He said he could fix the right eye and make the hole bigger and the glare would be gone . It would only take 10min with the laser. My left eye is okay because i can see close up with my left eye and distance in my right eye. Don't know if i should leave well enough alone. or go for this, Since my left eye is so good i can drive at night now. but it would be nice to get the glare out of that eye. Not sure what to do after hearing all this horror stories"
Cataract,Cataract surgery with high nearsightedness,"Hello, I am having cataract surgery in 3 days. I have cataracts, but they are very minimal and not really causing vision impairment.. I was choosing to have it because of my astigmatism and bad vsion, I am not a candidate for lasik. I have been doing a lot of research on the success rate of cataract surgery of paitients with high nearsightedness. I am really getting anxious because there seems to be a lot of risk involved. My eye Dr did say that he is dealing with human tissue and there are no guarrantees, but he didn't mention how much more at risk I am. Has anyone here have good results with high nearsightedness? : )"
Cataract,"My cataract surgery was not good, very blurry vision also sometimes when I move my eyes they flicker","Does anyone have that sensation after surgery and does it go away I had my second surgery last week. I am an oil painter that is my life and now when I paint if my eyes flicker I have to stop. The blurry vision is also driving me nuts. I see two eye Dr's because I live in the mountains the my Dr. that did the surgery is almost a 2 hr drive, so I see a local Dr. the local Dr. really has no answers. The Dr. that did my surgery said he corrected my vision so I would not have to wear glasses for reading but that was only once in awhile if the print was small, I did not need glasses for distance, now I need glasses for both. It is very depressing."
Cataract,"My Cataract surgury was not good, very BLURRY VISION","I live in a mountain community. We have one doctor that is almost 2 hrs away, everyone recommends as one of the best even my local eye doctor.I had my first eye done a little over two weeks ago and my long distant vision was not right and the doctor informed me because I did not want to use reading glasses it made my far vision blurry. He did the second eye few days ago and my vision is extremely blurred and it is very depressing I still need glasses for reading and now I am sure I will need glasses for distance. I did go to my local Dr. one week after my first surgery and felt things would clear up after I am done with my drops. When I got up this AM I felt my vision is worse. I never needed glasses for distants but now I do not know, the local Dr. told me after my first sugery I would need glasses, I am an artist and my vision if everything to me. I tried painting a few times since my last surgery and my vision is off, I am 75 and I am having a very hard time with all of this. I only needed reading glasses but only on occasions and never distant glasses. Now I need both. I go this Tues to the local Dr. for a ck up I Pray he will give some better news."
Cataract,droop over eye following surgery,"I had cataract surgery in mid-December and have been very happy with the result, except that recently I've noticed the skin over that eye is drooping to the extent that it's beginning to affect my peripheral vision.I've found one reference on the internet to this being a possible after effect of cataract surgery and intend to contact the public hospital eye clinic where I had the surgery, but I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced this and what was the outcome?"
Cataract,DRIVING A CAR AFTER CATARACT SURGERY,"When I had my first cataract surgery in December I was told not to drive a car until I'd had my 7 day checkup, but another patient I met later who'd had identical surgery at the same hospital wasn't told this, only to not lift anything heavy or bend over for at least a week.I'm having the second eye done later this month and would like to know other people's experience of this: I will of course ask the surgeon at the time for the reason, but would like some feedback here please.The reason I ask is that as I live at the top of a very steep hill which I can walk down but not get back up again bc of COPD, it was very inconvenient after the first surgery having to ask people to pick me up, take me places and drop me back at home. I don't see what harm could be done by me driving down the hill to the local shops and back up again."
Cataract,I've had cataract surgery 2 weeks ago and still blurry,"I had a cataract removed in my left ( distance eye) 2 weeks ago and my distance vision is worse than before the surgery. I know the colors are brighter but I can't see to drive. It's worse in the mornings and gets a bit better in the afternoon. My doctor says there is a bit of inflammation still there and that is what's causing this. He of course might be correct but it's frustrating. I have a few concerns, one of which why is it worse in the mornings and is the blurriest normal.im doing the drops he prescribed regularly bur don't see any improvement. I understand what he says but would have thought it should get a bit better each day. So far it's is just about the same "
Cataract,Blocked vision after cataract surgery,my husband had cataract surgery over 8 months ago. He has worse sight now than before and in his right eye his vision has a blanked out line that cuts off his sight below a certain area. The Dr. has basically blown us off after doing a laser procedure that was suppose to cure it. He still has the blanked out line of sight that he can't see below. We have another appointment this week but doubt the Dr. will have any solutions since he keeps ignoring the problem. We don't know where to go from here. 
Cataract,Eye sight worse one week after cataract surgery,"hi. I had surgery last week and was amazed how well I could see the next day. At my post opt appointment that day my vision was 20-40 and crisp. I was extremely near sighted so I was thrilled. A few days later I had an eye ache, bad head ache and sick to my stomach. Saw the dr who confirmed my eye pressure was elevated and told me to stop one of my drops that could cause this. Two days later my pressure dropped from 32 to 26 but my vision is now 20-50. The dr said that's because it is still healing. I am quite concerned. Should I be? Thanks!"
Cataract,Tell them that you are a driver.,An optician referred my wife to the eye hospital as she is developing cataracts. After her eye check the doctor asked her if she drives. When my wife said that she doesn't drive she was told that her cataracts can wait a bit but if she was a driver she should have done them now. A new form of NHS discrimination ? So even if you do not drive tell them that you do for faster treatment.
Cataract,Why can they only fix near or distant vision?,"I am going to have an cataract operation in a month or so (I am 57). The specialist said that with the new artificial lens, I have the choice of either perfect distance vision and needing reading glasses, or perfect close vision and needing glasses for distance, which is how I am at the moment.The specialist didn't seem able to explain why it isn't possible to have an artificial lens that will fix both the reading and distance vision so that they are BOTH perfect. Can anybody out there explain this to me please!"
Cataract,"Dislocated lens material after Cataract surgery, now Vitrectomy - some questions","Hi,I had my cataract surgery 3 days ago, but part of the cataract fell into the vitreous humour. After this happened, my surgeon called a retina specialist for Vitrectomy. He, however, covered my face entirely, and after I felt suffocated, I asked them to stop the procedure.They told me I was claustrophobic, and my oxygen level was fine, so I could not have suffocated. Given I am claustrophobic, they now want me to be under general anesthesia and be operated on for removing the remaining cataract.Q1. Was the cataract surgeon incompetent in not operating successfully? Or, can such mishaps happen due to the patient's eye health?Q2. Is it a standard practice to have patient's face completely covered and taped for Vitrectomy?Q3. What general advice/warnings would you give me in regards to ensuring that my eye is being looked after well prior to and post Vitrectomy?Q4. Given I have hypertension, what are the possible risks pertaining to my eye, if I am given an anesthetic?I ask this since I have been unable to get second opinions in my case, so will be very thankful for your response."
Cataract,Blurring in second eye after trivial lens replacement,"I am 54 and was a contact lens for distance and glasses for reading wearer with early cataracts. I have opted for Zeiss trifocals toric lens replacement. The first eye (left) was done 12 days ago and I could see fine through it at the follow-up assessment 4 days ago. I am now 4 days post-op on the second (dominant) eye. The pupil went down two days ago, but my vision through it is very blurry. I am due at follow-up in 3 days. I am using all eye drops prescribed as indicated. What at is the cause of the blurryness in the second eye please?"
Cataract,Cataracts - op to be done for close work or distance - advice please.,"I need my cataracts done and I'm very scared! I'm extremely nervous about the op itself and also about the outcome and making a wrong decision: For various health reasons and being in a lot of pain I'm not out and about very much and when I'm at home I use my iPhone and iPad a lot when I'm sitting down. if I have my eyes done for distance which is what the majority of people have, I would have to use glasses every time I want to send and receive a text message, look on Facebook, use the iPad, look something up etc. - and because of this I've been advised to have them done one close and one close--and-a-bit. I'm also concerned that if they are done for distance I won't be able to see properly to do my make-up, particularly eye-make-up, which is important to me. I will be quite happy to wear glasses for driving, TV, cinema and theatre, which is what I do now. If any ladies have had their eyes done for close vision rather than distance, can you tell me can you see ok to use your iPhone and do your eye make-up? Equally, any ladies who have had their eyes done for distance vision, how do you find it for using iPhone, seeing texts, and doing eye make-up? Apparently make-up glasses are a huge nuisance and not terribly successful. Any advice from either a patient or a professional would be most welcome. Thank you very much. "
Cataract,Residual complications - blur or smudge spots + light levels,"I've recently had cataract surgery done on each eye (the left one 12 weeks ago and the right one 8 weeks ago). I was very nearsighted, especially in the right eye, prior to surgery and also have a significant level of astigmatism in each eye. The surgeon installed standard monofocal lenses so I knew that I'd still need glasses prescribed after surgery. (Until last week when I finally got glasses from an optician, I went without glasses for several months.) My left eye surgery went OK but my right eye has been dispiriting. For weeks, healing was excruciatingly slow and I thought that there was perhaps a surgical problem and worried myself to the point of despair (""wrong lens or its dislocation""?, ""injured eye""?, ""why me""?, etc). Symptoms in my right eye included such things as minor ""crinkly"" areas in my field of vision (similar to seeing partially distorted letters when reading something through a piece of saran wrap); varying yet constant blur or smudge spots in my field of vision; a noticeably higher level of brightness when looking at TV with only my right eye (similar to brightness and/or contrast controls on a TV or computer monitor being turned up much too high); a very noticeably darker, shadowy light level in a darkened room at night (in my right eye compared to my left eye); a very high level of ""out of focus"" near vision in my right eye (exact opposite of the near-sightedness that I had in that eye before surgery) . I've been back to the ophthalmologist 4 times and he's run various tests including looking for PCO haze and closely examining the optic nerve with special equipment. He says everything checks out OK. Now that I have my glasses with progressive lenses, I can focus clearly, near and distant -- although intermediate focus by the right eye (e.g., at a computer screen) is much less than in the left eye. However, there still persists a certain amount of the symptoms associated with a varying smudge spot in my right eye field of vision and with the issues of brightness and the night-time shadowy, darker vision in that eye. I am now wondering if these symptoms are a result of a significant floater problem resulting from the surgery? However, the doctor said nothing about that. Alternatively, is it possible that my right eye is still ""healing"" from surgery after more than 2 months? If so, what does that mean? Are my right eye's varying smudge issue and the brightness/darkness issues something that will just go away on their own over time?"
Cataract,Cataract Surgery Complication - Need Advice,"Like many of you, I am frustrated with my recent experience post cataract surgery. Surgery day itself was very complicated. I had a capsular rapture that cause the Dr. to insert some Gel to hold the IOL in place. My eye pressure was fairly high all day as a result (around 40) but stabilized below 20 after about 4-5 hours. The next day my vision was 20/25. 5 days later i was at 20/20 and 10 days later i was at 20/20. Everything seemed to be going great and i loved my vision. Then suddenly, i woke up the morning of the 11th day and saw my vision was worse. Over the next several days my eye was sore and my vision was not imporving. When i saw my Dr. he thought everything should stabilize. When tested, over the next few weeks i tested at 20/60, 20/80, 20/40, 20/50. Basically all over the place. Then over the course of a month, it seemed that vision began to improve. I got to 20/30 when suddently about 2 months post surgery the exact same thing happend and i woke up with grey, grainy vission. Right back to 20/80.When the DR. examines me they say it could be a fold in the back of my eye. It could be vitrious, it could be nerve damage, it could be the lense. Nothing concrete that can answer the questions i have.From a symtom standpoing, i tell them that it is not the blurriness that is causing the visual issues but the depth of vision. I can see everything but it is faint. Not enough light is coming in. The vision appears at times like i am looking through a dirty glass window, it is pixelated. Objects are easier to see than letters/numbers.If anyone had or is having a similar experience, i would love to better understand what this could be. "
Cataract,Just had cateract surgery vision much more cloudy than before surgery! :( ,I've got complicated eyes and had an initial cateract surgery but the iol that was inserted was the wrong perscription so after doing some vision tests they took me back ibto surgery and removed the iol and replaced it with a different strength lens. My concern is that ny vision is now way more cloudy than vefore the first cateract surger ! im told that the cloudibnss will disipate over a week but im still rather sceptical and very worried.has anyone else had this right after their surgery?
Cataract,Accomodatibg iol's,"I am faced with decision of both distance, one distance one intermediate, one fiance and one near or accomodating iols. Been near sighted all my life. Can't imagine not being able to see anything close without glasses. Am writing this on my smart phone. Couldn't possibly do that with both distance for example. I heard accomodating lenses see both distance and some intermediate but that it doesn't work as well as described. Multi focal is out because glasses,won't correct for lack of contrast and low light vision and halos. Anyone out there know anything about accomodating lenses?"
Cataract,ERM surgery (Membrane removal),"This was following cataract removal. I had a cataract removed from my right eye in February which left me less sighted than before. I had one lens changed in my glasses because the doctor who did the operation thought it might help although the optician wasn't sure. In any case, I decided to have the right eye put right (ERM otherwise known as a membrane peel) before proceeding with cataract removal on the other eye. This operation was apparently successful and apart from the fact my eye is very bloodshot, I feel fine. Only thing is I can see a round black circle(like a plate) surrounded by red which 'quivers' whether I have my eyes open or closed. Has anyone else experienced this and does it go?"
Cataract,question re colors,"called a computer tec. because noticed the lights on modem were yellow -- before cataract surgery they were green -- tec says no, they are still green.I know you don't see colors correctly before surgery - but why am I seeing them wrong after?"
Cataract,Multifocal vs Monofocal Near vs Far Laser vs Conventional,"I am told I need to get cataract surgery on both my eyes,. My left has a fairly dense nuclear cataract and my right eye not as bad. I have the following decisions to make and I would love to hear from anyone who has gone thru what i am about to go thru who can help me with my decision and lessen my anxiety.1. I am told I could wait if it is not interfering with my quality of life, but that if I wait too long, the longer I wait the harder the cataract will become and if it becomes too hard and/or brittle, it could make the procedure more difficult and hence more risky.2. I am near sighted., I wear progressive glasses. Nothing is sharp anymore because of my cataracts, even with glasses but I can see my computer and my smartphone without glasses. If I go with monofocal, which one? Distance, intermediate or near? Anyone who had this surgery and chose one or the other, would love to hear how you are dealing with being able to see only one out of those 3 choices and whether you are happy with your decision..3. Multi focal vs Mono focal: I am told multi focal has not been perfected yet and there is a loss of contrast you don't have with mono focal. Also there is a problem with glare and/or halos. Some people are so unhappy with multi focal that they have another operatnion to switch to monofocal. Would love to be able to see at all distances but want to know what people think who have gotten the multi focal. Also there is a new multi focal for the past few years called TRI focal instead of BI focal. Supposed to let you see at intermediate which the bi focals did not do. 4. Most people say laser is better but I have a doctor from bascom palmer who is telling me that she is more comfortable with conventional and that she gets better results with conventional. Yeah but what about scarring, healing, no stitches, less energy required to break up the cataract and less stress on the eye that I heard about benefits of laser.5., Anestheisa: I am VERY squeamish about anything touching my eye. I cannot imagine a blade or even a laser, cutting into my eye. One doctor wants to put my eye totally to sleep so I won't be able to see for hours after my operation. wow, that's scary. want to ask about what the procedure is like, what you see and what you feel.Thanks guys.. Any help would be greatly appreciated. "
Cataract,CORTISONE PUFFERS & CATARACTS,"I'm booked in for surgery on my right eye cataract in about a month's time and was told by the surgeon that it's a classic cortisone caused fast accelerating cataract. I asked my pulmonary practice nurse about cortisone & cataracts a while ago and she said the amount which gets into the rest of the body via the lungs is too small to cause cataracts: I've now let her know that the surgeon says differently and also said that she often sees this.I'm wondering how many other people on coritsone puffers for COPD have been lulled into a false sense of security about this? I should say I would still have used the puffer because prior to it being prescribed I was coughing almost contiually and to quote one doctor: ""Most of us are going to get cataracts anyway if we live long enough.""I'm wondering what other people's experience has been in relation to this connecdtion? I posted similarly on the COPD forum and no-one there seemed to be aware of it."
Cataract,Post Op Question,Hello I'm Keith. Male 58. I've just had a cataract op on my left eye with a lens inserted as part of the procedure. this was only a week ago and the difference is remarkable. My pre op vision was very much reduced and now I can see a lot better. I'm following instructions on not lifting / bending etc and using drops as told. The vision in each eye individual is fine and even on computer when I still wear my specs. However my vision from both eyes at distance is difficult to describe. Maakes me feel a little dizzy and I suppose the best way to describe it would be how you could expect to see if you had just had a bump on the head. Just kind of offset and wobbly if that makes sense. I can see quite clearly apart from that. Has any one else experienced this and will it settle. It's still early days I know. Would be obliged to hear. Thanks 
Cataract,Cataracts,"i had cataract surgery in both eyes about one month ago.My vision is different, not better. I can see close, but everything ten feet or more is blurry. Driving is difficult. The TV is blurry....From experience , can my vision get better with time or is this as good as it's going to get? "
Cataract,Had My Cataract Op!!!,"Well, I finally had my cataract operation done yesterday. I was expecting awful things to happen during and afterwards, but the operation was painless and at the moment I can see distances nicely with my existing glasses, and I can see close-up clearly. The eye is not inflamed or red or painful, although it is still dilated so maybe the side-effects will start when it gets back to the normal size."
Cataract,Allergic to eye drops ?,Hi I'm hoping someone might be able to give me some advice. I had a cataract operation 2 days ago in my right eye ( I have glaucoma and cataracts in both ) so I know it's early days. I just wondered if anybody has been on maxitrol and prednisolene eye drops after surgery. I don't know if it's just coincidence ( or bad luck) but the right eye is streaming every time I use drops especially prednisolene which stings like hell and the right side of my nose is streaming too. I'm constantly blowing it (which I'm sure can't be helping my eye) . I just can't decide if it's a cold and came on as soon as I had the cataract op or if I'm allergic to the drops. Would be thankful for any advice.
Cataract,Mrs J Wordsworth,"I learned a couple of years ago that I had a developing cataract.I was told today I could go on the waiting list fo its removal if I wished to, or, I could wait a while as my sight is not too bad at the moment. It was suggested that a new pair of spectacles might help in the meantime. I am a bit concerned about the op.mostly as I am worried I'll feel claustrophobic when being 'held down'. can anyone reassure me? I feel a bit stupid about this worry I have. I am usually fairly resilient. J"
Cataract,Trulign toric lens does not seems to change focus,"Crystalens Trulign Toric lens replaced cataract lens in left eye 3 weeks back. Right dominant eye was done 2 weeks back. Right eye set for distance and the left biased for closer vision. My main concern is the left lens does not appear to accomodate much at all. It will focus ok at 1 foot but is terrible at 8. It functions more like a single focus lens. At the 1 week follow up the doc seemed unconcerned, but even though it was biased for closer focus than the right, I thought this lens should have a wider range of focus. Is this normal? Also the intermediate (across the room) vision is not good and I'm wondering if the limited focus range of the left lens has left a gap in what can be accomplished with the two lenses."
Cataract,Clock for second op ticks very slowly,"I had my left eye done on 16 February and a follow up with a nurse a month later. I had heard from friends, who went to the same hospital, that the op on the other eye would be only 6-12 weeks after the first. Having heard not a peep, despite getting a similar impression at the nurse consultation, I phoned up in case I had been mis-filed, only to be told that the 18 week clock was reset from the nurse consultation. That meant my second op could be as late as mid-July.Really surprised, as for for six months I'd not wearing correct glasses, especially as that is pointed up as a difficult time;in my case for my hobby of choral singing that requires good sight for small print.IMO op was good, but NHS beaurocracy lacks sense."
Cataract,Post cataract surgery symptoms,A little over two weeks ago I had cataract surgery and a multifocal lens inserted. Right after the surgery things were great. But over the past four days I have awakened in the morning with fogginess in my operated eye. After about 3-4 hours it clears. Has anyone else experienced this?
Cataract,Retrobulbar block (numbing the eye with a needle injection),"I've scheduled cataract surgery in September, but now the surgeon is saying he has called for an anesthesia called retrobulbar block, which is numbing the eye with a needle inserted into the optic nerve. He said it's because my cataract is dense (3) and my eyes don't dilate wide enough (5 1/2). This sounds very scary to me and I don't like the risk factors...damage to the eye muscles, blood clot, retinal detachment, and total blindness! Has anyone had this type of anesthesia for cataract surgery?? Do I really have to have it?"
Cataract,Problems with glare after cataract operations.,"I have problems with glare in mild sunlight. Then when returninginto the house everything is dark and it takes some time for m,y eyes to adjust. I wear dark sun glasses in sunlight and this helps. Can I get a filter for my distance glasses?"
Cataract,Shadow after operation which was 8 months ago now,"The cataract op went well and my sight is very good again. However I have a shadow that seems to be on the left of my left eye. No surgeon can see it and I am told it should disappear but normally that happens within 3 months, I am told. It seems to be there even if I cover my right eye up! I gather this is because I am seeing the lens, or its edge, but is not common. Has anyone had anything like it and did it disappear? Does this happen gradually or all of a sudden? Thanks for any comments as it does get very irritating, especially when driving or walking outside."
Cataract,3 years after cataract surgery,"I had my cataracts removed 3 years ago, then later I had to have lazer treatment for blurring - all successful [u]according to the surgeon[/u]!I was promised my vision would be perfect and that I would be able to throw away my glasses (I was myopic but could read) however I have been left needing glasses for both distance and close work, and very dry eyes. I use eyedrops almost every 2 hours and my eyes still feel sore and irritated. Bright sunshine and car headlights are also a problem. I can't enjoy days out or going on holiday, I have had to stop attending hydrotherapy for arthritis because of the clorine (even when wearing goggles). Life is not worth living.I am fed up and depressed, I cannot read for more than 10 minutes or so, and I wear sun glasses when using the computer - so I don't use it much any more. It has totally ruined my enjoyment of life, the experts insist the ops were 100% successful and expertly carried out and thats its very common to have dry eyes afterwards, - just to carry on using the eye drops - thank you, goodbye.Is there nothing I can do, is this for the rest of ly life? I am so depressed I can't wait to die."
Cataract,"After Cataract surgery, removing a dot?","Hello,It's been almost a year so I think i'm very very late to ask this but i'm starting to worry about this. I'm noticing my vision getting a little worse on my right eye.I had my left eye surgery for cataract first and one day after the surgery, I met my surgeon/doctor to check if it was fine and I remember him removing a ''dot'' with a needle. It was inside the clinic/hospital room, it wasn't something to be scared of or something dangerous. He gave me an antobiotic drop for a few days after that. However, for my right eye, I do not remember having doing that removing thing after the surgery. I'm really not sure what is this ''dot''. I'm just a bit paranoid about it since I really don't remember about it.My optometrist also said that my vision might get blurried a little after a while but all I have to do is go to a hospital to ''clean'' it or something.I plan to go to the hospital to have a check up about all this however i'm in college and it's very complicated to get a right time for an appointement. It would be great if I could stop worrying about this or if know if I have to go ASAP and see my doctor.*Side note: I'm apparently one of the rare cases of a young 18 years old patient with cataract without a physical accident like in a sport.-Peter Tran, a young student very anxious about this."
Cataract,Newly diagnosed with cataract,"I was diagnosed with the start of cataract in both eyes, with the right one more advanced but still mild adn the left one hardly there. I'm seeing the eye people again later today to pick up my new glasses and discuss options with them re the right eye cataract and also for them toi check that a detached retina has healed itself, which I'm sure it has bc no symptoms for weeks now.I'm concerned that I keep hearing ""they"" won't operate on cataracts until they're really bad, although this doesn't seem to apply to people with private health cover (in Australia).What do people do in the meantime in this situation? I live alone & fairly isolated and can't socialise at night any more without other people's help, bc oncoming headlights blind me. I've had two falls on steps & stairs because my hand missed the right hand railing and I'm continually dropping, breaking and spilling things.lI'm also VERY concerned that if this isn't fixed by next summer I won't be able to see to drive out of town in a bushfire situation, which is fairly common where I live and I can't stay in smoky conditions because I also have COPD.I guess what I need to know is the delay in operating a medical issue or a financial one? If the latter I will kick up a HUGE fuss! Australia is supposed to be a ""classless society"" but guess what, not always when it comes to medical treatmentF!"
Cataract,Which type of cataract surgery is the best?,"My mother needs cataract surgery, and I am still worried that the operation carried a one-in-1,000 risk of severe and permanent sight loss. I've read about the femtosecond laser cataract surgery. It seems more expensive, but is it the best option now? Pls advise. My sincere thanks,"
Cataract,Cateract and Tamsulosin,I have a mild cateract in one eye.The consultant had said he can carry out surgery to improve vision in this eye but the surgery is more complicated and carries an increased risk because I take Tamsulosin to treat an enlarged prostrate.He has left the decision to me.Does anyone have an experience of this. I am 75 and in decent health at present.
Cataract,Shadow across eye when I look to the left,Had lens replaced on Monday today long vision seems less and shadow across edge of vision when I look to the left anyone had similar ?
Cataract,cataract glasses,"My mom is 89 and had cataract surgery in the late 1950's when it was new. She's now bedridden with 24/7 care. But twice now, in removing her contacts, her eye was scratched and became infected so she couldn't wear her contacts and had to resort to those horrendous thick coke bottle-like glasses that distort everything in the world. She is deaf, and now with this problem, she is feeling hopeless. My question is: does anyone know where (or if) I can possibly find some more up to date glasses that are not so thick and awful as these ancient ones. My mom is a celebrated nature artist (google Dot Barlowe) and was still painting up until these incidents. i know you can imagine how frustrating this is. I wish I could get some leads out here in Ohio, but no one knows anything about this since implants are the current trend. If anyone out there can help us, we'd be so very grateful. Many thanks in advance!"
Cataract,Driving?,"Hiya all.I am to have a cataract op next Thursday (30th), and wonder how soon I will be allowed to drive again. Also, how soon does your eyesight in the operated-on eye settle down? I wear glasses and I guess I will have to have the operated eye's spectacle lens changed at some point."
Cataract,Sensitivity returned,I had cataract surgery on my left eye 6 days ago. At first I was sensitive to daylight and bright screens but that wore off by the third day but has now returned. On day 3 I had no pain but my eye feels a bit sensitive now. I use Pred Forte and Chloramphenicol drops twice daily. Before the surgery I used Systane eye drops for dry eyes and am wondering if it is safe to use these now just after surgery. They may make my eye feel more comfortable. Has anyone used dry eye drops post surgery and did it make a difference?
Cataract,Having A Cataract Op on the 17th July,"Hi EveryoneJust got my Hysterectomy sorted out, now going to sort out the eyes! Can anyone tell me how soon after having the op I can use eye makeup again please? "

Cataract,staying myopic by choice after cataract operations,"I have been 2-3 dioptres myopic all my life. When I had the cataract operation I asked the surgeon if I could stay myopic but he advised against it. Now the operations are over and my long distance sight is good, i still think it would have been more convenient for me to have continued to be about 2 dioptres myopic, then only needing glasses for distance and being able to lift them up or take them off to read or use the computer. My optometrist agrees with me, but unfortunately I did not see her before the operations. Does any one know, or understand, why surgeons resist the requests of moderately myopic clients (quite common according to my optometrist) to remain moderately myopic?"
Cataract,cataract operation with pseudoexfoliation syndrome,Has anyone had this operation with pseudoexfoliation in the London area and was it successful. What were any difficulties involved. Am due to have this procedure.
Cataract,Central Macular Edema after cataract surgery I had 1 month ago,"After 2 weeks from the surgery I developed Central Macular Edema, it manifested itself as a round gray spot on my field of vision and could not read also with the glasses because everything was blurred also because my right eye has still the cataract. The ophthalmologist prescribed me Acular to take together with M for another 2 months and asked me to go back for check up at the beginning of April. I was forgetting: last year I was found to have a slight macular degeneration, the dry type and she said not to worry. I would like to know from other people who had the same problem as mine. Is it likely that after 2 months I could be clear of it? Also anyone can tell me how long they have to wait before taking a flight abroad? I am asking this because I got some contradictory info from a number of doctors and feel confused."
Cataract,new member cataract,"hi i have been on sterioids whih has caused a cataract, has anyone else experienced this as im scared of surgery but vision is very blurred in one eye - thank you for listening "
Cataract,Family member with cataract and mental health problems,"A family member needs a cataract op on 1 eye only, she also has severe mental health problems. She insists that she cannot lie flat at all for any length of time whatsoever. Does anyone know if she can have her headraised (even slightly) or how long you actually have to lay flat? Any info much appreciated, thanks."
Cataract,See hazy after cataract surgery,I had my cataract surgery done in left eye 4 weeks ago. So far I see hazy and too bright from that eye. I still have some discomfort in this eye. I am using drops as prescribed by the doctor. Is that normal or I should worry about it? Is because the eye has not heeled completely yet and that is why I see hazy? I don't want to get the second eye done till I am satisfied with this eye. 
Cataract,Waiting time for cataracts,"My husband who will be 71 in April got cataracts on both eyes.Left eye partially blind.Been refered to hospital,already waited 2 months.Phoned hospital today to be told he wont be seen for another 9 months.Thats before he even sees a doctor.His eyesight deteriated more in last month.He can not read,do crosswords,play snooker or watch tv.Eyes are blured and he says he sees double at times.Surely this waiting is not right.He will be totally blind in a month or so "
Cataract,CATARACT OPERATION,"I have had both eyes done. I have to say there is absolutely nothing to be concerned about during these operations. I left my home at 2pm, got to the clinic by 2.30. I had opted for no injected anaesthetic but instead had anaesthetic drops put into the eye. Those lasted for about 20 mins with up to about 5 drops over that time. I was then taken through to the theatre. I spoke and joked throughout - which the opthalmalogist recognized as a nervous reaction - and it was! I was back home by 4.30 after tea and sandwhich had been offered by the clinic! Nice gesture. Next morning the patch was removed from my eye and I could even drive myself home! If anybody needs a cataract operation please do not worry as it is really an almost pleasant experience. A check up in 7 days then another one a month later and the whole thing was finished. "
Cataract,HOW LONG TILL MY VISION CLEARS,Hi left cataract removed 5 days ago although my vision has improved can see very clearly with my glasses on even tho husband has removed the lens for my left eye. i am finding if i cover my right eye i appear to havea bit of a blur over my pupil in my left eye is this normal- am i expecting too much too soon
Cataract,Where is best?,I am very lucky in that I have the option to go to either Albyn Private Hospital in Aberdeen ( thanks to my wiffes company healthcare) or Royal Jubilee ( as a referred NHS patient).Albyn is closer but I dont know if I would be better going to Glasgow as it has a good reputation ( from what I have heard) Im relatively young ( 53) for the op and have a lot of working years still to come unfortunately so I'm trying to decide which one I think would give me the best care.Does anyone have an opinion on these two hospitals that will help me decide?
Cataract,Vertigo and dizzy after cataract surgery ,I had my second cataract surgery three days ago. I was born with poor vision. Now at 66 I can see without glasses for the first time in my life.i am wondering how many others have experienced vertigo like symptoms. Is this the brain struggling with my new sight? Does this take time to adjust?id welcome your comments. By the way I am in Australia.
Cataract,Cataract vision,"Hi i was diagnosed with cataracts about a year ago and had surgery in my left eye last week, i have noticed that my vision is not as good as it was the days after my surgery, i was amazed how good my vision for distance was but slowly it has got slightly worse, its still good but not as good as the days after.Im just wondering if this is normal or due to the eye drops im using."
Cataract,Uveitis and cataracts,I have had uveitis for 8 years bilateral and both anterior and posterior with frequent flare ups. The longest I have ever been between flare ups is 12 months despite taking 5g prednisolone daily. In addition I have had macular aneurysm and loss of colour vision in my left eye and macular oedema in my right eye. I have at times also had raised intraoculr pressure.i have now been told I have cataracts in both eyes and the one in the left eye is ready for operating on. However I have also been told that cataracts are more complicated in people with uveitis especially for people like me who have recurrent uveitis. Is there anyone out there who has recurrent uveitis and has also had a cataract operation. Was it helpful? Any particular problems. Anything I need to be aware of?
Cataract,Cataract operaion ,"I had cataract operation 6 weeks ago but have been told that I am now shortsighted in that eye ---but longsighted in the good eye----this has caused a inbalance, resulting in sight not too good and bad headaches.Has anyone had this problem?"
Cataract,Cataract operation,Hi I have been to the hospital and they told me I could have the operation if I wish or leave it to see if it get worse. I am 65 years old and am disabled and use a wheelchair all the time and have many health problems which afects my confidence in a big way. My questen is can I have a full anesthetic in Hospital to have the operation? That way I might be brave enough to have done. 
Cataract,Feeling of something in eye after cataract surgery,"Has anyone had this problem. It has been 2 months since surgery in right eye. Dr checked eye a few times an states hefinds nothing in my eye, but my vision is perfect. This feeling is driving me crazy. He prescribed restatis and Sustained drops, so far it feels the same. He said I have slight dry eyes and now he said he doesn't know what is wrong."
Cataract,cataract surgeons,"I would like to find a top Eye Cataract Specialist for a 2nd opinion. Would appreciate any info on that .,I had cataract surgery beginning of June. My eye has been uncomfortable ever since. I have been back to see the surgeon twice and the scans (he says) show my eye is ok It was done at the Southampton General Eye Clinic.however, it is always watering, and the wind is now having a dramatic effect on it. I have bought some 'wrap around' sunglasses from M&S, because I just could not find any in the opticians that came around the sides tight enough. My eye is often aching. I have been give HYLO lubricating drops which help, but now the weather is getting cooler, I just cannot stay outside at all. I seem to always have a pain on the outer side of my eye, and the vision on that very outer corner can go blurry. but on the whole my vision is vastly improved. Does anyone have similar problems. More importanly could someone tell me names of the top Eye Specialist in this field. I will go private, and have to get this sorted whatever it costs. "
Cataract,Cataract Removal - Small Pupil Complication,"I had the operation today and everyone knew someone who'd had it done and said it was a doddle, didn't feel a thing, in and out in a short time etc. so although I was a bit nervous I wasn't unduly worried.I had several lots of eyedrops administered to dilate pupil. The surgeon said that I had a small cataract in my other eye too and I could have that done in the future. I was delighted because some people are able to discard their specs if they have both done. He also said that my pupil was still quite small and he may have to use clamps to widen it. Was wheeled into theatre and anaesthetic drops applied. Was dreading the first cut but wasn't even sure when they'd started so I was quite fine. After some time though I heard the surgeon call for the clamps. From then on it was a living hell.I felt stabbing pain and he called for lignocane (sp) and then it felt like someone was sticking pins all round my eyeball. (I think they were injecting anaesthetic into my eyeball) I was really tense and stressed. I just wanted it to be over. More poking and prodding and the surgeon said just relax, you're doing fine only about another 10 minutes!!I think I was in surgery for about 40 minutes whereas others had come and gone much quicker while I was waiting for my turn.When I was finally wheeled out (with iodine streaks in my light blonde hair - why don't they put a cap on you before they slosh that all over your eye?) I think I was in shock. I was shivering cold and trembling but I was just urged to sit up and walk to a chair where I was given a cup of tea.I've searched the internet for more information about this and lots of sites say the patient should be given some sort of sedative or mild anaesthesia.There are also lots of warnings about the increased risks with this sort of cataract surgery. I was just told that there was a slightly increased risk.Well I'm sitting here with my patch on and now dreading having the other one done unless I can have a general anaesthetic which was never offered to me at any time. Strange that because my friend was offered a general anaesthetic for a camera down the throat (gastroscopy). I'd have any amount of those compared to what I had.I feel a bit of a \""wuss\"" cos everyone else says it was \""nothing\"".Be interested to hear from anyone else who thought it was a horrible experience and painful? Otherwise I'll have to admit I'm just a cry baby.[img][/img]"
Cataract,has anyone experienced strange sensation ,"i have had a cateract op but didnt have a cateract i had a multi focal lense in my right eye to get rid of my glasses foolishly .and there was a problem so i had to have the lense taken out and replaced with a momo focal , which gave me back my old sight back it has been a very traumatic .but the drops i had to put in wher pred forte to start with ,and they gave me a horrible dead sensation with a strange pain and tightening in my head above my eye ,almost like it had had effected my brain anyone else had anything like this ?"
Cataract,Vision deterioration after cataract surgery,I knew I'd need reading glasses but my surgeon was clear that he was putting in a 'distance' lens. My distance vision was fantastic a couple of days after the surgery but has been deteriorating since. Is this normal? I had a battery of tests at the eye hospital yesterday and there's apparently nothing wrong - but the doctor said he had no explanation. He could only say it takes a while for the vision to settle down. I'm terrified that my vision continues to deteriorate.

Cataract,"Starting cataracts at 56, very frightened...help?",I have just been told I am starting cataracts at 55. This seems young and I have no diabetes or trauma to explain it. I feel very frightened. Many posts on here are negative about the surgery. Does anyone have any more comforting experiences? I've never heard of cataracts in anyone under 70.
