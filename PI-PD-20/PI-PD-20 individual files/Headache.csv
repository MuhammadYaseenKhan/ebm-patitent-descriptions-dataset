Headache,"Spaced out, high, Drunk Feeling. Please help me. (5 MONTHS) ","Hi everyone.My name is Erik. I am a 20 year old male, thin build. 6' 2'' at 170 lbs. I have had really debilitating issues for the last 5 months. The issue is that I feel drunk, spacey, loopy, high and dizzy all the time. It basically feels the same as if you were tipsy or the high feeling you can get. I also have visual disturbances. My vision has become blurry and I have somewhat tunnel vision. I just feel all around out of it. I find myself daydream, when I say this I mean my eyes don't focus on anything (go blurry) and just look at nothing. I think it might be slight double vision. Sounds are also very werid and it takes alot of energy to focus on visual and audio stimulants. Additionally, I am tired all the time. Extremely tired. Some days I will sleep very well for 10-11 hours and still be tired when I wake up and exercise will not wake me up. It is like the type of good solid sleep you have when your body is sick.. My memory has gotten really bad as well as my ability to process thoughts and engage in conversation. Imagine being drunk all the time...first I have been reading on boards like this for a long time now and have seen some people with these symptoms but no answers!! People seem to disappear. I hope hey have solved this problem but please let me know how!Let me start by giving some background information. In August 2015 I was in an indoor rock climbing gym and fell from 15 feet straight onto my back. I could not move for a good 15 minutes because it hurt so bad. I wasn't able to do anything athletic after that day for at least a month. However, I did not have my current symptoms after this fall. Fast forward to December 15th 2015. I got really sick, was in bed for 4 days. Sore throat, eyes hurt like crazy, and super tired. It was during and after these 4 days that I developed a headache. This headache causes a pressure/dull/sharp pain behind my eyes, the upper bridge of my nose and right in between my eyes on my forehead. This headache lasted for about 4 months. At about 3 weeks into the headache I went and saw an ENT as I thought it was a sinus infection. i took multiple sets of antibiotics over the course of the next month to no avail. I got blood tests and liver test at around 2 months into the headache and nothing showed abnormal. I then was able to get into a nuerologist. They were unable to find anything after taking an MRI of my head with a barium contrast. Since the beginning of my headache I have been seeing a (PT) physical therapist mostly for my neck and back since after the fall my back is sore constantly. I had a neck injury about 5 years ago on a trampoline so I have a sore neck, tight muscles alot from that. At about 3 months into the headache (3/15/2015) I developed a new symptom, the drunk/high, dizziness, loopiness. I had the headache at the same time at this point. My PT suggested that I may have a blood vessel being pinched in my neck or a nerve being pinched in my mid back area where my rock climbing fall pain is mostly at.I have been to 3 different chiropractors since this has occured about 5 times to each one. It has not helped so far. My PT gave me massages in my affected back and neck areas. Also a new thing I've noticed recently is that when I look up (bend my neck to look at the sky) I seem to get some sort of relief? Also ever since the loopy part started (this did not happen when I just had the headache) any amount of alcohol at all will make me SUPER DRUNK, literally like 2 sips. I used to be able to drink 3 full beers before getting buzzed.I am thinking I want my doctor to give me a full head (brain/upper atlas) to lower back (tailbone) MRI so that my nerves and blood vessels going to my brain can be evaluated. Do you think this is a good idea? Has anyone had these symptoms before? I am now 5 months into this and it is debilitating. No doctor is taking me seriously because I am so young and the chances of having a serious problem are supposedly slim because of my age. PLEASE HELP!!! I feel like I'm caught in a dream and losing my awareness and my IQ. I am afraid something is damaging my brain and this is going to be permanent."
Headache,"Head pressure, Brain fog, odd head sensation, feeling detached","Hi all, I decided to become a member and make a post here after reading the forums for quite a while, great site by the way. I am currently suffering with various symptoms and am in a bad way and just don't know where to turn any more so thought I would post here and see if anyone has any similar experiences or advice. So first of I am male and 26 years old. I have been suffering with the symptoms in the title pretty consistently for about 2 and a half years now. I used to have some relief from the symptoms for a day or 2 here and there or maybe a bit of relief for a few hours in the day but recently the symptoms are pretty much constant and I cannot shake them. I have an overall mild pressure feeling in the head, its not painful but is just very aggravating and feels really strange. I also have extreme brain fog with this and like a fuzzy head, there is a constant cloud over my brain and I never have any mental clarity or a clear head. My cognitive function is extremely poor now, my short term memory is non existent, its scarily bad. I often feel, detached from reality when the symptoms are bad and suffer from de-realisation, although I think this may be down to some anxiety and depression I experience when the symptoms run me down. I also get random sharp cramping pains in the head, they are quite painful but do not bother me so much as they only usually last a second or 2, it varies on how many I get of these each day but its usually less than 5. It often feels as though my brain is malfunctioning somehow and my cognitive function and senses are all out of whack, its hard to explain. There can sometimes be a build up of these symptoms throughout the day and by the night I can feel like I somehow how the flu without a fever? Like I have the head pressure, completely foggy headed, I feel super unwell, weak, sometimes even start feeling cold. Also have night sweats usually for about 4 or 5 days each month, there doesnt seem to be any sort of pattern to them that I can notice, so not sure if they are relevant. Another thing I have is ringing in ears which is mild but seems to have gotten worse recently if that sounds relevant at all. The main thing that gets me is the odd head pressure/sensation and the utterly life hindering brain fog, my brain feels like it is coated in a dark blanket constantly.I do suffer from anxiety, I know many of these symptoms can be caused or made worse by these symptoms. I dont doubt that anxiety is a contributing factor and the way I think about they symptoms probably makes them worse but I have come a long long way with my anxiety, I have good control over it, I haven't had a panic attack in a couple of years, I manage to control most of my concious anxiety and stay in a positive mindset. No doubt I still have some subconscious anxiety underlying and I am working on that but I am not convinced this is the route cause of my symptoms. I am in therapy for my anxiety. I do not feel I will ever fully recover while I have these symptoms hanging over me though. I have been to the doctor about these symptoms, although I do think I struggle to explain them or put them across very well in the doctors office. I have have blood tests which are all normal. I saw a neurologist couple of years back when this started, had a CT scan which was normal, they put the stabbing pains down to icepick headaches and thought the other symptoms were probably made worse by my anx/depression. Since then I went away and have been on anti depressants etc with no improvement of symptoms. I have also had a few ECGs and a 24hr ECG as I have slow heart rate and low bp so thought maybe the symptoms could be down to low bp and lack of blood to the brain, doctors do not think think this is the case and all my results came back normal. I have recently been back to the neurologist who is referring me for an MRI although he said he is sure there is nothing sinister and thinks the symptoms are probably tension type headaches and made worse by and previous drug use, he only put it down to the drug use when i told him about it though so it seemed like a convenient diagnosis. I forgot to mention I used to take drugs on the weekends socially, cocaine, ketamine and ecstasy on different occasions for a couple of years, I have had periods where I have felt ok since taking these drugs and do not really think they are the cause, I was not an addict this was just one or 2 nights a month at the weekends. So I have an MRI coming up but the neuro thinks it will be clear and obviously I hope it is and I am looking for other answers. What could be causing these symptoms? Other than anxiety which i no can be a factor, but I have periods where my anxiety is pretty much non existent but these symptoms still build up out of nowhere and persist. I was thinking maybe some sort of allergy could be a possibility, I have tried cutting out gluten and lactose, this didn't seem to make much difference although I didn't stick to this for very long. I actually did a juice fast for 2 weeks with eating nothing other than fruit and veg juice put through a juicer to see if that would help but it didn't really give me any relief. Are there any other stomach issues that could cause this? I never have diarrhoea or constipation, my stools always float recently though, to the point of not being able to flush them, also whenever I have seen chance medicine doctors they check me out and say they think i have issues with digestion, i don't feel i have these issues but do wonder if there might be something in it. Could there be something going on with the blood vessels in my head? Could it be a spine/posture issue? Some sort of epilepsy or electrical activity in my brain? I just have no idea now and am desperate for some relief. If anyone has any ideas or advice I would really appreciate it. Oh just to add I am reasonably fit, I try go to the gym a few times a week and I do some weight lifting. I am a normal weight. I have been losing some weight recently which is a concern but I am still in a normal weight range for height and age. Thanks for reading"
Headache,Clicking noise in throat/head when talking - can be heard externally ,"For the past 4 months I've been getting a clicking/popping noise, like popping candy, somewhere in the region of my head and neck. The noise happens very day for a few mins and only happens when I talk or swallow. The weirdest thing is the sound it makes can be heard externally, it is not just a noise that is heard internally in my head/neck. I have been feeling really hot while this happens, and mostly for the rest of the day, especially on the face. I have checked my temperature but I don't have one.When I went to the doctors 2 months ago, they discovered that a lymph node in neck neck (right hand side) was swollen slightly. It is still swollen and visibly throbs (like a pulse) but is painless.I get headaches quite a bit and feel very tired, I did however have very low B12 levels at the end of last year so it could be that again (I had to have injections to boost it).So, not sure if it is all connected but my main concern is the weird noise in my head/neck. I have been referred for an urgent MRI scan. I would really appreciate if anyone has any ideas of what this could be - thank you."
Headache,Some things on my phone are fine to do but at certain times other things don't work well for my head,"I've been dealing with some extreme anxiety issues for the past 2 and a half months now, and it's debilitating at this point. It's taken away almost everything I love to do. One thing that makes me think I may have some kind of brain issue though is that playing certain games on my phone is fine for me, they wont cause any kind of head issues, anxiety, or nausea. But at certain times like when I watch YouTube or other apps they cause all those previous issues. I don't know if it's my anxiety that causes my brain to go off or if there's something wrong. Main question is why can I do some things on my phone just fine (mostly one app) all the time but sometimes doing any other things on my phone will cause a bunch of issues. Do I have an eye problem? 99% sure I don't need glasses though. Thanks for any responses as they're really valued to me. ?"
Headache,Weird migraine+other symptoms for over 2 weeks now,"A few weeks ago i developed a head pain that was different than any migraine I have had before. It was a burning sensation that was mainly on the left side of my head and around my ear. It would be unbearable for hours at a time than just become a normal pressure headache. After a few days I called my doctor and took medication for an ear infection because I was unable to go into the doctors office due to Covid 19. The medication did absoutly nothing and my head pain still returns(but not as frequently) and i can sometimes hear a swishing/crackling noise in the back of my head (almost at my neck). I also have the feeling of tingling in the back of my head occationaly and also soreness in my head and neck. I also just wanna put out that have a history if having anxiety attacks so when I start to worry i can become dizzy, out if breath, and almost numb, so when i have those symptoms I usually ignore it due to my history with anxiety. Due to my concerns I started to look up my symptoms and the things that are coming up seem pretty scary (stroke, brain tumor, spinal leak, ect) So i thought I should ask on here and see if any of you guys have any idea. I currently cant go into the doctors office due to coronavirus so this seems to be the next best thing. Thank you and any input is appreciated."

Headache,Constant head pressure/head feels fatigued/Spaced out,"Back in December, I experienced the worst headache/migraine of my life. It was a feeling of undescribable head pressure(I describe it as fluid surrounding my head). Pressure/headache in the eyes was really terrible. When I thought I was feeling a bit better and got up to move around, the head pressure would return and I had to lay back down. This lasted 2-3 days. I thought I would recover, but I've never felt the same since... And I'm only 28. No prior health issues to this. I have a 5 year old daughter and to be honest, this is completely ruining my life. The head pressure has never gone away.The head pressure was so bad on and off for the first 4 months I literally thought I had brain swelling(that's how it made me feel). It felt as if someone was moving my brain around. It's as if your head is fatigued from working too hard and it's in a constant state of shaking. A very weird, undescribable, uncomfortable, scary feeling. I had really bad brain fog. I would have moments where I would space out so bad I felt as if I was in a dream for the majority of those months. So detached. I still have those moments.Everyday I wake up, I have head pressure(blood shot eyes). My ears feel the need to pop deep inside the cavity. Uncomfortable and unease feeling of my head(like it's fatigued) is the feeling that makes it the worst. My head feels clogged and I espcially feel it in the surrounding portion of my back eyes, ears and head. I don't ever feel normal. There might be a relief of head fatigue from time to time, but my head has never felt the same. The only thing that makes me feel somewhat normal is if I lay down. In the beginning 4 months, putting on hats, listening to loud music, over the ear headphones only made my head pressure worse and give me terrible headaches for the remaning day in the begining. Went to the ER twice the first few months for the head pressure symptoms and followed up with my primary care doctor. They all said stress but ultimately was referred to a neurologist, ENT & Eye Doctor to cover my basis. I've had an MRI of the brain with and without contrast done. Only thing that revealed was a few mucus cyst(which are normal I guess). I've had a panel of blood work ran which all came back normal. Checked for Thyroid function, blood count and few other things. Had a CT scan done of my sinus(no prior sinus or allergy issues in my life) and pending results on that. Not really optimistic it's going to show anything.I don't know what to do at this point. I truthfully feel hopeless.. I need help"

Headache,Headache,"Hello, I am 19 and been having headaches for the last week, every single day. When I was little used to suffer from migraines. But its all okay for last 3 years and this pain is not like a migraine. It is not as painful as migraine and I usually feel it on both sides of forehead and in the back of my head. Sometimes I feel it on both sides and it feels like someone is pressing my head there. It is small/medium pain that does not require painkillers took them only twice. I don’t see any other symptoms. I am not having nausea, I am not vomiting. I dont have problem with talking/walking and although my vision is blurry I am wearing glasses. So that is separate problem. Can anyone tell me, what to do with this and what can be causing this? The pain is more annoying than problematic. I dont have problems with light and sometimes only a loud sound is unpleasant but not as much as migraine. Any help will be much appreciated."
Headache,Headache on all antidepressants,I hope this is not a very long one for you to read so I will try as short as possible but I have some.I first was hit by anxiety and depression in 2008 -and was unmedicated for about 1 year and I have become an absolute wreck. I was completely unable to function let alone go to work or something! I was 23 at the time! I was in such a bad state that even going to the toilet seemed like a monumental thing!I first saw a psyc and he put me on prozac. Within about a week or 2 I started feeling alive and everything was so good I was thinking this was a miracle and I could not believe how well It made me feel. Back to normal full energy working and thriving!Tried to come off the meds a few times but everytime I did a became the same old wreck so I knew meds are for me for life.However I was not taking prozac regularly but since it has a half life i took it every 2-3 days or sometimes just once a week and it did not seem to cause me problems but then in 2017 I had a health issue or at least I thought I had cus this stupid dr scared me into thinking I have some form of cancer which later on I redid the colonoscopy and it proved to be nothing at all other than an intestinal reaction to painkiller I has taken prior!nonethless another pdoc put me on lexapro and it worked so well without any issue at all for about 6-7 months then I starter taking that too only every 2-3 days. Then I started to notice everyday I was taking the pill I had intense headaches about 30-60 min each time I took the pill. This lasted for a few months and the only thing that releived the pain was it I took a benzo. Xanax or Valium or something.Even to date I have tried many ADs and each time it was pretty much the same. They help my depression and make me go back to functioning but now with a headache every single time! And only thing which helps is taking a benzo!The doctors are baffled! They have no idea why could this be and my idea that I could have ruined something on neurotransmitters or something by not taking them regularly said was not correct and have asked so many psych docs and all have said the same! Yet nobody has been to identify the cause or find a solution.I have been searching for a solution and read so many articles and what not online for all this time and only found a lady who said that everytime she took lexapro after 30 min she had headaches that never resolved for 6 months and then when she switched to Venlafaxine they went away!So here I am now on Venlafaxine for 4 days on XL version same to that lady but the headaches are here for me still! Lets see what happens in the meantime but please it anyone has any idea I beg you to help!I forgot to add that I also have a sinus cyst on the right side of my maxillary sinus and I also had it before 10 years ago which I operated for. but the doctors do not think the headacheis because of it and I am also a bit sceptical because the pain is only when I take ADs!Thank you all
Headache,deep depression in head since childhood that has recently gotten worse?? freaking out,"hi there!! wasnt sure where else to put this but im kinda freaking out and i wasnt sure where else to go. its almost 2am EST and i didnt want to be silly and go to the ER for nothing, esp during this timemy name is kaitlyn and im 19, female.preface: ive had this deep dent (?) in the spot between my scalp and the crown of my head ever since i can remember. i actually used to make my friends touch it and freak them out when i was little and they were always grossed out but we would just laugh about it so i never really focused on it.so recently i was absently feeling my head for some reason and noticed a new dent/area of the existing dent?? i had my friend feel it but she said it was probably nothing and i was probably imagining it so i just ignored it.tonight the same thing happened, was absently just scratching my head or something and there was pain?? like i narrowed it down to a specific, small area/bump (i mean super small) but ever since ive been feeling it/trying to determine what this is it has spread?? like right now i feel the discomfort/pain in a vertical line going from the tiny bump through the dent in my head and fading somewhere in the dent. also while feeling this tiny bump i noticed the dent had grown more??? so now its my original, deepest dent + the recent much shallower one below it + an even shallower, barely noticeable dent below that + a vertical, line-like depression going from my original dent to the bump.right now i guess im freaking out because my legs are violently shaking, along with trembling everywhere else and a feeling of anxiety. i know i wont be able to sleep tonight. please help because this is really scaring me and i cant find anything on the internet that describes this, let alone describes my original situation.P.S. not sure if this matters but when i was 6 months old i had a hairline fracture in my skull"

Headache,Complicated Headaches - Long Post,"If this is against the rules, please let me know. I am here seeking advice about my headaches. I am here out of desperation. I’m not necessarily seeking a diagnosis for my issue but rather advice on where to go next, what questions to ask my physicians, etc.I am a 25-year-old male. I weigh 185 pounds. I have diagnoses of IBS with constipation, generalized anxiety disorder, and I am currently being evaluated by a sleep specialist for possible sleep apnea. I have dealt with headaches my entire life. My first MRI for headaches was after an accident in gymnastics where I hit my head in 2005. I had a CT in the ER, where they noticed a shadow, so the radiologist recommended an MRI. During this MRI, they noticed what they believed was a neuroepithelial cyst. This cyst is still present today and is slightly larger than it was previously.Fast forward to high school, I had another MRI due to recurrent headaches. During this time, bilateral maxillary sinus retention cysts were noted. I was treated for allergies with nasal steroids and these headaches went away.Fast forward to June, 2019. I started a new job where I had to park quite a way from my workspace. After arriving at work each day, I noticed I had a headache that would go away with a few minutes of inactivity and by cooling down. Eventually, however, these headaches became harder to abort. I ended up in the ER four times before I was hospitalized the first time, for what the neurologist called an intractable migraine. During my ER visits, I was given multiple doses of Toradol which provided no relief. I was also given Fioricet and given a lumbar puncture, which showed an elevated opening pressure of 29. I was started on Diamox by my ER physician for suspected IIH.During my first hospitalization, my neurologists claimed my ER physician performed the LP incorrectly, as it is not likely for a male of normal weight to have elevated pressure or to have IIH. The LP was never repeated during this stay. I was diagnosed with an intractable migraine due to my symptoms: A headache that caused the worse pain of my entire life, balance issues making it hard to walk, slurred speech, and double vision. I had no light or sound sensitivity. I was treated with the valproic acid/DHE protocol, and I was discharged in the same condition that I was admitted in. During this stay, I had a CTA/CTV of the head/neck, an MRI with/without contrast of the head/neck/face. Everything was normal except for the cyst, which everybody agreed was benign.I requested a second opinion and saw a neurologist at home. This neurologist agreed with the ER doctor and gave me a suspected diagnosis of IIH and increased my Diamox to 1,500mg/day. A repeat LP was ordered. About 2 months later, I had the repeat LP and had a normal opening pressure of 16. The neurologist said the Diamox was working and that was good. Due to my headaches worsening, the neurologist also started me on Depakote. I noticed no improvement with my symptoms.I sought a 3rd opinion at the biggest hospital in my state with their headache specialist. He basically said the ER doctor and my last neurologist were wrong and diagnosed me with a migraine disorder. He continued the Depakote and prescribed Aimovig.Two weeks later, I was hospitalized with a near inability to walk due to my headaches and dizziness. They continued the DHE/valproic acid protocol which provided no relief. I was also given an occipital nerve block just in case. After a few days, I had a new attending neurologist. He didn’t believe I had any symptoms of a migraine and started me on indomethacin, titrating me up to 250mg/day. This medication relieved my symptoms almost immediately, and I was diagnosed with with an indomethacin-responsive headache syndrome, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania. I was also diagnosed with primary exercise headaches.However, I still experience headaches on a daily basis. If I take less than 200mg/day of indomethacin, I have debilitating headaches that nearly justify hospitalization. My headaches are worsened by any amount of exertion. Even doing dishes and sweeping my floors will trigger an immense headache.Is there something my neurologists could be missing? Is there another medication I should ask about? What can treat the exertion aspect of the headaches? I will include a list of medications I am currently on, as well as a list of things I have tried for the headaches and their effectiveness.Currently Taking:Prazosin - 4mg/day for headachesVenlafaxine - 75mg/day for headaches/anxietyDoxepin - 10mg/day for sleep issuesIndomethacin - 200mg/day for headachesAcetaminophen - 2,000 to 4,000mg/day for headachesMiralax for constipationMedications I have Tried for HeadachesDepakote - No reliefAimovig - Six months so far and no reliefSumatriptan - Oral and injections - No relief and negative cardiac symptomsNasal and IM Dihydroergotamine - No relief and based on recommendation of cardiologist in ER, I should not take again due to negative cardiac symptomsTopiramate - No reliefPropranolol - No relief and negative side effectsAmitriptyline - No relief and negative side effectsDuloxetine - No relief"

Headache,Nerve pain on left hand side on bottom of head,For the last 5 weeks I've had a nerve pain on bottom left hand side of head. It feels like a clump of hair has been pulled out of my scalp. I spoke to doctor on phone and he said this could go on for months. Just take painkillers. Doing my own research I've come across occipital neuralgia. It seems to fit all of my symptons. I would love to hear from anyone who has suffered from this. I just know I can't put up with this for months on end.
Headache,Cervicogenic Headache ,"HiI am new here and hoping to talk to others who suffer like me. I have had chronic almost daily headaches for the past 6/7 years. I have been to my GP and was referred to a neurologist who mainly just tried to medicate me. I have had amitriptyline, propananol and topamax none of which eased the headaches but just gave me awful side effects. I was prescribed sumitriptan for pain relief and it's the only thing that relieves the headaches but I am becoming more and more reliant on them. I tried to help myself and after attending chiropractors and an osteopath who confirmed my neck muscles are really tight and I realised I always have a tender/sore neck I then connected this to my office job where I have spent years slumped over a desk.I then to my joy discovered a headache clinic here in Belfast where I live who specialise in headaches. I seen a therapist here who confirmed I suffer cervicogenic headaches which are coming from my neck she described the muscles in my neck as being like a rope they are so tight. The therapist performs manoeuvres on the neck vertebrae to loosen up and help. Unfortunately this treatment takes months to help and isn't cheap. I started off having 1/2 sessions a week but still don't have a big amount of relief. I am now in a situation where I can only afford one session once a month and this isn't enough to help. I am suffering badly at the minute I have had headaches every day for past week I feel my neck so stiff and tight. I have had to take sumitriptan every day which isn't good at all.I am so worried what to do now, who to turn to what next. I seem to have exhausted most things and feel I no longer have any quality of life as I am in constant pain and always exhausted. Does anyone else out there suffer these? And can offer any hope/ advice/help??I am really at the end of my tether.ThanksJoanne"
Headache,I had ocular migraine twice without otherwise experiencing migraines?,"Two years ago I had a ocular migraine for the first time. At least that's what I found out on google about my experience. What happened is I was stressed and suddenly I start seeing colors floating around on one side in my field of vision, even with my eyes closed I saw them. I completely freaked out as I thought something really bad had happened to my brain but in about 30 minutes it was over and I got an awful headache instead.Headaches I experience quite often in the last couple of years. I used to take painkillers for that several days a week but then I stopped doing that as it's obviously bad and i'm pretty sure it's just stress induced headaches. I have no symptoms of migraine.I got this ocular migraine again last year. I wasn't doing anything and wasn't stressed, I was just watching tv and suddenly I notice a blurry spot in my vision field triggered by bright colors like white mainly. It soon develops from a blurry spot to colors again floating around on one side in sort of a half-circle in my vision field but this time I handle it much better as I expect it to only last 30 minutes which it did and then I got a really bad a headache just like the time it happened a year before. I never consulted any doctor about this and i've sort of felt it's useless to do so this long after. I have however consulted doctors before about my headaches but only been told to keep taking painkillers, and that ""headaches are normal, deal with it"" pretty much so I haven't gotten any help from doing that. I wonder is it possible to get ocular migraines just like that and not actually suffer from migraine or is it possible to suffer from migraine without knowing?? I tried keeping a headache diary for a few weeks but I couldn't find any red thread in my notes in terms of possible triggers."
Headache,Persistent headache and nausea for 2.5 weeks straight!! What is it?,"2.5 weeks ago I developed a light, dull consistent headache that was on both sides of my head and occasionally would move to my lower forehead that was accompanied by double vision, clogged ears, slight pressure on the top of my nose, difficulty looking at computer screens and trouble sleeping. I spoke with a doctor who said i have a sinus infection and prescribed me augmentin for 7 days after advil, tylenol and mucinex had not helped me at all. After taking my 7 day dose of augmentin, i felt extremely better ( i was running, playing basketball and working out with very minor headache pain and no loss of physical strength or balance) and had virtually no vision or light sensitivity issues. 4 days after i was off of augmentin, my headache and nausea started to come back so i worried and my doctor prescribed me another 7 day dose of augmentin AND sumatriptan. I am on day two of augmentin again and i feel about 40% better but still have that light headache on both sides so i dont think the sumatriptan helped much and i think augmentin is helping quite a bit. however, i am not completely healed yet and im scared that if augmentin doesnt clear it up completely, that something more serious may be at risk. If anyone has experience with this, please let me know if this is common or not. I really am praying that its not something that could be a much larger issue. Any insight is appreciated!!"
Headache,Misaligned upperspine/neck with chronic 2 year heacahes,"Hi, about 2 years ago i had a injury in teh gym whilst doing shoulder press, i developed pain in my upper back on one side and i could barely roll out of bed/ move. i just thought it was a pulled muscle so went to gp and go some naproxen . about a month or 2 later i was assaulted and punched twice in the side of the head, had concussion but was not unconscious. then a month or so after that i started to develop severe headaches that felt like migraines/ i was having a stroke.i was told i had tension headaches, then migraines etc. 2 years down the line ive seen a neurologist who has almost certainly misdiagnosed me for having chronic migraines.id like to mention during the last 2 years i have suffered from chronic neck stiffness and burning/stabbing/aching in my left temple that worsen when i twist my head side to side.a month or two ago i realised my upper neck is completely out of wack and all the bumps on top of each vertebrae are out of line. i went to see a chiropractor who didint seem too concerned but defently said i have a curvature of the spine. from my symptoms i believe i have cervicogenic headachesi now think that the injurys have caused some sort of cervical issues and are causing my all these headaches and pain. its been a complete nightmare and doctors have been rubbish.i would really like an xray or mri to see really whats going on, from what i have said is it likely to be a nerve issues originating from my neck? i can post a picture of my upper spine as its clear the bones are not in line if that helps.im so stuck with this it causes me so much pain any advice would be much appreciated"
Headache,Pressure in head within nose cavity,"I have had this pressure that eminates from the sinus or cavities behind the nose for about 4 months now. It started gradually and now is a constant pressure that causes lightheadindness / dizziness and headaches. it gets worse when I move or do anything physical, especially when I move my head down. I know it is trapped air that is causing the problem, it's as if i have sinusitus and i'm on a plan. Popping my ears helps reduce the pressure for a few minutes but it tends to build back up again. 4 weeks ago whilst feeling particularly pressurised I popped my ears whilst yawning and pulling my left ear, what happened next doctors have a hard time believing. Loads of air came out of my left ear, as if like sticking a nail in a bike tire. This lasted for between 20-30 seconds. afterwards, I felt great, no head pressure, no headaches, no dizziness. I think this could well be a breakthrough for a lot of head pressure cases I read on the net. For that day I had my life back, sadly the next day it just seemed to build up again. The problem is that there doesn't seem to be much research out there on this and it is very hard to live with it. I would say its like a constant uncomfortableness and pain about 3/4 out of 10. When moving this increases and I have had some really bad 10 out of 10 headaches. i'm interested in other people who have experienced similar sympotoms and what the outcome was. This does seem curable, but ENTs don't seem to know anything about it. I'm positive this can get resolved in the future but its up to people who are suffering with this to get this condition out there and into public knowledge."
Headache,"Felt ""Pop"" in my head...haven't felt right sense","Hi guys.Ok....so about 10 day ago, I was sitting at my kid's band camp meeting.All of a sudden, I felt a ""pop"" in my head. The left uper side of my head to be exact. Feaked me ou!I didn't feel any kind of ""warm sensation"" like blood pouring over my brain, or, any type of ""fizzle"" afterwards. It mostly just freaked me out, and then I started to ""not feel right"". So I sat there waiting for something bad to happen, but hoping it wouldn't!Then, a few minutes later, another ""pop"" in my head around the same area. Started to REALLY freak out then! I was sure I was a goner!I emediately got up and went to the car and we left and came home.I laid down and tried to sleep it off. Sense then, I've been having that ""not right"" feeing in my head.Slight headache that seems to constantly come and go, even with taking Ibuprohpen. I can't seem to shake it, and the feeling of ""not feeling right"" seems to be permanent, and won't go away.I fear it could be a brain tumor, or something, starting to show itseflf.I plan to go to the Dr tomorrow to try and get him to send me for a CT scan or something. So, to sum this up....*2 ""pops"" in my upper left head.*Slight come and go constant headache.*Constant ""something's not right"" feeling.Thank you!!Ricky"

Headache,Headache and Neck Pain 5 Years,"I have been dealing with chronic neck pain and headaches for 5 years now. I have been to a multitude of doctors over the years to try and rule out various causes. My original fear was a brain tumor because the headaches are every day. I wanted to post on here to see if anyone has dealt with chronic neck pain and headaches and if so, what was the biggest help for dealing with them? I have tried chiropractor, massage therapy, dry needling all with little to no benefit."
Headache,Swollen head update,"hey everyone ive been on this board frequently the last month of so.ive been having some severe head pressure. not a migraine type. but more like a squeezing sensation.my ears are crackling and i have facial tension (when i raise my eyebrows i can feel the tension in my face)the pressure has been so tight that even my eyes seem to have gotten a little red (veiny)this all started when i had vertigo after flu-like symptoms in january. it eventually turned into vertigo. then ear pressure, facial tension.then my vertigo from my eyes went away. no more vertigo feeling! i dont feel drunk anymorebut that being said, i do get a little lightheaded due to the head pressure all over.i have no mucus, no fever.on top of this, i do have tingling sensations in my hands and feet, cold fingers and burning sensations in my feet.it seems whatever is going on in my head/neck is giving me peripheral neuropathy.worst of all, i can now hear my heart in my ears. and its pulses loudly. its hard to sleep. and my heart rate jumps so fast if i move in a different direction.not sure what the hell is going on, but my doctor did originally diagnose me with a brutal ear or sinus infection.which is odd cause i never had mucus, fever or cough throughout any of these symptoms.yes it all started after having flu like symptoms, but there was no fever and cough throughout the vertigo/heavy head sensations.its driving me crazy.any idea if my doctor is right? can an inner ear or sinus problem give me swelling of my head? (this doesnt feel like a migraine)"

Headache,Feeling zoned out/drunk with head pressure. Please help!,"Hello everyone.I came across this website while searching for the name of the condition I have been dealing with for close to one year now. I hope I can find someone that is dealing or has dealt with a similar condition as I am going through right now. I know that this post is very long so I thank you for your time in advance.I am a 22 year old male and I started to develop my initial symptoms from November 2018. My vision started to feel zoned out when I wasn't zoning out. I don't exactly know how to describe it but it kind of feels like when you are tipsy without dizziness. At times things around me looked slightly blurry. I know that it wasn't to do with my eye sight because a month before I had already got it checked and my eye sight was pretty good actually. So I thought that it was to do with my neurological stuff. I ignored my symptoms for a couple of months and finally in Jan 2019 I decided to visit a local neuropsychiatrist. The doctor prescribed me some pills which I assumed that it was for my neurological stuff but later found out that they were for depression and anxiety. By this point, I developed tingly, pulsating tension between my eyebrows and in the bones behind my ears.I was quite sure that my condition wasn't due to psychological causes so later in Jan I decided to visit a different neurologist in a bigger hospital. I got an MRI of my brain done which came out clean. The doctor told me that she sees nothing wrong with the MRI and that my symptoms are probably linked to my mental health. I took that advice and went to see a psychiatrist who prescribed me antidepressants. I was on the pills for eight months until this August. During the period of these eight months, my condition did not improve at all but in fact became gradually worse until present.My visual perception became worse. Although I can see everything fine it just feels widened out (if that makes sense). In other words, my eyes find it difficult to focus to the point that talking to a person face to face is difficult because the face of the person I am talking appears slightly blurry. I just feel like as if I am drunk or high (that is the closest to how I can put it into words). The tingly, pulsating tension between my eyebrows is still present and when it moves to the bones behind my ears, it feels like my bones are going to break. In addition to these symptoms, recently I started to feel pins and needles on my back. Sometimes it just tingles but sometimes I get this spot on my upper back, right below my neck, where I feel concentrated feeling of pins and needles. In fact, I didn't develop this symptom recently but had it March 2019 as well on my right side right above my lower back but eventually disappeared. The feeling has returned about a week ago. Another symptom that I have been dealing with is that when I turn my head or move my eyeballs, I sometimes get this jerk feeling which runs from my left chest to my left arm.Apart from my physical symptoms my cognitive ability has decreased significantly. I am not able to think clearly anymore. The condition I have been dealing with started to take a toll on me psychologically as well. I am not exactly sure who I am anymore and get this constant detachment between my physical self and mental self. I want to make it clear that the psychological aspect is a consequence of my physical condition.Until date, I have seen multiple neurologists but they haven't been able to figure out the cause behind my symptom since my brain MRI looks clean and the pills I took from my psychiatrists did not help me at all. This condition has really taken its toll on me to the point that I have even lost my zeal to live anymore. I don't like to get out to public places and meeting people has become really hard. If any one of you has experienced similar conditions or has any advice for how I should proceed with it such as medical tests and etc., please let me know. Your smallest help can really make a positive change in my life. Thank you for your help and time."
Headache,Odd Sensations in both Head and Body...Infection or something else? ,"Hi everybody, I'm new here. So for the last month or so I've been dealing with some crazy symptoms.It all started in late December, early January. I, along with my roommates came down with flu-like symptoms. Cough, fever, diarrhea, sore throat. Eventually we got over it. Or so I thought.A couple weeks later however, in the last week of January I started developing slight vertigo. The feeling would come and go but I would notice it mostly in closed corridors or whenever I was in the bathroom/taking a shower. Scary but I thought it would run its course.Well, fast forward a week later after that (early February), I started developing ear fullness, crackling and facial tension to join my vertigo. Every morning I could feel the blood from the back of my head rush to the front of my face. My eyes couldnt stay focused and I felt like I was on a boat. My head felt heavy, like someone tied a belt around it.Mother-in-law is a nurse and she checked my ear drums and noticed they were swollen. She suggested I take Sudafed and Motrin. It didnt help.I thought this was bizzare. Eventually it got so bad over that week that it made me feel lightheaded, almost like I was going to pass out.Thats when I went to urgent care thinking i was going to die. They ran some basic tests on me. Blood sugar was fine. Hemoglobin fine. Blood Pressure, tad bit high but probably due to panic attack. The doctor ran a basic neuro test on me where she made me follow her finger to finger, hands to feet, eye to finger etc. She also checked my eyes and ears and concluded that I must have had a migraine.A migraine...Ive had migraines before. This did not feel like any migraine.Well she sent me home with Zofrane, and Sumatriptan. It didnt feel like it was working. So a couple days later I saw a physician.At this point we are two weeks into the odd symptoms (starting with the vertigo). I explained the situation to him and he ran the same tests as the urgent care doctor (although I felt more comfortable around him cause he took his time to explain the situation).He concluded ear infection. Even though he saw no outer fluid, based on my symptoms ans story he thought middle/inner ear infection from a head cold that stuck around after the flu in December/January.He prescribed me ear drops with sulfate, Meclizine for nausea and Ibropufen for headpain.Well, its been two more weeks and I feel like my situation isnt necessarily improving but altering at times. My ear crackling comes and goes. Facial tension not as much.But I developed cold sensations in my hands and feet. Also, in certain positions my hands start to throb. Maybe its anxiety? Maybe a nerve issue?Finally my head now feels like a balloon! and when i stand up it feels like a cinderblock right in the front of my face. So much tension yet almost like a vacuum is sucking my head from up above me. Its causing me stomach pains and my bowels to be watery (maybe due to anxiety, nerves?) I can still hear my ears crackling at times. But its freaking me out.It feels best when Im laying down, but as soon as I stand up, I get that heavy, heavy feeling in my head and front of face. My stomach tenses up and its like I'm going to vomit if I move too fast. And my neck tenses up.I have a follow up appointment in April with my physician. Its hard to see him because I have Medi-Cal and my clinic has so many patients. And referrals are just as tough.Anyways, anyone have any idea what this could be? Labyrintitis? Infection after Flu? Cancer? Anxiety?My physician assured it wasnt serious but the symptoms feel serious..I was a fairly healthy boy up to this point. I went to the gym 4 out of 7 days a week.5'7175 poundsMaleFilipino/MexicanOn a side note, I took a blood test a week ago but still waiting for a letter back.These symptoms came on somewhat slow but progressed into something crazy.Any help would be greatly appreciated!"

Headache,Headaches when Singing,"Morning All - I hope someone can help.I have been the lead singer of a rock covers band for the last 5 years. I have been singing since the age of 5 and had singing lessons during most of my childhood up until the age of 18. Needless to say, I have been doing it 'properly' for a long time.Over the last 12-18 months, I have started to get some quite aggresive headaches when I am singing. When we play a gig, we usually do about 25 songs in a night over about 2 hours ish. However, towards to the second half of the night, I get these headaches which happen when reaching for slightly higher notes (although they are not out of my range or anything like that). I will sing the note and when I stop singing, the headache is immedaite for about 25 seconds before going away. During a gig, I very rarely drink alcohol as I will forget my words, so I usually drink water throughout the set with the odd lemonade in the evening. If I do decide to have a beer, its usually at the end of the gig.I am generally healthy other than this, but I am worried as I am only 32 and these headaches are slowly getting worse everytime we play a gig or do a practice. I am not physically sick or anything like that, but it does beat the hell out of me and I am so tired afterwards. There have been occasions where I have had to nearly abandon the gig because of the pain.Last weekend, we played a charity festival which we do each year. This has been the worst pain so far and even brought me to tears.I am going to go and see a doctor about this, but does anyone have any suggestions on this? I love my music and the guys in the band are close friends. But the pain I am experiencing is questioning how much longer I can do this for.Many Thanks in advance.Damien"

Headache,Pain above temple when breathing in ,"So for about 11 days now I've had a pain on the left side of my head just above the hair line and sometimes just above the temple which worsens when i breathe in through the left nostril.if i block the left and breathe through the right or through my mouth its not affected.I've had a ct scan of my brain which came back clear, i was tried on tramadol, paracetamol and co-codamol none of which has helped.the last gp i visited said due to it being affected by the one nostril it could be a sinus infection but my white blood cell count came back normal and i have no congestion or mucus and my face doesnt ache its literally just one localised spot on my head.has anyone experienced anything similar? really getting fed up with it as nothing seems to help, ive been started on a course of penecillin on the chance it may be an infection"
Headache,I’ve this pressure in my upper jaw and head for 3 weeks now,"I had a health scare on the 31st of December thinking i was having a heart attack due to pounding palpitations and had a bp of 159/85 and me being health anxious got very worked up about it. After a few GP and said it was stress and heartburn, it was fine, i made a life style change but was very anxious and constantly worrying about my heart.I then become flushed at night and pressure came about on my head. Crushing pressure yet there was no pain at all. in Mid January I had an insomniac episode that meant i had no sleep day or night for 4 days. I had called 111 and was given Diazepam.I then had a checkup and told the GP about my head and facial pressure. he gave me Bisprolol and it helped with my BP but my ""headache"" has come back and upper jaw feels like its being pulled constantly 24hrs a day, it feels like my teeth are going to fall out. Only relief is chewing or moving about. If you would like at me everything would seem normal.No one on the internet has seemed to have experienced the same thing and worried there may never be an answer."

Headache,Headache Behind left eye brow that comes and goes.,"it’s been a full day now that I have had a headache behind my left eyebrow area. It comes on every couple of minutes, and lasts for approximately seven seconds, then goes away. But it’s constant. It started yesterday around 2 PM. I am not in terrible pain, but it is always there. I have no idea what it could be, or how to combat it. I’ve taken Aleve, and I took an allergy pill to see if it could knock it out, and it did no good. Kind of concerned, just don’t understand what it could be. My diet hasn’t changed, I do play a lot of sports, but nothing has changed out of the ordinary. Any thoughts??"

Headache,"Pressure Headaches, Clogged Ears, Stiff Neck 2 years ","Hi Evergone! As you can see by my name, I have anxiety. It all started 9 years ago when my father commited suicide. I was only 21 at the time. My anxiety didn't hit right away, it slowly crept up on me over the years. I used to smoke a lot of weed growing up. But I had to stop because it only made it worse whereas before it used to be an escape for me. Things were going pretty well until an old childhood friend of mine, my best friend growing up, also commited suicide. That was 2 years ago. And that really hit my anxiety hard. I was super depressed. Had breathing issues. Couldn't sleep for days. And started getting debilitating headaches. I lost my job because I could no longer concentrate because the headaches were so bad. Shortly after the headaches I started to get a weird sensation in my ears like they were ALWAYS full. I got a CT scan, saw an ENT specialist and both told me that I was fine and that it was my anxiety. ... ever since then my ears have NEVER stopped being clogged. I pop them every day. And some days are worse than others. And some days the headhaes are worse than others. Truthfully I just started living with it because I didn't know what else to do. But in the last couple weeks it has gotten so bad. My head hurts so much I can barely think straight. I get up to walk around and I feel just 'off'. Like I need to lay down. And of course my anxiety takes me to the worst places. I'm not on my anti-depressants anymore because they made me feel suicidal and like I was a zombie. And then it's about finding the right ones for me, but I can't lose my job again. I finally have a great career. And now these headaches pop up again. All I can think is that I'm dying. That I have something like a tumor. It's all I think about (along with constantly popping my ears). I went back to the doctors a couple days ago and was prescribed a steroid nasal spray. And also told to use a nedi pot (the sinus flush) before the nasal spray each time to clear anything out and then spray. I know anxiety and depression can create physical sensations that are REAL. But what if I really have ETD? (Eustachian tube dysfunction) which is something to do with the middle ear and the pressure in your head because it is not right. And maybe this anxiety is only making it worse? How do you actually figure this stuff out? Do I go for another CT scan? What if I have something now that I didn't have 2 years ago in the first scan? It's just really scary. And I'm only 30 and I just want to feel normal again. Anyone have a similar story? Or anything at all? Please Hi Evergone! As you can see by my name, I have anxiety.

Headache,Suffering from daily headache ....,"a month ago i had a sinus infection that took one failed antibiotic which i did not finish and two rounds of antibiotic to get rid of congestion, but i am left with a daily headache! its very frustrating, the only time i felt relief is when I took steroids that were given to me with the last antibiotic- doxy. once i got off the steroid i felt the headache coming on again. i dont wake up with it but it develops into the morning. starts behind my eyes and as the day continues it moves to my forehead and also middle top of my head, then i might feel pressure again on forehead and behind eyes into evening time. what is this craziness? i never suffered from headaches before ever. i gave blood which came back with elevated WBC count as well as CT with no contrast that came back normal. i also feel a little relief when i lay down, or chew food as weird as that sounds. the pain for the most part does not exceed a 4. its more dull and achy and annoying. i have no other symptoms...has anyone experienced anything similar? did anything help you get relief ? is this dangerous ?"

It happens everyday although the intensity does change and goes from not being there at all to a dull hurting pain (about a 4 out of 10). I also feels like someone is pushing down on this part of my head to the stage where I can almost feel it in my mouth (hopefully that makes sense!)I can't seem to stop it and it is causing me to wake up at night, especially in the last week or so. I have noticed that it gets worse when my head shakes as well, for example when I am in a car and you drive over a bumpy road etcOriginally I thought it was anxiety but ive been far calmer the last month or so and this still continues. I have also put hot pads on my neck to see if that helps but no joy there. Has anyone else got any suggestions?"
Headache,Pain/Pressure In One Spot of Head - going nuts! ,"Hi all! I’m so thankful these forums exist.A bit of background. I would describe myself as a hypochondriac who also happens to be considered chronically ill. Always a sick kid, heart murmur, and chronic Lyme disease for the last 5 years. Lots of symptoms and complications from that - and also, a lifelong headache sufferer.Because of the way I am, I usually give myself a month of a symptom before I address it, to ensure I’m not biting the bullet. But this headache feel different...For a week, and out of nowhere, I have had what I can describe as a head pain on the top of my head - left side. It feels like a mix of sporadic ice-pick with tension/pressure the rest of the time. Unlike my most regular headaches, this is very centralized to that spot, at times ranging to my left temple and behind eye. Usually ibuprofen does the trick first time for me, but so far the only help is Aleve, and it wears off and returns after about 4 hours. I do suffer from stiff neck due to Lyme, so I often feel like my headaches could be tension related, spread from neck. But my neck had been fine when this started. It feels as if it runs up the back straight to the top of my head where it culminates and back down to my eye, and with one good crack of the neck, I’d feel relief! And yet, my normal neck relief strategies do not help.Naturally, I’ve consulted Dr Google and he thinks it’s a brain tumor. No other neurologist symptoms at this time.Any insight? Advice? THANK YOU!"
Headache,I have been experiencing a permanent headache for the past 9 months,"Hello everyone,I have been experiencing persistent headache for the past 9 months. It feels like pressure on my head like when you're doing too much exercise and you feel your head heavier and your neck tight.I wanted to share my story as I thought some of you might be interested in my symptoms, you might also have a similar issue or resolve your problem and want to share.Everything started last April while doing some pull up exercise at the gym. While forcing, I suddenly had a very strong headache on the left side of my head, what some call a thunderclap headache with an intensity of 9/10 I would say. This strong headache was very intense for a few minutes and got more manageable in the hour. Since this day, I don't feel myself anymore, like my head is heavier than usual most of the time and I feel pressure/tightness mostly on my neck and sometimes on the left side of my face. I never had much headache and never had migraines before that day.Over the following days/weeks after the first headache, I went to the emergency service where I had a CT Scan done which came back without any issue. I've seen a GP and she told me this is due to stress just like any regular tension headache. I had my eyes checked a few months before without issue. So I've decided to see an Osteopath to help out but without success, then a Chiropractor for a few months and it didn't help either, mostly improved my posture and another Osteopath which thinks it's a vascular issue and not nervous.Time passes and my headache intensified a bit. Last October and I decided to see a Neurologist which prescribed me an MRI of my head which came back normal. He then decided to prescribe some Propranolol to hopefully regulate my tension/blood pressure which is in average around 130/90.Today I still haven't figured out my problem. I wake up with a headache and I go to sleep with a headache. I still feel this heavy head, my headache varies from 3/10 to 6/10 in average.A few other symptoms of my headache which appeared over time since that first day:I found a few things which intensify my headache, one of them is an increase of blood pressure while I'm doing intense exercise or forcing. After swimming it also tends to intensify my headache for the rest of the day. What relieves it is when I'm relaxed, like when I go in holidays for example, but it's never completely gone.So far, no solution and OTC medication are not very helpful. I'm going to continue investigating. One option could be due to anxiety but I don't feel very anxious myself, maybe a little. Another option to investigate can be due to my sinus. I often have mucus in my throat even when I'm not sick, dry noise and dry blood in my noise the morning.It's a tough time for me but I won't stop investigating until I find a solution!Thanks for reading!"
Headache,Pressure on top (left) side of head,"Hello,I am hoping someone could offer some advice/insight (and I'll take some reassurance, too! ?). I'm a 41 year old female, in relatively good health - my weight/BMI are normal, I don't drink/smoke, workout 4-5x a week, vegan lifestyle. I've had a few health scares over the years (abnormal mammogram, thyroid nodules but all came back fine), so I am now plagued by health anxiety which has been the worst thing ever.About 3 weeks ago I noticed I started feeling spaced out. I chalked it up to upcoming holidays, being busy, etc. I also noticed when I would lay down to sleep it felt like my brain was shaking inside my head - like someone had injected my brain with a ton of caffeine and it had the jitters or something. In following days, I noticed pressure in my head, both sides at once - sometimes one side at a time. In recent days the pressure has been on the top/slightly left side of my head. The best way I can describe this is that it feels like someone is pressing down with their finger on the top of my head. My temples will also throb from time to time, as will the back of my head. Another weird sensation is that I can almost feel the pressure in my upper teeth - it's not painful, just a slight throbbing sensation. It has been making me feel very detached and just really 'out of it'.I do have blurry vision at times, but I also sit in front of a computer all of the time for work - I don't notice it much, and when I do I am able to look away/step away from my pc and it seems OK. I am not nauseous, I haven't been losing weight drastically, it doesn't hurt when I cough/bend over or anything like that. I've been going to the chiro since I know I have extremely tight neck muscles - I hold my stress in my shoulders/neck, as I am sure a lot people do. I had an MRI of my head in December 2018 and it was fine, I've also had a MRI of the thoracic and cervical spine in August 2019, and all was good there too. I do take Imitrix when I have a bad headache, as I have been prone to headaches all my life - but this pressure isn't really painful, just annoying and consistent. I also had my vitamin levels checked last April and everything was perfect - I was worried my B12/iron would be low given I don't eat animal products but I take supplements. My vitamin D was on the lower end, but still within range and I take a daily supplement for that as well.Any insight you could provide would be very helpful! Thanks so much."

Headache,"Suddenly had a headache, it's been over a year with them now ","I'm a 23 year old guy. Never used to have headaches at all, or any medical issues. In late 2018 i suddenly started getting them daily and now i have a terrible headache everyday. sometimes its so bad i vomit, or can't hardly do anything except lay down. they get worse when i'm standing, so Doctors thought it may be low csf in brain. ct and mri scan ruled that out. one dr said a lumbar puncture would rule out low csf completely, but another said he is sure its not low csf just based on mri. no meds have worked. especially bad in the morning, nearly impossible to get out of bed ....strangely recently have found if my neck is massaged before i stand up in the morning it helps immensely? any one else experience this? never had any head pain issues my whole life until this, desperate for help!"

Headache,Headache for a week straight!!!!,"I was diagnosed with sinusitis a week ago and completed the antibiotics for it yesterday. I am not congested anymore and all symptoms are gone other than the migraine/ headache that started when I got sick. It’s been going on for about a week now. It’s a dull pain all over my head especially in the front, I did feel some sinus pressure as well. I took Sudafed but it did not help that much. My mom thinks I have a head cold as well, but I have no other symptoms. Just typical migraine symptoms a little dizziness occasionally, light sensitivity etc. when I move my eyes makes my dull headache worse. I’m worried something else is going on, but is it just because of the sinusitis? How long is this going to last for? Anything I can do to help myself?"
Headache,"I’ve had a chronic headache all day, everyday for 11 month?! Help???","hey there. Im a teenager if that gives any extra information? So, early january, i got this bad headache. It was weird for me since i had never had any headaches before this day. So i took a few advil and carried on they did nothing. The headache lasted all day, then all week, then all month. Since then, more symptoms have been showing up. Currently, i get brain fog( confused, trouble with sinple math, bad memory, can't focuse on anything, brain lags, and i get lost on the subject in the middle of a sentence). Along with that, i get two different thpes of headaches usually. Usually an aching or clamping sensation, or an icepick headache, the icepick headaches last antwhere from 10 seconds to 5 minutes. The aching or clamping headaches rage in intensity from 2-9. They rarely go down to two or three though. Maybe one day a month is like that. They also switch intensities often but stay withing a range.( 2-4, 5-6, 7-9). They are usually moderate though. I have also found that i am starting to lack coordination. I trip on stairs, run into things, trip on air, and cant even hit a ball. One of the synptoms thats been around for a longer time(started 9 months ago) is this odd sensation that is indescribable. The best i can say is that my brain tingles. The headache is still there but it is that sensation added on. Or sometimes, theres another odd sensation that i have started calling head nausea. My head feels like throwing up. Its the same feeling you get in your stomach but I feel it in my head I am also sensitive to loud noises and strongs smells. There isn't any other way to describe it. If i smell someones perfume at all, Ill end up in bed for the rest of the day and skipping extra-curricular activities. I am currently on 10mg of amitriptyline a day. It is doing nothing at all. I feel like im at a stand still. Nobody knows whats going on and there isnt much i can do since no medicine has helped relieve any pain. And right now, we're just waiting to see if the medicine will help.(which it clearly isn't) I dont know what to do and am hoping someone recognises any of this or can help me somehow."
Headache,"24/7 Head pressure, headaches, anxiety, have had it for years, what should I do?","So for at least 2 years now, if not longer, I have had pressure in the temples of my head constantly all day, every day: non-stop. You see it always feels like the area around and at my temples is being squeezed by something sharp. And quite often I get sharp spikes of pain in that area as well. And this is on the good days. You see I have found something that has helped me, and it confuses me a great deal. That is learning, or using my brain intensely in some fashion such as math, or my favorite way, programming. You see when I am programming or doing some similar brain intense activity my symptoms lessen, the sharp spikes go away and the pressure in my temples feels as though it loosens. And the most important thing is it brightens my mood. You see one thing I failed to mention is that with the pain, if I have gone a long time without a brain intense activity my mood becomes horrible, I become completely unsocial, unable to muster any normal response to anything, and/or I become extremely anxious sometimes to the point that I feel as though I cannot breath and/or I become extremely agitated at the smallest things. And if I go long enough without any brain activities the sharpness increases at the sides of my head, get more painful, and even at times go to the back of my head. And these brain activities help, they make the worst symptoms go away, I can steal feel the pressure, and I still get the anxiety, but at least for the period I am doing them and a little time afterward, I feel alright. So it has almost become an obsession for me, to get home and do something brain intense. I am constantly thinking about the next time I can go home and program when I am away, it's almost to the point where I don't even know if I like programming anymore, or if I just do it to get rid of the symptoms. I don't like living like this. I want to be able to go on a week trip somewhere and not live every moment in pain and be a complete unsocial, anxiety ridden mess. I want to do other things other than the brain stuff, without preparing my self for pain. I don't understand any of it. The doctor thinks it's neck pressure and I am currently trying anti-inflammatory drugs (just started), not sure if they work yet. My family thinks its part of my sinus problems, since I've always had those. Honestly I don't know anymore. If anyone reading this has the slightest idea of what might help, or what it might be please say something, I am open to anything you have to say. I really want some hope."

Headache,Has anyone suffered from Amiodarone and Apixaben drugs,My husband age 69 who has never really been ill recently recovered from severe bronchitis and pneumonia which left his heart suffering Atrial fibrillation in March this year. The cardiologist put him on Apixaben 50mg twice daily Amiodarone hydrochloride 200mg daily whilst waiting for a Cardioversion. They made him unwell and he was not the man he was.He had the cardio procedure in September six months later with great success. He has a healthy heart but was told to carry on with medication.For years prior to his illness he suffered with regular migraines and had MRI's and blood tests and lots of medication. Of course he suffered overuse a build up with tripton.He managed to stop his migraines himself with diet cutting out Lectins and all sugars.He has a good diet and does not smoke or drink alcohol. Well since using this medication above the migraines have come back with a vengeance as well as vomiting. I also think they may have been aggravated by his cardio procedure.... I don't know.My husband has since taken himself off of his medication except Rizatripton because he feels so bad. He looks so poorly and I'm panicking. . . . . . Can anyone help?
Headache,"I’ve had headaches most of my adolescent years, seem to be worsening.","I am a 17 year old female and as long as i can remember, i have had these headaches which are tolerable. The reason for the headaches in the past were due to my eye sight and so i got glasses.My eye sight improved and so i was told i didn't need to wear the glasses anymore, which the headaches had gone for a while.However, over the last couple of weeks/months i have experienced headaches again but these are like nothing i have ever had and the pain rate is at the top of the scale at ten.The headaches would sometimes come on suddenly and aggressive like someone was hammering my head with a heavy object. It would worsen when i would stand up or try to do anything so i would have to stop until the pain subsides which will be roughly 3-5 minutes.Due to the fact i had mild headaches before due to my eye sight i thought that it could be that again, however having gone for a recent eye exam, it was shown that it not my eye sight and the opticians told me to seek help from the G.P.However, when these headaches are present i also experience problems with my right eye. First it was twitching, and it would seem as if it was sensitive to light. Then, my vision would go blurry in my right eye and no matter what i would do it would not subside (blinking) so i would wait it out until it would stop. As well as this i would often see little things floating in my view or sometimes i would see somethings to the right side of my body like dots of lights in the corner of my eye.A side from the eye twitching, i have also been experiencing more symptoms like my right thumb would start shaking for small time and then i would feel some type of sensation in my right hand by my wrist but further up the hand. I would also feel tingling in my left hand.Not sure if this is anything, but i would also hear my heart beat in my eyes. Like it was racing."
Headache,What could be causing this headache,"Hello EveryoneI've been having this weird pain in my head that started within a hour or so of waking up this morning, and was wondering if any of you have any ideas what could be causing it.The pain feels like a dull, tingling pressure pain at the top of my head that radiates to the back of my head. It's not too severe unless I move, especially when bending over, and when I cough. When I move and cough the pain becomes quite sharp, but settles down again when I have settled down. I'm not noticing any other symptoms, it's just solely the headache, and I don't usually suffer with headaches which is why I find it odd that it has just started today.Does anyone have any ideas what might be causing this type of headache? Any thoughts and comments would be greatly appreciated."
Headache,Constant weird feeling in head for a month,"Hello,Im a 26 year old active male and Ive had this weird sensation in my head 24/7 for about a month now.

Blood/Neurological/Hearing tests were all normal. Havent had any scans yet but considering it.

Headache,Headaches and neck/back heaviness doesn't go away,"Hello everybody, I am a 19-year old male from Singapore. There's this issue that I have been having since the start of Jan 2019. Whenever I would exercise (or just engage) my back and neck muscles, sit for too long or sleep on my right side, my neck/ back would feel heavy and stiff for the next couple of days. While this is bearable, the tough part comes as there will always be a headache accompanying it. The headaches runs from the back of my head all the way to the front of the head and eye sockets and it always only happens on the right side of my face. These episodes usually lasts for 3-5 days and happens about once every 2 weeks to a month. Every doctor I've been to says this is not a big deal and just prescribes me painkillers but it is clearly not helping the cause and it has been affecting my life severely for the past year. I have been to a specialist who took an MRI scan of my neck and theres was no abnormalities observed. I honestly have no idea what to do now nor do I know the cause of this but I know that I just cannot keep living on with headaches so often. Any advice would be very much appreciated, thank you."
Headache,Where to begin diagnosing?,"I’ve had neck pain for almost 5 years. I’ve had seizures twice in the past few years. Sometimes I get dizzy and my vision can blur or go dark when I get very excited. Sometimes it has felt as though tension leaves my neck and there may be a sensation of warm and throbbing lines across my scalp. There has been a tender spot on the crown of my head, where those lines cross. Today I feel as if that place has hurt, or simply been tender, all day.All this time I’ve thought that it was tension in my neck that caused it to hurt, and my left arm to feel numb or have pain, along with my left leg. I’ve thought that this same tension caused the weird sensation up the side of my skull and over the crown. However, recently there have been these sharp pains that come and go quickly across my scalp. And today this tenderness at the crown... I’m wondering if having a doctor perform a blood test to check for bacteria is a good step to take along with an electrocardiography.My thought about the blood test is to test for an infection. The reason for this is that I also have a rash on my wrist, what was a regular colored patch of skin with bumps I wasn’t used to season. These bumps have been around a couple weeks, I think. The area became inflamed yesterday and today. If a blood infection it could cause the other things... if I also have had unhealthy heart valves for some time, right?I've assumed that they are all related.What are ya'll's thoughts?"
Headache,Completely at a stand still got a diagnosis still scared ,"It started December 2018 I remember the night very clearly I was at home and I was listening to music loudly in my beats headphones and I was playing around acting silly and bobbing my head back and forth really hard violently as they do at rock concerts and after that I had went to sleep and I woke up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and I noticed my head felt funny a feeling I’ve never felt before no pain no nothing just a funny feeling but I didn’t let it bother me I went to lay back down thinking it’ll blow over which it didn’t then a couple of days later I went to the doctor and told them I had been having a funny feeling in my head there’s no headache it’s just a foggy feeling that I cannot describe and I told them what I had been doing the night I felt that but nothing had been done then I went back a couple of days later again and was given a CT scan, they said my scan came back normal as well as my blood tests I was then sent home. Still feeling the same way, mind you I am a very worrisome person so I started thinking about this everyday looking up symptoms on google scaring myself constantly months passed and I was still feeling the same way on and off that’s my only symptom it goes and comes back. Then I had an episode of heart palpitations that I believe had come from me staying up all night watching tv on the game and etc and falling asleep at 3,4,5 in the morning and sleeping and doing that over and over again which scared me and I was put on a heart monitor I had to wear for 2 weeks throughout that time I was constantly stressed out thinking about what was wrong with me I couldn’t sleep I barely wanted to eat and I started feeling funny my body had been tingling everyday non stop that eventually went away now back to the weird feeling in my head the not being able to sleep went away and the tingling went away. At this time I find out that I am pregnant i believe it’s April-May 2019 I’m super excited but yet I still have the odd sensation in my head I don’t know what’s causing it still, also I have this weird numbness on the right side of my face it’s not really a numbness like dentist numbness it just feels weird I can’t explain that too well either but I went to my primary doctor and she said it could be from unresolved stress and that it’s no cause for alarm so I go with that because it comes and goes and then I ask her could it be related to MS she refers me to a neurologist but before I see the neurologist I start seeing flashes of light in my eyes so I go to see an eye doctor he notices my optic nerve in my right eye is swollen and he asks if I’m pregnant I tell him yes he says this could be the reason why so he refers me to a neurologist I see a neurologist explain everything I’m explaining to you guys here and he sets up a MRI scan those were his words and schedules me for a lumbar puncture the same week I go for my MRI and then that Friday I go in for my lumbar puncture he tells me that my veins look fine and there were no masses found (I’m thinking this whole time I had an MRI but I really had an MRV) so I go back into panic mode because he tells me I have another MRI I have to take for my optometrist/ophthalmologist but he gave me a lumbar puncture *not too bad and told me that my CSF was mildly elevated and it looks like it had been for a while now im thinking the weird feeling in my head has been from my CSF being elevated I had some relief after the lumbar puncture but I’m back to thinking I have a brain tumor which is terrifying me I go for an MRI tomorrow and I just can’t even think straight I’m trying my hardest not to stress again because I’m pregnant but I’m extremely scared and I just don’t know what to do at this point. The diagnosis my doctor gave me was IIH (idiopathic intracranial hypertension) but yet and still I have to take another MRI tomorrow I’m so scared. In my neurologists notes he says awaiting MRI to confirm normalcy as expected that gives me some ease but not enough to ease my mind."

Last year I got so worried about them I gave myself horrible headaches that didnt go away until a doctor gave me some medicine.But this one is diffrent, ive never had a pinch/sting pain before, they started in august I think and they came and went occasionally, now I feel it a lot, and I know part of the reason is because I am overthinking it.Can someone tell me what headache this is and if its normal?? Its really scaring me."

Headache,What are these symptoms? ,"Hi everyoneSince the start of June, I have been getting headaches on and off, with neck pain which can vary in intensity , also on and off. I went to the Doc who checked my eyes and referred me for an eye test. I went along and the optometrist did various tests and looked into the back of my eyes with a special machine, and said there was nothing sinister to see. The headache is not really a headache as such.. it is more like pains in my head It feels like a burning sensation in the back of my head and at the top of my neck and sometimes at the sides it can be painful too. So i went back to the doctor, who checked my eyes again and said it's muscoloskeletal and prescribed me 300mg asprin to take when I get the headache. Since then, the last few weeks i have had a few episodes of pins and needles in my hand, and ringing in my ear, along with a bit of crackling sound, a bit of wax and wet feeling in my left ear. Has anyone else had these symptoms?"

I went to the doctor, she blamed it on a stomach bug but I am not buying it. It is really worrying me because it is absolutely not getting better. I cant even eat much at a time anymore without getting so full. I have taken Zofran, probiotics, and Excedrin. Nothing works. I am at my witts end with it. So miserable!!!"
Headache,Do I have a brain tumor? ,"I have had frequent headaches ever since I can remember. I got my first migraine when I about 11 and I get one about once every year since then - they're so bad I sometimes have to go to the ER. Ever since I was young I'd get headaches about every 2 or 3 days I'd say, but I can never remember ibuprofen or advil helping my headaches. (maybe thats because my mom started giving me ibuprofen a lot at such a young age so i grew a tolerance?) A few months back i got a sinus infection and had headache, ear pressure, eye pain etc. I took antibiotics and it improved but i had the feeling it never quite went away, but then i kind of forgot about it & just got used to it. I have a head ache every single day now - usually gets worse throughout the day but it still hurts in the morning. My eyes get strained & store really easily lately too. Too much light hurts but too much darkness causes eye strain. I've also noticed i have constant ringing in both ears and a pulsating noise in my right ear too. My neck always feels stiff as well and the pain goes up into my head. My question is, could I have something like a brain tumor thats been growing since I was little? Is this probably just my sinus infection that never went away? (but dont they usually go away after several weeks & can they cause ringing in ears?) Or could this be rebound headaches from taking Aleve & Excedrin lately? Please let me know what you guys think, I'm getting worried."
Headache,"Binocular Vision Dysfunction ( headaches , eye pressure, blurred vision, neck pain)","So I have been battling with severe pressure in my head in my eyes , blurred vision (always had perfect vision ) neck pain , ear pressure, weir spaciness or ""bizzed feeling"".I have been to many many Drs and had many many test. Sound familiar? Well I came across a topic on binocular vision dysfuntion and it lead me to the family eye care center in raleigh nc.. .... 4 locations ...new york, michigan, raleigh and charlotte nc.In their website if you go to dizziness and headaches their is a quiz. I really believe this is whats going on with some of us and its hard to be diagnosed as only a few Drs specialize in it and who would think its coming from misaligned eyes ! Its so many of our symptoms.........regular eye Drs cant test for it . I took the test and failed big time! Even the videos of patient testimonies share stories of constant headaches , spaciness, vision problems , neck pain.... the whole time its a inbalance in the eyes that prism lenses can fix. I also watched some videos on youtube.Please check this out and let me know what yall think or if u pass or fail on that test . Waiting for them to contact me back for appointment. Im really hoping this may be many of our problems here on the boards with headaches .Tonia"

Headache,"Headache, numbness, and feeling spacey","hey, so about 3 months ago i had a lumbar puncture done. i had it done because i was feeling dizzy and i had somewhat of a headache. 2 days later after that procedure, i had headaches everyday. the first month the headaches were so bad. like terrible, it got to the point where i would beg my parents to take me to the hospital, so that they could make the pain go away. now 3 months in i still have those headaches, but i so feel how my head or brain goes numb. it happens every time i stand up or sit up. i get this weird feeling like im in drugs or something. like i feel stoned. i have a lot of head pressure and pain in my head. i have this tingling that starts from the top of my head and it goes down. i have also started to feel numbness in my arms. my eyes hurt. i get throbbing in my head. i have fullness in my ears like theyre filled with air or like they need to pop. i get this spacey feeling. it kinda feels like nothing around me is actually real anymore. i can feel how that pain in my head moves around my brain. my doctor thinks the lumbar puncture triggered migraines, bur im not sure if it's that. i never had any of these symptoms before so its frustrating. due to all of this, i now started to have anxiety because of the non ending pain and numbness and everything i have explained above. no my symptoms are not being triggered by my anxiety. the headaches just never went away. i had really bad vertigo 2 to 3 weeks after the lumbar puncture. that gradually went away, but i still feel dizzy and that weird stoned feeling. before all this happened, i was working out a lot, and months later thats when i started ti get dizzy. i gave it a week, it continued, so i saw a doctor (not my regular doctor) but he said it was allergies. he gave me allergy meds, but it continued. i started to get lightheaded so i ended up going to the hospital. they just made everything worse with that stupid lumbar puncture because they thought i might have had meningitis. in my gut i had this bad feeling about letting them do this, but i was scared, so i said yes. now im stuck with these terrible headaches which by the way occur all day everyday, head numbness, and head pressure. any of you guys gone through this?"

Headache,Need Help - Worst Pain I've Ever Felt - 30 Minute Headaches,"Hi,My name is Cody. I'm seeking advice for a major problem I've been having. I'm a very healthy 25 year old but a few random weeks out of the year during the last two years I experience these headaches that are unlike anything I've ever felt in my life. During the times I get the headaches they usually come on once or at most twice a day and they last about 15-30 minutes. I've got a very short lead time where I can feel them come on, and so I'll take an Excedrin but it takes too long for it to kick in. When the headache is in full affect I have an unbearable amount of pain always in the same spot between my right eyebrow and my hairline, further up, so between my temple and center of my head. Sometimes the pressure surges and it almost feels like the pressure branches to behind my right eye. This could be coincidental, but it also seems like my right nostril has some sort blockage during the headaches as well and it seems to clear afterwards. Maybe it's all related to sinuses? I'm a very pain tolerant person but these headaches render me useless until they are gone. Can't think straight, get dizzy, and hold my head as hard as I can hoping the pressure will somehow affect the headache and make it go away. I'm not suicidal but when I get these headaches I think a hammer to my head would be a better alternative as that's how bad they are! Insurance is too expensive where I live or I'd just go see a doctor. Any advice on what these could be from and self-treating would be helpful.Thanks in advance,Cody"
Headache,Head pain for over a year,"i have had a really strange headache for over a year now. it started out of the blue with a few jabbing like pains on top of my skull, on the right side. its settled down to a continious dull ache in the same spot. if i bend over, cough hard or shout very loud i get a pain in the same spot which only lasts the duration of the movement. another symptom i have is my right eye ball has a dull ache as well.Ive seen doctors and neuro's and had an MRI which came back clear. i am now due an MRA to check the blood vessels.Im usually a fit 25 year old that plays quite a lot of sport. It's mentally affecting my life now and i think about it all day everyday.anyone else had anything similar?"
Headache,Plz help,I don’t understand what type of headache this is. I have one every day for the past month! It is always on the right side. Right on the right side of my front forehead. After an hour it’ll shift to the right temple. It is not a tension headache. It throbs. The headache feels mild but since I get them everyday it’s becoming annoying and I am getting frustrated with no answers. Two weeks ago I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder. My doctor said he aches are common when going through this. I am terrified I have a brain tumor and I cry every day thinking I am dying. Eveyone says I’m fine but I just don’t know. Advil and Tylenol don’t even help. Is this a migraine type headache? 
Headache,Shooting pain in head,"hey, so for a few weeks now I’ve noticed that whenever I step down too hard, bump my foot, (only on my right foot) or even bite too hard I get a shooting pain that goes up the right side of my head/right side of my forehead above my eyebrow. It isn’t awful pain, probably only a 3 on a scale of 10, and only lasts for a second. Is it possible it’s some sort of nerve damage?"
Headache,What could be causing this persistent pain in the top right side of my head?,It has happened in the past but usually goes away so I never worried about it. But it's these brief sharp pains that occur in about the same spot at intervals of a couple minutes or so. I also have experience eye pain in my right eye that usually lasts about a second or two. This pain is above my ear at the top right side of my skull. What could this be?
Headache,Tinnitus and debilitating headaches 24/7,"Although there are a few hours each day where I am symptom free, excluding the tinnitus, I suffer from debilitating headaches (mainly at my temples) and a constant ringing in my ears. This has been the case for as long as I can remember.Recent sinus x-rays ruled out any inner ear infection or actual sinus issue. I think it's the headache that is creating the feeling of severe sinus pressure.Unfortunately, I've been trying to kill the headache pain with Excedrin for many years, often taking several doses a day. It really doesn't help. Caffeine addiction?My question is this : What type of doc or specialist (online doc perhaps) would most appropriately be able to solve the problem once and for all? I honestly can't go on like this.Thank you in advance for any guidance."
Headache,Weird headache,"On sunday night i had a weird tingling (pins and needles) like sensation in my mouth (left side).On monday i woke up really tired with a headache behind both eyes.

No pain killer helped.Today (tuesday) i woke up feeling a lot better but still had a head ache behind left eye and temple. dont feel sick anymore but my mouth is still numb and tingly. My left arm keeps getting pins and needles.does any one know if this is a migraine or something else. i get headaches in my eye and feel sick every few weeks for no longer than a day but this time its longer.im 23 and female and im on the implant."
Headache,Continuous 24/7 headache for 2 years,"Hi there, I have had a headache 24/7 since 2 years ago. My symptoms are feeling mild pain and tightness around my head and I feel more tightness when I'm doing some particular activities like working in front of computer screen or watching movie in the theater. I have seen so many docs and taken many drugs, but the headache never goes away. Painkillers like NSAIDs never worked and I'm currently just only taking some preventive meds like Amitriptyline and Fluoxetine. Just want to know anyone else has the same or similar symptoms like me and how you get treated. I'm curious that I have the NDPH.Thanks for the comments."

Headache,Feel something in my left brain,"Hi, All. I have had manageable headaches since 2010, including lots of tests and meds. I am not seeking advice about that.

Headache,Head pressure and brain fog,"hi all,this is my 1st post and I have read many similar symptoms to my own. I am a 50 yo female and have had brain fog, fuzzy head and tinnitus (ringing in the ears) for 18 years. It all started when I had a huge meltdown after several personal issues at the time resulting in me not being able to cope. our toddler daughter was in isolation in hospital with a nasty virus which I later caught. I was feeling dizzy and disconnected and it took doctor's nearly 3 months to diagnose anxiety related depression and later on an anxiety disorder. during this time i got worse, became agoraphobic, lost 10kgs and was rail thin. I couldn't eat or drive. I have had MRIs, CT scans, many therapies including Reiki, massaging, psychologists, psychiatrists, group therapy, behavioural therapy, deep meditation therapy. I even went to Dr Charlie Tio (world famous brain surgeon) to see if i had a pineal cyst. I do have one but it's tiny and he told me 40% of the population have them with no symptoms. 've been on several antidepressants and still am. the symptoms of feeling like your ""not here"" on a daily basis and the tight head and tinnitus drive me crazy. my memory is crap at times which is frustrating. I have attempted suicide in the past just to relieve me of these symptoms. i felt terrible for doing this to my family but was desperate to escape the physical sensations in my head that no one seems to understand. doctors give me valium occasionally to reduce symptoms but worry it's addictive. over the years nothing much has changed except I do hold down a pt job. when it all 1st happened, i couldnt work for 18 months. it felt like a death sentence internally. I try to cope most of the time but wish I had my old life back. I also went through surgical menopause 7 yrs ago and things worsened for a while before my hormones stabilised through many trials with an endoxrinologist. I am looking into botox therapy which has been proven to help with head tension and sometimes tinnitus. I'm seeing a neurologist in a couple of months for a consultation and hopefully I will be considered a candidate for this new therapy. if anyone has had botox for their head tension, please comment on the page. it's had alot of research and success in the USA. knowledge is power and we can all use a bit of support and most of all HOPE. I can't imagine how much money I have spent over the years trying to ""fix"" my symptoms as they can be very hard to explain, as other's have said before. I have driven my husband mad at times but he is forever supportive, as is my daughter. in many ways I'm lucky for the support but these symptoms are draining and always literally "" IN your head"". because no one can see it, they don't get it! Thank you for reading my post. just writing this has made me feel a little less stressed. peace to you all. ?"
Headache,Caffeine withdrawl and its headache ,"HelloI am a 18 years old boy.

I have a serious to doctors unknown problem for which Id like to try my luck on these forums in hope of finding a cure. I have headaches - every morning and every afternoon.

Headache,Pressure in right side of head,"Hello everyone, my names Andrew. For about 7 days now I've had a strange pressure type felling in the right side of my head. It seemed to begin behind my eye, but then seemed to settle in the right temple for a few days. But for the last couple of days it's been in the back right side of my head. I wouldn't call it a pain, but pressure. I feel like that's an important distinction? I've tried to take pain killers but they don't seem to help. My doctors office can't see me for another week so I'm left to fend for myself until my appointment. If I'm completely honest I'm deathly afraid that I have a brain tumor. And I'm in a weird way happy to wait to go to the doctors office. I've only last week turned 26 and up til now everything in my life was going well for a change. It would destroy me if the worst should happen. I've had someone say that it could be a migraine, I've had another say it could be a head cold and catarrh. Ive been told it might be a nerve thing. Another person suggested I could simply need glasses. But I always worry about the worst outcome I can't help it, I'm a worrier. A few times I've felt a sort of tingly feeling radiate into the right side of my face, I'm not sure if that's important? My speech hasn't been slurred, nor have I lost any coordination. I haven't had any seizures either or the typical things you think of with a brain tumour, just the head ache. It doesn't seem to get better or worse no matter what I've tried. My vision is also ok I think. If anything Ive sometines got some floaters but that's nothing new for me. I need people to tell me that I'm overreacting and need to stop worrying, but if anyone can offer me some advice that would be great. Maybe if anyone has been in my position before and can give me some insight.Thanks, Andrew"

Headache,headaches-- heat in July,I'm so tired of trying to figure this stuff out.. These headaches are sometimes before my cycle BUT this month with the heat and rain I guess it could be due to the air pressure... Is this why ppl move to Arizona? Or could it be due to stress-- I don't consider myself to have a stressful life but sure I can ' over think' about stuff or have to deal with normal family things.
Headache,What could be causing my symptoms?,"I am a 21 year old male. Recently I've noticed that my right pupil doesn't respond to light as effectively as the left. When I looked in the mirror I noticed my right pupil was bigger when I wasn't facing the lights. Then when I shone my phone flashlight on it it would constrict but was slightly larger than my left. It also tries to grow bigger in the presence of the light shining into it but not too much larger than my left eye. I've also had this recurring pain on around and behind my right eye recently. It lasts maybe a second then goes away and doesn't happen again for hours or even days so I can't keep track of it. Also, two days ago I had this headache at the top right side of my head above the ear. From what I've read this is known as a parietal or nummular headache and is quite rare. At first, it was a small sharp intermittent pain that eventually grew into a tight squeezing sensation in my head. It went away mostly that same night but I can still feel a dull sharp sensation in the same spot on my head, but it's mostly subsided. I also have been having regular tinnitus in my ear for about a month now."
Headache,Thunderclap headaches for months ,"Hi, first time poster.I'm a 17 year old male, who has been experiencing thunderclap headaches since about January. I hadn't experienced this type of headache before and looked it up, and this seemed to fit my experience best. I had an MRI in February and it was all clear, but the problem persists. I've read up on these headaches and they're usually dangerous, like an aneurysm or something, with the only way to say they're fine being ruling out all real causes.I've been living in fear all this time, not doing exercise etc. in case it will lead to some bleeding. Is my head MRI a definitive 'greenlight' if you will, or do i need a CT scan etc. as well just to be sure. Other symptoms alongside this are dry mouth and a bloody left nostril (which i find very concerning).I just haven't felt like i've gotten straight answers on these questions in real life, partly because i only just found out about thunderclap, and was calling it Icepick before, so now i can focus on these specific concerns.Thanks for reading, and any replies would be appreciated."
Headache,Prolonged Headache,"So I went to the doctor two weeks ago now, I have had a headache for the past month. Pressure in my head, ears feel kind of clogged, eyes itch and I've been sneezing a good bit especially in the mornings.Thing is my headache never goes away. It hasn't affected my sleep thankfully. I can function but I don't feel good. Things that I enjoy I don't feel like doing at the moment. I have done a little research on cervogenic headaches, and think this may be part of the issue as my neck is pretty stiff. I am thinking of going back to the doctor and requesting an MRI, though when I was there last he said nothing that I said indicated anything nuerological, one thing about it I am getting tired of dealing with it every day. He prescribed some fioricet, it seems to take the edge off but the headache and pressure are still there no matter what I do.Anyone have any thoughts at all here?"
Headache,"Chronic, pretty severe headache for almost 6 weeks","I thought it was sinuses as it's happened before. Also thought it was my anxiety causing a stress/tension headache but literally nothing helps the pain. Some days are worse than others. I have pretty bad fatigue with it. I've taken antibiotics. Changed up my anti anxiety meds. Had a sinus CT. I am now on anti seizure meds to see if that helps. I have had cranial facial adjustments and chiropractic adjustments. I am at a loss and just can not keep feeling like this. Anyone have any recommendations?? The pain throbs in my temples, over the top of my head like a headband, and sometimes pulses in my face. I also feel it in the back on my head as well. I get bursts of pain on one side or another on occasion. it is not multiple headaches that come back, it is one long and constant headache."
Headache,Constant head pressure in the temples and eyes,"I have had pain and pressure in my eyes and temples for almost a year now. My face feels fuzzy and tingly and I feel woozy a lot of the time. Nothing takes the pain away when it is really bad. Tried Tylenol 3's and oxycocet with no relief. The only thing that helped with the intensity of the pain was Inderal (Proponolol) which is a migraine prophylactic or a high blood pressure medication. It relaxes the blood vessels. Even on the medication I had times when I still felt woozy and my face felt fuzzy and tingly. I went off the Inderal for a while as it also impacted my Gastroparesis and I am trying Flunarizine another migraine medication but not having much luck. I still have the constant pain and pressure in my temples and eyes on both sides. MRI on the neck and head were both normal. Really frustrated as I feel awful pretty much every day. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks,"
Headache,"WHY DO I FEEL DISORIENTED ALL THE TIME? I FEEL DRUNK WITHOUT DRINKING, clumsy, eyes issues?","I've always been a healthy and fit person but this is my story now. I started a new job as a London-double-decker-bus driver in November last year, everything was fine and normal but sometimes in mid January things became weird. At first I would feel like the bus i was driving was going to spin out. like when i would look at the mirror i would feel like the back of the bus was going to hit the parked cars along the road or sometimes it would make me feel like i was too close to the parked cars. I couldnt understand what was going on, at first i though it was my eyes that were getting confused with lots of the mirrors that those buses have around the driver. I carried on as I thought my brain was going to get used to it and would eventually adjust itself to it. Then things got worse, my right eye was strain with lots of pressure around it, then i started having headaches, chest pain, I would feel as i was drunk, things became unreal, where i would sometimes ask myself if the bus i was driving was real or even myself was really behind that wheel. Things escalated to the worse that one day I had to stop in the middle of the road as my brain got so confused that i wasn't no longer able to steer the bus. I got severe vertigo I didn't know where to go. i managed to stop the bus, i called my garage they sent another driver over to get the bus i decided to quit my job as i didn't want to put anyone at risk including myself. After loosing my job and without knowing what was going on with me and my brain, I plunged into a massive depression, worse mental breakdown, worse anxiety, worse stress etc. then I had, spinal cord and brain MRIs, tens of blood test, ULTRASOUND for all of my organs, ECG, ECHOCARDIOGRAM, exercise to monitor my heart activities all of them came back normal. I Decided to take a break, i left my job in February took a break and it's June, still getting vertigo, dizzy, i would feel like drunk especially if i bend down or talking to someone that i have just bumped to or just talking to someone seriously, after walking for a distance i would feel drunk as well. i had episodes of strong headaches where i even thought i was going crazy and now like it has been a month, my body feels awkward, clumsy, no coordination between my limbs, my shoulders are not aligned with each other (since birth) but now i can feel the difference which before was only visible when i'm wearing t-shirt, but now i can feel it, even my legs can no longer walk in accordance with each other, my spinal cord feels like its twisted and my eyes have got worse, they're straining, they're red very often and I can't see things on a strait line no more, it's either bent downwards or upwards. i forgot one thing before everything started it first began with my neck as those buses don't have headrest on drivers seat so i developed bad neck pain it was so stiff that my head felt so pressured to the point one day i got freaked out as i thought my head was going to come off my neck and was going to fall off my neck as it felt so heavy and i had wrap my jumper round my neck to sustain my head then after all the worse episodes i mentioned above started occurring. I hope someone will help. thanks for reading and sorry i was a bit too long."
Headache,I've been having heavy head and pressure for 4 months,"I'm 22, I'm been having head pressure from last 4 months exactly 4 months back I've had a thing like panic attack cause i was having pain in my stomach and thinking about the same cause of the panic attack and i never had it again the stomach problem resolved in a month but since that day my head has been heavy, feels like my brain is being pulled upwards, there is no pain at all, no headache, no neck pain, annoying wired feeling in head, feels like pressure 247 not even a second i feel like normal. I've tried 4 to 6 doctors 20 to 30 medications, done with MRI and CT scan of the head and also X-Ray of the neck for leakage but everything came out clear. The last neurosurgeon advised me to stop all the medications as there is no medical problem and asked me to relax, have fun and meditate. I tried meditation and other relaxation Technics but the pressure won't go away. As far as i searched on internet they say it's anxiety but i don't feel anxiety every, no depression nothing, never afraid or scared of anything. From last 4 months it has reduced about hardly 10 to 15% since the initial stage and hoping every morning to wake up with me being normal again."
Headache,Head pain right side above eye area when I bend over? ,"I've had it for about 2 weeks now.My whole head hurts on bumpy roads. So much so that I started driving very cautiously, paying extra attention to road surfaces.So I guess you can say sudden movements causes my head to hurt. But the pot holes are the whole head. The rest of the time it's almost always only the right side, at a spot between the top of the eye and the temple area.So looking from the top of a head facing north, imagine the head is divided into 4 sections. It would be the top right side.The pain is most prominent when I bend down. It ceases almost completely when I am upright. It's definitely there even without any movements, but to a much lesser extent.It feels like a tension/pressure pain. Not sharp or crippling, but rather dull. On a scale from 1-10 (10 being killer pain), I'd say it's a 5 when bending down...3 when sitting still and not making sudden movements.I tend to notice it more waking up in the morning, especially rising off bed.I've considered sinusitis. But I don't have any of the other symptoms. No discharge whatsoever, haven't had flu/cold for as long as I can remember, no nasal congestion.I do have rhinitis though. Had it all my life. I don't take anything for it. I only do when I have an episode, which are triggered by dust mites and pollens mostly. Haven't had any lately. Also, even though I've had allergy my whole life, this is the first time I experience this headache.I also considered migraine. But I don't have any of its other typical symptoms - no sensitivity to light or noise, or smell.Any idea what I'm suffering from?"
Headache,Head and neck discomfort,"It started as a headache and now i have pain in my neck and shoulders and a bit in my chest. Slight pins and needles in my fingers , a lot of tiredness and weakness and trouble focusing on words on a page. I’ve been for an eye test and they couldn't see any abnormalities in my eye health , everything looked healthy. Ive had lots of anxiety and 2 panic attacks, as I've been worried about my symptoms, IVE GONE FROM THINKING i have a brain tumour, to angina to Ms. I went for a sports massage and there was a great deal of tension in my shoulders and neck which she said has probably caused my headaches but would this cause the tiredness weakness pins and needles and focus problems? I have complete mobility in my neck so i don't think it is a trapped nerve?My full blood count came back normal as did my thyroid check and crp."

I keep having these really weird episodes which are so difficult to describe it feels like my head is going to pop off!! The only way to describe it is like a wave of fuzzyness going through my brain, like i have pins and needles in my head and a thousand hands and squeezing it.

The episodes only last around 30 seconds to a minute but they are really extreme and just really odd. im also noticing i have alot of flashes of lights in my eyes and blurred vision.

Headache,"Major Headache Problems, Eye Pressure and More!","HiThis was posted to the migraine forum but it seems much less active than the Headache forum, so I'm posting it here to hopefully get more feedback which I am desperately in need of.Long story short - I've suffered from headaches and tension type headaches for many years but its getting really really bad now. I have been to 2 neurologists about this in the last 2 years, had a brain scan, blood tests - nothing! They say take medication and that's all.Headaches sometimes triggered by computer use but also develops on random occasions.Symptoms - Very deep headaches right behind both eyes, headache in middle of head to front - sore, inflamed nerves right on top of scalp (hurts if you touch this area), inflamed occipital nerves at back of head. Ache/Stiff feeling extending down neck to base of neck. Sometimes causes me to feel ill to my chest and stomach but sometimes not. Feels achy/sore at base of neck but also sometimes only mildly in neck area. Cannot think or even function - makes me want to sleep. Had moderate results with physio but then my body almost ""Resets"" itself after a few weeks back to normal. Moving my jaw makes like a crackling feeling behind my eyes. It's really unusual but so bad.Cannot figure it out. Seems like its referred pain/headache from problems in my neck/spine but unsure. I have not been able to go out for 9 days now its been so bad. What should I do?"
Headache,laughing induced headache,"Hi Folks,I'm 28, male. This started in April. Whenever I laughed hard, i feel some weird type pressure in my head, somewhere on top of my head and radiates around my forehead and sinus area. it's hard to describe, it's not super painful just a dull pressure which is close to tension-type of headache.. i'm not sure what's going on but it almost feels like my blood vessels gets constricted or something like that, it really annoys me and it makes me extremely worriedI must also mention that, I experienced chronic tension head in March which my doctor believes is directly linked to my TMJ-D (my jaw pops/clicks when I mouth widely, sometimes when I chew). I had a CT scan in March and it was clear but I started to experience this April, should I get another brain scan?My second thought is I have anxiety (I had episodes of panic attack) maybe it's related to it? Any advice?"

Headache,Lumps at Base of Skull / Severe Headaces,"The symptoms listed have been my battle for some time now. Recently I had ACDF surgery and I suppose I thought everything that had gradually gotten worse over the years would miraculously get better with this ""fix"".

Headache,Incidental lipoma in brain,"hi hi all, I'm sure a lot of you have read my posts and know who I am. I have suffered health anxiety for the last few years now mostly concerning my heart and my brain. I have been suffering from what I thought was migraines since last summer. I went to the neurologist at least three times last year and they did two CT scans on me which all came back clear. I had what felt like the worst headache of my life along with a lot of migraine symptoms. my neurologist did not want to give me an MRI but finally did about a month ago. well I finally got the results today because of phone tag issues and it turns out that I do have what's called a incidental lipoma brain tumor. no words can describe how I feel and how angry I am but nobody believed me for the longest time that something was wrong and all this time there was. they have referred me to a neurosurgeon to see what the next step is going to be. so if I have one piece of advice for anybody who is suffering with headaches is to please please get what you need to find out what is going on with your body. next is is there anybody anybody who has any experience with this type of tumor? I have no idea how long it's going to be until I get into the neurosurgeon to get all the answers I need to my questions and I absolutely will not Google anymore! thank you for reading this long post!"

Headache,Hard blood and mucus fell down throat ,"Had a bad bad headache for a couple days and a sore throat and night sweats... no coughing not wheezy etc. I felt a hard big lump fall into my mouth so I spat it out, I didn’t cough it up. It’s hard like a haribo sweet"
Headache,"Chronic headache above right eye, so far it's been going on for 1.5 months","Month and a half ago I woke up and realized I had throbbing headache above my right eye. Since I never get headaches (I have no idea what a migraine feels like), at first I thought it would go away on its own. It didn't, I only felt relief after taking one ibuprofen ( 200mg pill).Six days after my headaches began, I got a cold. Typical symptoms - runny nose, headache (different type), achy body. I treated it with OTC medication and ibuprofen to alleviate sore throat. Four days later I felt better, and since I wasn't regularly taking cold medicine I realized I still had a mystery headache.Fast forward a week, I went to my Dr. and she said I possibly had a sinus infection. I was a bit skeptical, can someone have sinus headaches six days before feeling symptoms of a cold? But I went with her plan anyway and got my prescription for three days of steroids (prednisone) and ten days of antibiotics. While on steroids I didn't have headache in the morning and the afternoon, but by evening I had to take ibuprofen to alleviate the pain. By day seven it was obvious that I never had a sinus infection, so I scheduled a follow up appointment.At my second appointment the Dr. told me that my headache didn't match any of the symptoms that associate with migraines, cluster or tensions headaches. At this point I need an MRI, and if something doesn't look right a referral to a neurologist. So far I've been waiting for a week for my insurance to approve MRI. No answer and I don't know what to do and what steps I can take next. I have no idea how much longer it will take to hear back from the insurance company. I've been calling Dr's office almost every day for an update, they just keep telling me the request is pending. Anyone else has similar symptoms or advice on what I should do next? Is getting MRI so soon drastic? It seems it escalated fast - first I had sinus infection, next thing I know I need MRI. I'm so lost...Here are more details about my symptoms:Headache goes away every time I take ibuprofen. Most of the time one pill does the trick, occasionally I have to take two pills. In 24 hour period I take medication three times (approx every 8 hours). Headache comes on gradually, usually it takes 15 minutes.Throbbing pain above right eye, on scale of 1-10 I would say it's a 5 but it bothered me enough to make me cry.Absolutely no neurological symptoms: dizziness, seizures, blurry vision, speech issues, etc.Normal temperature, hear rate and blood pressure, plenty of energyI don't consume red meat, dairy, alcohol, coffee, flour (breads, pastas, cookies) and I drink about 90oz of water every dayI'm not overweight and I do some type of physical activity daily. I sleep through the night, but lately I've been taking one OTC sleep aid before bed. Mostly because my current situation is stressing me out.I'm a female in my early thirties"

Headache,Anyone else experienced these symptoms?,I've been have some weird headache the past couple of weeks but it's been constant the past few days. so I've realized I have a dull tense headache feeling the past couple of weeks but I've always just figured it was due to anxiety. but recently it got alot worse I was laying in my bed in an awkward position looking at my phone when I started to be a big pressure in my forehead and face in the bridge of my nose. this pain has been changing in severity throughout the day its minor when I walk up then gets severe and mild and keeps changing throughout the day. past year or so I've head neck problems and sensory issues which have resulted in nerve damage. my neck has also been feeling stiff this past month. I've also had a ct scan last year of my brain cause of one sided weakness but nothing showed up. anyone have any ideas?
Headache,Chronic Tension Headache has severe upper back pain on right side for 6 years ,"I have been suffering from a permenant chronic tension headache, severe tightness around my right temple on the right side, neck pain, and severe muscle pain/knots by my right shoulder blade and in my right lat. it’s been 24/7 for 6 years.I’ve seen my GP numeous times over the years, seen a Nuerologist, had nerve block injections, MRI’s, long courses of massage, accupunture, osteopathy, physio, posture correction...EVERYTHING.It’s not daily or weekly pain. It’s been pain and chronic tension severely prohibiting my life 24/7 with no let up for 6 years. No one seems to have a solution or cause. I have to lay on a tennis ball on my upper back whenever I can for minor relief.It’s ruining my life, and making me not go out, constantly miserable and ruining my work and social life.I haven’t had Botox or an trigger point type injections.The only thing I can attribute, is that ive used cocaine recreationally for roughly the same period of time, and probably 2-3 times a week, with alcohol. Ironically, whilst doing it, it lessens the pain and tension. is this?"
Headache,Headache in the same spot for 6 months! What can this be? ,"So I've been suffering from migraines for years but it seems as I've been having headache every single day for the last 6 months. It's usually triggered when focusing while driving, bearing down when having a bowel movement, bending over, and turning my head suddenly or too quickly. The pain is always on the left side of my forehead, right above my brow, and often feels numb and tingling and the pain extends behind my left eye. My headaches do let up when taking excedrine migraine and sumatriptan. However I feel like I am becoming reliant on meds to be able to function. I have a mri scheduled for tomorrow and I am beyond nervous because I am worried it will be a tumor or something that can change my life forever.Any ideas what this might be? Thanks in advance!"
Headache,Is it normal for pain and pressure to worsen when bending over?,"I woke up this morning with what I assume is a tension headache: aching neck, headache on one side of head and behind one eye, slight nausea. But when I bend over or move my head too fast, the pain and pressure increases a bit on one part of my head. I was just wondering if this is normal in tension headaches, and if not, is it usual with other headache or migraine types?"
Headache,Severe headache before and after landing on Spirit Airlines...,"On a recent trip from Latrobe,Pa to Ft Lauderdale Fl, I experienced a severe headache in my head towards the sides and front and especially in the ears. This was unlike any pain I have ever felt before in my head. IT WAS HORRIBLE! Even the next day I didn't feel too well bc of this. My ears kept popping and i still had a headache, some ibuprofen helped to ease the pressure and pain a little bit. I have to fly back today and Iam going to try some spray or sudafed 45 minutes before we land. Also read about pinching my nose and blowing pressure back out the ears. I believe these airlines ascend and descend too fast. Our flight was supposed to be 2 hours and 15 minutes long and we arrived in just under 2 hours. This was only my 3rd flight and the other 2 I didn't experience this at all. I do believe I may have had a slight sinus infection bc I was dehydrated as I often am bc of my job. I just wanted to start a new discussion to see If anyone else experienced this on these airlines. And maybe any tips and tricks to try to help with this. I was reading a discussion on this site, but couldn't reply to anything bc it was years old and I figured I'd start a new discussion that maybe able to help other.

Headache,Weird headache ,"So I've been getting this strange headache more and more often as of late and not sure what to think of it. Its not really painful, but more just annoying and a weird sensation. It feels like a tightness/pressure in my forehead, and it feels like my head is underwater. Ive had it for at least a few months, seems to be getting more pronounced though over the course of the last few weeks or so. Sometimes its hard to go to sleep or concentrate because of it, it never wakes me up when I am asleep. It seems to be worse in the morning and then gets worse as the day goes on. Somedays I dont get it at all, but Id say I get it 5-6 days out of thr week. I dont really have any other symptoms, but i did have a spinal tap and an Epidural blood patch back over the summer to correct for spinal headache. Did some research and saw that increased CSF fluid or CSF hypertension in the forehead might be the case. And Im always paranoid of brain tumors. Any thoughts or ideas? Should I see doctor about it?"
Headache,HEAD PAINS,"About 2 months ago I started experiencing, on a daily basis, an unpleasant burning & tingling sensation in the top of my head which then became a dull & prolonged ache. I also get random darting pains in other parts my head and sometimes face. The problem doesn't bother me at night so, thankfully, my sleep is not disturbed but it does tend to get worse as the day progresses. Prior to this I did have frequent 'zap ' like sensations in my skull.I have been to my GP who has conducted a number of sensory tests which were normal. I've also had blood tests which were also normal apart from the Thyroid test which was borderline. I've been advised to have a retest in a few months.The original diagnosis was tension headaches but now it's been suggested that I have neuralgia. I was initially prescribed 10 mg of Amitriptyline per day but this didn't significantly improve the condition. I've now been prescribed 30 mg per day. I've only been taking this dose for a short period of time so it's too soon to know if it's having any impact.I'd be interested to know of any positive stories about this treatment or indeed of any alternative treatments as this is a very unpleasant & worrying condition. I'm 65 & am generally very healthy. My only other medication is Citalopram which I've been taking for about a year for hot flushes which I have been having on and off since the start of the menopause."
Headache,Headaches approx 3 years. Advice welcome.,"I have been suffering headaches for three or so. I had an eye which showed there was slight changes to my sight and i received a new prescription. The optomotrist explained my eyes were not causing the problem. i plodded on with the headaches as they were not very problematic. However over the last few months they become more painful both tension type and migrainous. I do not take anything for the pain unless i have to. i visited my gp who completed a fundoscopy which came back on both occasions. i was eventually given propanalol which initially helped however over the last 10 days i have had faily headaches again.Nothing has changed as in worries, anxiety etc. I am on Cerrelle since 2017 and i changed medication in 2018 for arthritis pain.

Headache,Headache for 5 weeks-HELP ME!!!!!!!,"Hello readers,I am a 12 and a half year old girl. By the way, I'm not pregnant, and haven't started my periods yet. I have many friends, don't feel too stressed and I'm a high achiever. I came home from school on the 2nd of May with a banging headache. I tend to get headaches a lot anyway so I thought it was one of those that went after taking Paracetamol. I have a family history of migraines and my mum is on a Beta-blocker daily, which got rid of them!Right, I will list my long list of symptoms. This headache has lasted 5 weeks. It is continuous and rarely goes. It is there when I wake up in the morning and also when I go to bed! For the first half of the 5 weeks it was like a band around the top of my head, however, now, it is mainly at the back. I feel like there is a lead weight tied to my skull. It is also worse with reading and loud noises. There are also other symptoms:- I struggle to get to sleep and recently, it has woken me up at about 5am and sometimes up to 3 times in one night .- Also, I have felt sick on and off for much of the time but have tried to eat a normal diet.- Also, I have changed temperature a lot and go suddenly from freezing cold to boiling hot and sweating.To get rid of these symptoms, I have been to the GP 5 times. They told me it was a virus the first couple of times and that I should take Calpol, Iburprofen and Paracetamol. Later on, I was told to try Co-codamol, which gave me bad side affects. The second to last time I went, I got a referral to CDU (Clinical Decision Unit). The last time we went, my referral was sped up. I went to CDU last Wednesday, where they did neurology tests, like reflexes. Then we had to go up to the eye hospital and they looked at the back of my eye- retina, optic nerve and so on. Everything was OK. I went back this week and they took 2 blood samples, which were fine and they did an MRI scan, which was fine.I was told to avoid taking anything, so I have. I found headache cooling strips helpful for getting to sleep. I have also been to the opticians and all was OK. I have been doing a headache diary as well.I have had 4 weeks off school and can't read without it getting worse. I've missed the end year tests. I can't go on like this! I tried school and everything got worse. We've rung 111 twice and they weren't particularly helpful. I've also been to 2 pharmacists. I need some help.Thank you for reading, if you managed to last that long. If anyone out there has similar symptoms or is a health professional or knows anything, please reply.SORRY FOR ANY SPELLING MISTAKES.With regards, Jemma (JEMSTONE49)Hello readers,I am a 12 and a half year old girl.

Headache,Headache and hot sensation on left temple. What can this be? ,"Hello all,I want to make this brief. So since elementary school I have been suffering from headaches. My Dr at the time associated it with eye straining and had me wear glasses, however the headache still always remained and I've learned to deal with them by resting or taking over the counter pain reliever. Now that I am in my adult hood, the headaches have now been fully diagnosed as chronic migraines and I take sumatriptan and excedrine migraine to get temporary relief. It seems as within the last 6 months my headaches took a turn for the worse as I am now experiencing severe symptoms. I am a 34 years old female and here are the symptoms I now suffer with.Localized pain only on the left temple above eye brow.Pulsating hot sensation on left temple.Severe headache when bending over.Severe headache when having bowel movement.Sound sensitivity and pain with loud noises.Ear ringing and vertigo.Eye floater in left eye for the passed 2 years.Flashes of light when eyes are closed in both eyes.Nausea usually by the end of the night.Weakness/flu like symptoms without fever on site of migraines.Pressure in head and eyes like my head will explode and eyes would pop out when laying flat.Loss of appetite usually by dinner time.Today I've had blood work done and I am waiting to get my official MRI date scheduled. I'm really trying not to Google my symptoms so that I don't scare myself however I have and that's why I am here looking for answers. Any bit of help would be greatly appreciated. What does my symptoms sound like?Thank you so muchElise"
Headache,Headache for over 2 weeks ,"hi eveyonei am a female and i am 25 years old: i have started getting a headache for over 2 weeks now. i started getting a right side throbbing pain coming to my right eye.however now i am getting it in the middle like a headband burning me or like something heavy is on my head at the crown. this happens to me everyday, the only time i am okay is when i am asleep.i have been doctors and a&e for this. doctor thinks its nothing serious and said to avoid a CT SCAN as i am trying for a baby. I FEEL LIKE IVE GOT A SERIOUS PROBLEM. i am googling symptoms all day ?i have tried soooo many painkillers like codine and a few others but nothing is helping.ANYONE EXPERICNE THE SAME!??"
Headache,Neck and foggy feeling/headache?,"Hello!How are you today?Feeling it time to post a bit.Fast forward, swapped up my primary care doctor about a year ago and started running test and getting on top of myself. I always had anxiety - so I freak out about little stuff and make it into a big deal. I guess that is me?So first time around my blood work had low Vit B12, D, Folic Acid - They gave me some super prescription and I took it. B12 and D went back up, but not sure on the last round if they managed to stay the same, from what I remember.I was also complaining about my Neck. He sent me off to an MRI, last year about 1 year from now. The results came back with disc herniation, I think it was 2 areas. That was about it. I went to a specialize and they gave me some muscle relaxers - but I didn't try any. I sometimes take Tylenol or Advil which some sometimes. The pain for me is not intense where I am home bound or can't drive but I do feel off.He did recommend physical therapy but I haven't started one bit. I have been very busy but this has come all of a sudden, which sucks.I wake up with my neck in pain, now I am not sure where the root is coming from? I know if I move my neck after sleeping I definitely hear the cracking as I turn left and right. Now I sit in an office all day and I feel as I can pin point the problem in my neck if I was to touch it. All day I feel pressure on the back of my head/but more the neck area as it is just a dull ache all day. If I turn my neck left and right fast/it is not pain or restricted but but I feel the pressure, but maybe it is normal? Sometimes I feel as my eyes need more focus on the computer screen as well.Some days, I will feel like a little nausea not ready to throw up, but just off.Some more pointers:I like to add, I was on Metoprolol for about 6 months. I went to my Cardio doctor and happened to be just worked up and they put this on me, sure my pressure was a little high but mostly for the fast beating heart rate. After the heart rate was not really bothering me or so, we came off of it and I was put on Losartan 25MG, once a day. I feel since I went on this thing, maybe this is causing this to me? I just checked pressure and I am at 125-82-85, etc. Wrist monitor so not crazy accurate probably. Losartan list headaches/dizziness as a side effect?Other then that: I take Klonopin as needed .5 to 1.0 if needed for anxiety attacks.Might I add, some dental work that is needed. I did a cavity fill last week, but still feel a pit of pain in jaw area. I am going back tomorrow as I need some more."
Headache,HEADACHES!!!!,"Hi everyone for the past 3-4 days I have been getting a few tension headaches and also my neck may be the cause of it, it's not constant and it's not painful. Anyone have any ideas? Or what it could be! Thank you"
Headache,been having mild headaches for over a month - on daily basis,"Hello forum,I've been having mild headaches around my forehead above my nose and between my eyes, down where my temple or within that area and sometime on top of my head and sometimes on the back of my head. I think this all started because over a month ago I was meeting this girl and I was very nervous I drank tons of water and ever since after that I've been having these daily headaches. I've told some people about the water thing how I drank too much in short period their response was you'd have peed that stuff out its not the fact that you drank too much water. I've seen my doctor and she said it could be pressure related headaches I still need to get my blood work done. I've checked my blood pressure and its normal. So not sure, what the problem is.If you have ideas of what it could be please advise."

It will be greatly appreciated to know if im not the only one."
Headache,Sex headache or something more serious?,"Yesterday my husband and I were having sex and upon climax I suffered a sudden intense headache across my forehead. The initial burst of pain subsided after about thirty seconds and faded into a dull, barely-there pain. It was not the worst headache of my life, but it was still fairly painful and I've also never experienced anything like this before. A cursory google search indicated this was probably just a 'sex headache', and I've been headache-prone my entire life as well as dealing with migraines since I was 15 (28 now). Last winter I had an event while at a stoplight where my brain and vision felt like they were rattling from side to side and I thought I might pass out, though I was lucid the entire time. My best friend who is epileptic says it sounds similar to a seizure she's had before. I'm setting up an appointment with a doctor right now, but I'm beginning to worry that this is serious and not just anxiety, which I do have a significant problem with. Please help ?"

Headache,Pulsating head veins with headache ? ,"So over the past year Out of no where I began to develop tension type headaches that go along with my heart rhythm. along with this, the temporal veins on my head swell up and pulsate. This also can happen when I am working or working out and also during a warm bath or shower. When I lay down I can feel my pulse in the back of my head as well. The only thing I can think of is last august, Out of nowhere I felt a flick in the back of my head, almost as if someone flicked a penny or acorn at me. My vision got blurry and I felt out of it for a split second. Nothing came of it though. Also an mri was done and nothing was out of the ordinary. Any advice helps. The only other possibility would be low body fat percentage ? I am 9.8 percent, at 6 foot 2 and 180 lbs. I am active in cardio and weight training as well. No drugs or alcohol and no meds"
Headache,2 month long headache and b12 deficiency - driving me insane ,"Hi, I'm 19 and my constant tension headaches started around 2 months ago now. Sometimes it's just pressure and most of the time it is both pain and pressure around the whole of my head. I also get stabbing pains in random areas. My neck also hurts sometimes and feels like the nerves in my back, neck and head are almost being tickled?! I had some blood tests a few weeks ago and it revealed I have a b12 deficieny. My thyroid was also right on the borderline of being low but must not be something they're overly worried about since the doc didn't mention anything else about it apart from it might be making me even more anemic. I've had 5 b12 injections over 2 weeks and for a few days my headaches did for the most part FINALLY stop. However, I kept feeling a niggling at the back of my head that they were going to start again and sure enough they have. Every time I go to the doctors they just put it down to my anxiety and I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I'm obviously worried it's something more serious, or maybe I need more b12 injections or maybe I'm just a medical freak I don't know. But it's affecting my life - I keep having time off work and often have to cancel plans with friends because my head is so bad and I'm so tired. Anyone else in the same boat??

Headache,Headaches for last 4-5 Months and Neurologist and ENT can not agree on cause,"For the last 4-5 Months or more i have been having headaches daily behind my eyebrow which originates i believe in the Frontal Nasal. On this side i have a large bump which is harder than bone. First few doctors said it was an Osteoma. But that has been ruled out and ENT which did CT basically punted me to Neurologist because ruled out Osteoma to address headaches (which some numbness around eye and check occur). Neurologist ordered MRI which he said shows air trapped in Frontal Nasal putting pressure which has pushed bone up and putting pressure on brain probably causing headaches and my other issues. So i went to another ENT since first was not very helpful. He said he doesnt see anything on MRI and it cant be air trapped but is congestion but i asked today if was congestion would it not show up on the CT scan or MRI but instead all you see is air? Today he said it was fine and everything was free. So i am very confused and can not get an answer from anyone to what is causing headaches. I have tried Botox, Nerve Meds, and take a shot to prevent Migraines which has not worked either.I am going to 3rd ENT at Emory in Atlanta hopefully for some answers because it is driving me crazy. I thought i was going nuts from this and has cause bad anxiety and concentration issue along with some other.Does anyone have any input on what this could be? I dont know what to think when my Neurologist says its ""trapped"" air putting pressure and the ENT i just went to says its not? He first said it was congestion but you can only see air in the MRI which clearly shows the sinus and bump in that area where i am only getting the headaches.These show the bad side with bump"

Any advice will be great thanks."
Headache,I would be grateful to receive anyone's advice and opinion about my condition!please.,"This post is going to be a bit longer and i would be grateful for anyone who would take some time and read it.My whole story and history of this is not really short,i've had some similar issues 5 years ago but i don't think they are related because for 3 years i have been healthy and had no symptoms at all.Anyhow i will take some time and write that too because it could be useful to know.5 years ago:When i was straining myself in order to compete with my friends in a silly game i almost lost my consciousness,it was a nasty feeling that lasted for a couple of minutes(my motor functions were poor,my cognitive abilities, the feeling of derealisation was immensely strong and i could barely move my hands in the first minute).Fortunately it didn't last long and it went away soon after,i refused to say that to anyone and simply forgot that.Everything was fine for 1 year and i had no problems whatsoever.Then,in the pool,when i was diving and holding my breath a little longer i was again hit with that spooky derealisation feeling(the feeling of detachment from reality) as well as concentration impairment,only this time that wasn't strong but it lasted longer.I ended up in hospital for a couple of days and they did a lot of tests including MRI scan,EEG,general blood tests etc..everything was perfectly fine.I went home after that and my symptoms vanished,and for 3 years after that i felt perfectly normal.In the meantime i got some new issues like allergies although i don't see how can that be related.I also had some weird problems like chronic fatigue and i've been avoiding physical activity for 2 reasons:1.allergies(when i trained my whole body was red,it looked ugly and i felt really itchy)2.When i got really exhausted and tired from physical activity i would become really really dizzy and imbalanced,the feeling is horrible(just like the first time my motor functions were decreased and i had to lay down for a while to recover.I didn't tell this to anyone and of course i continued my life with constant worry and stress.February 14,2018My constant worry and stress culminated into the thought i have a cancer.I told everyone,including my parents and i fell into depression.During that terrible period my derealisation reappeared and it persisted for a long time,i had a weird feeling and sensations in my head(it's hard to explain),i was spending days in my house feeling so sick and helpless etc..Again we searched medical help and i did following:general blood test,ultrasound of liver and internal organs,checked thyroid gland..everything was fine..iron in my blood was on maximum.My last visit was to a very experienced general diagnoser who came up with a different explanation :There is nothing wrong with me,i am perfectly healthy,the reason why this is happening to me is because of the flaring of the nervous system in puberty as well as some bad habits in my life accompanied with stress.He gave me complex B vitamin as well as some advices and told me to go home,it will pass.And really after that i felt better but it still seemed like part of it never went away.2 months later:i don't know how and i don't know why..it is all extremely vague to me but that weird feeling in my head accompanied with head pressure,derealisation,brain fog and similar was appearing more often and it seemed like some of my symptoms would appear and disappear while some would remain all the time and it is extremely difficult to explain that feeling like something is wrong with your head.I requested some more research and in that period we have visited 2 neurologists and 1 psychologist.I also did EEG again,doppler ultrasound of blood vessels in my head,checked my ears..everything was fine.1st neurologist sent me to a psychologist who then diagnosed me with anxiety,it appears anxiety is the big bad wolf.I have to admit ever since February i have been in the claws of stress,anxiety and depression.I fell into conversation with her asking how can such a huge spectrum of physical symptoms be triggered by anxiety.She said that i can and also mentioned a couple of other causes which themselves can cause symptoms as well as anxiety resulting in worrying about them:My overthinking,relying too much on the intellectual side,emotional immaturity and similar..And yes that all stands:i really have a tendency to think constantly and overwhelm my brain.She said it could be all be like a loop.After saying my symptoms 2nd neurologist's reaction and overview was pretty similar.In a nutshell everyone around me as well as doctors i've visited said that i shouldn't be worried it's all due to anxiety,overthinking,bad habits etc..And honestly i don't know,now i've managed to reduce my anxiety but the symptoms are still very real.I forgot to mention that my handwriting got worse this year and the reason why i'm posting it here in this group is because ever since i know about myself i had problems with headaches,and they are still here,can get more frequent,can be rare(depends on the period).I've posted this on other group but i'm posting it here because this is ruining my life.With headaches i also used to have nausea and dizziness.Forgot to mention:I wanted to do MRI again and they all said they think there is no need but i can if i want to and now i'm waiting for it,as well as doppler ultrasound of blood vessels in neck and i should also request to get tested for lyme disease,it appears i'm the only one willing to do something about thisAs much as i want to believe that doctors are right about this it still feels like there is a physical problem.My symptoms now didn't get away and despite my control over anxiety i am still struggling mightily to find relief and get rid of this state.My current symptoms are:brain fog,derealisation,poor memory,poor concentration,cognitive abilities impaired,brain zaps during day(can be frequent,can be rare),on some days head pressure and sensations are stronger and along with brain zaps it is really frightening,headaches(different types including ice pick headaches).As i said my anxiety is mostly under control but subconscious worry remained ever since this all started.I really need advices and opinions and i would appreciate them much because i have issues with learning,reading and thinking in general.I am 17,caucasian male,going to middle school,1,85 cm tall and about 77 kg weight."
Headache,"Chronic Headache for 4 months, 24/7 - Desperate","Hoping for any advice at all regarding my unusual chronic headache. I have had a chronic headache for 4 months. Its characteristics:-Came on gradually over the course of a week- Unilateral (L side), primarily in temple, but shooting through left eye, sinus and teeth - Constant. The pain has not gone away or moved for even a few minutes within 4 months- Spikes. Always at a level 3-4/10, with intermittent periods of pain at levels 7-8. Spikes of pain last a few hours, and seem concentrated within a few days. I.e., pain will be at a 4 for a week, and then will be up to an 8 for several days in a row.- Not associated with nausea, light/sound sensitivity, auras, or other migraine symptoms My medical history: 27-yr old female with overall good health but some emotional issues. Currently on Wellbutrin for depression, Lamictal for mood swings, Xanax as needed for panic attacks, and birth control (Yaz). Mental health well-managed with therapy and drugs. History of B12 deficiency that has been resolved. No history of headache.The pain has been completely unresponsive to all analgesics. No medicine has caused even slight relief. Have been given:-NSAIDS: aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, indomethacin, nabumetone, diclofenac (Cambia)-Triptans: sumatriptan, relpax-Barbiturates: Fiorinal-Muscle relaxants: cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril) -Acupuncture and pain-relief meditation exercisesAs no medicine has broken the headache cycle, preventative headache medicines have been limited. Took Topirimate (Topamax) for one month, discontinued due to lack of response and side effects (breakthrough bleeding due to reaction with birth control pill). Last night I began taking Nortriptyline.Diagnostic tests / conditions that have been ruled out:- MRI with and without contrast (normal)- MRV without contrast (normal - no thrombosis)- Endoscopy of sinuses (normal)- Tooth examination, dental X-rays (normal)- Chiropractic exam (normal)- Tooth grinding: my teeth showed signs of mild grinding, I have been given a night-guard for 3 months, with no relief; not TMJ- Nerve function tests / electromyography (normal)No patterns have been identified to cause headache: - Stress or anxiety (headache still killer when relaxed, including with Xanax)- Foods (no food, alcohol identified to trigger headache)- Hormones/specific times of month (no change)- Weekdays vs weekends (no change)- Location (have travelled with headache for 2 weeks at time, with no change, so likely not environmental)- Medicine (was taken off birth control for a few weeks with no change; ditto with Wellbutrin; have not been taken off Lamictal as it is not known to cause headache)- Medicine withdrawal (as no analgesic has been taken regularly)- Major life change (nothing happened in August to trigger headache)- Sleep patterns (headache is the same with both more and less sleep)- Exercise (no change w and w/o exercise)- Time of day (headache present upon waking, throughout day, in evenings, at bedtime, when waking in middle of night)Therapist and psychiatrist do not suspect psychosomatic pain, due to persistence, lack of emotional triggers, and lack of response to any treatment (even placebo effect).Access to excellent healthcare, currently seeing excellent neurologist biweekly. Have sought 2nd opinions. She was optimistic that this was Hemicrania Continua, but the headache was unresponsive to indomethican (50 and 100mg).Right now my only diagnosis is ""persistent headache."" Doctor's current proposed next steps:- Steroids (prednisone for a week in hopes of breaking headache cycle)-Continued diagnostics (MRA of brain to look for possible aneurysm - Elimination diet (i.e. diet cutting wheat, processed foods, dairy, etc and then slowly adding them back)Please - do you have any other ideas about possible medicines, triggers, diagnoses, tests? I am missing work and social obligations due to this headache and doctor appointments. It's really harming my quality of life."
Headache,Scared of anyrusm!!,"I have an INTENSE headache that woke me up in the middle of the night. I have had 2 ct scans without contrast in the last 2 months, because of something else. do you think if I had an anyrusm, it would have shown up then??? also I check my pupils and its scary because theyre normal but when I look in the mirror, they are constantly changing in size!! please help"
Headache,Tension headache and lightheadedness,"I get mild tension headaches, these tensions are felt behind my eyes ears and nose.Touching something, walking causes tension there, especially if I focus too much.Stiffness in my back also causes me tension.Staying somewhere warm like an office, going to a shop, driving with the windows closed, I feel like holding my head because of the pressure and tension that increases my anxiety, even on a computer or playing a videogame.I have mild pressure in my ear, if it itchess or goes heavy, it increases the tension in my head.Yesterday, I felt lightheaded I thought I was going to faint, there was ringing in my head. The nerves and tinging in my head lasts for a few seconds, then moves down to my feet.Today I feel fine. Just a mild tension headache.I take ibrupofen, but it don't work."
Headache,"Headaches every day from car accident 1.5 years ago , help ","i was in car accident in march 2017, had concussion , i was off for a year from work due to car accident because i had a hip replacement from the accident as well. i went back to work and noticed that my headaches, neck pain has gotten so much work, i even cut my hours at work for a few months. however, its debilitating . i am exhausted from constant pain, i have been and continue to go to physio. i have had massage, movements to my neck, shockwave therapy and needling and nothing has helped. why doesnt my doctor think a referral to neurologist is not appropriate. i take 2 tylenol 3's at a time at work even and no relief. any advice would be greatly appreciated!! I am 53 and have years until i can retire. i am losing hope"
Headache,Headache for more then 2 months,"I immediately apologize for my English because it's not my first language. I'm about 18 years old. I have more than 2 months of headache that does not stop. It started from nowhere. In the first weeks it seemed that it hurt my whole head, but now, most of the pain is in the back, maybe even in the upper head side, and now this pain is accompanied by short but very sharp pains. The headache starts as soon as I get up, it passes through the day, but returns. There were weeks when I did not feel anything at all, but the pain always came back. Very often headache is accompanied by nausea, there is some kind of strange sight, but rarely, I feel some strange feeling behind nose, it's hard to explain it. I went to the neurologist, he diagnosed tension headaches, but I don't feel that is a tension headache, is probably something worsen. I also went to the eye doctor, and they are also healthy. I'm very afraid that there may be brain cancer or a tumor, because such a pain that does not go away is very worrying. Please share your experience who has experienced or advised what to do because I'm out of my mind ?"
Headache,"On and off headache, head feels heavy, brain fog. Help! ","Hi everyone,This is my first post to this site but I have been looking at posts on this website for quite some time now and decided to join to see if anyone could please, please help me.A little backstory to me, I am 20 years old, 5’1, 180 pounds (please no judgement) About a few weeks ago, I noticed I became more tired than my normal always tired and I had this very strange sensation in my head. Nothing is spinning around me and I never fall but i feel that sometimes I am going to. This has been accompanied by a headache that can get very strong from time to time but a lot of time it is very dull. I seem to go to bed and wake up with the same headache. The feeling of pressure (I think you could call it pressure?) is driving me insane. Not only have I had low energy but this feeling in my head is making it so hard to go through everyday. I feel so off, my head is always hurting. I feel off balance. And my head feels foggy. I’d like to say my short term memory is a little off as well. I will go into rooms sometimes and forget what I am doing, also I will close out of apps on my phone to do something else which is when I forget what I even closed out of the app for. It is every single day this awful feeling in my head. I went to my PCP out of frustration, only for him to tell me he has no idea only maybe and to see a neurologist. I have a neurologist appointment in over a month and I can’t get one any sooner. I am afraid to go back to my PCP out of embarrassment but I am so uncomfortable. The PCP thought it was anxiety or a tension headache. I have a hard time explaining what I am feeling in my head. I like to say it’s a dull headache that gets worse at times with a feeling off off balance and pressure. I also experience more ringing in my ears than I have before. I see a hematologist regularly to assess my vitamin b12 (since that became oddly LOW for no reason over a year ago) and I’ve been receiving b12 shots every month since then. My b12 has been at a slow, slow increase. It rose from 250-650 in a year and a half despite me getting b12 shots every 2 weeks to a month. Last b12 reading was at 650 in May. I have no idea what is wrong with me. I feel off all the time. My family seems to blame it on my anxiety about it. But I really don’t believe that at all, I spend most of my days not really thinking about it but always feeling it. I also am anemic which was controlled by iron supplements that I take every night (last iron reading was 59 in January) If anyone has any ideas of what I should ask my hematologist I appreciate it. I have no idea what is wrong with me but I know deep down something is wrong with my head. Thank you in advance."

Headache,Depressed and anxious I can’t cope anymore,"My anxiety has got the better of me. I have been suffering from headaches for over a year now, been referred to a neurologist and had an mri scan, apart from fluid in my mastiods my doctor isnt worried. I am 99% sure that my anxiety is causing all this, i have a sore neck all the time and this evening i have found a little bump right at the bottom of my skull on my right side that was sore, and i pressed it hard to try and massage it and it disappeared and now i am scared i have done something terrible and made things worse. My anxiety is ruining my life now, i have tried counselling and meds but my mind is more powerful. I dont want to see anyone, or go out and im only 25. Can anyone reassure me i havent done something to make my headaches worse or damaged myself?! I feel like i cant cope anymore ?"
Headache,I feel a bump/ridge on top left side of head above scalp line. Should I be worried?," I'm 22 years old and the last time I really had a major head impact was maybe months ago back in September but I felt fine afterwards and days later. It feels like there is like a bump or ridge on the top left side of my head just above the scalp line. I am worried that this is an enlarged artery or something serious. I can kind of feel it at the same point on the other side of the head but it isn't as bad or large as on the left side.is this normal? It doesn't hurt to the touch but again it just doesn't feel right to me at all. Sometimes I do get migraine headaches but idk if that's due to light sensitivity or looking at a screen for long periods of time. Sometimes when I'm sitting down at work, and suddenly stand up and stretch, I also get a sudden head rush and sometimes I feel light headed but when I lean over, everything goes back to normal. Again idk if light sensitivity has to do with it but it's an odd symptom. I also have recently been diagnosed with a deviated septum along with polyps and blockage in the nose. As well as a enlarged lymph node of the left side of my neck that I had for a while (shrinking now though) could these factors be the cause of what is going on on the left side of my head? I've been trying to get an answer for this on here and no response. A response would be appreciated to ease my stress about this.

Headache,Headaches spreading to gum/teeth,"Hi, I've had 'daily/chronic headache syndrome' for about 2 years now but in the past month I have started to feel the headache in my gums, particularly around my two front teeth area. Sometimes I can feel it in my nose too.My teeth and dental health are fine, I had a routine dental appointment 2 months ago.I've been on Amitriptine for around 1 year for my D/CHS, which had reduced my headaches a lot but completely.Any ideas as to why I am starting to feel the headaches in my gums would be great, please! Can't seem to find anything on google ?"
Headache,"Tension headache in the morning, worsens with exercise and sleeping long?","I’ve been having pounding morning headaches for a long time. I have a history of neck and back problems, so I’ve always believed it’s caused by my tight neck. On those mornings that my tension headache is worse, I also have a really tense feeling in my neck (often with a lot of crunchy sounds when I move my head). Normally the headache disappears within 20 min of getting up.Anyway, I’ve been doing stretches, changing my sleeping positions and pillows but none of that seems to help. I have two distinct observations I haven’t found an explanation to yet:If I sleep less than 6 hours I hardly have any headache when I get up. The longer I sleep the stronger the headache is.Exercise clearly seems to worsen the morning headache. I have never heard of this before, but when I start going to the gym and swimming daily, I feel much more headache and dizziness when I wake up.So what I would like to know is that are my symptoms normal for a morning tension headache cause by tight neck muscles and does it make sense that it worsens with regular exercise and sleeping longer? Also I would like to know what I could do next to fix the problem? I have been to doctors and physiotherapists many times about my back and neck problems. From what I remember they just advised me to stretch more and keep moving, but clearly that’s not making the condition any better.Thanks!"
Headache,I have had a headache for nearly 2 years and my doctors don't know what it is. Can anybody help me?,"Problem:I’ve had this headache that started on December 6, 2016, and has not gone away.Background:-I was 13 at the onset of the pain and I am now 15-I am a female-It first started when I went back to dance for the first time after a 3 week break-I’ve had a history of headaches and migraines with aura before-I have a history of General Anxiety Disorder and a therapist once told me I likely had clinical depression-I had a concussion on March 3rd, 2018 which made things worse-I have a 504 in school nowSymptoms:-Located at my right temple-I did not see my normal aura this time, however, there are times where my vision gets black around the edges-The pain ranges from a 2/10-9/10-Stress makes it worse-Sometimes I’ll have another headache on top of my persistent one (a sinus headache or tension at other parts of my head)-I have severe nausea but never any vomiting.-I often have to take breaks in school-Sometimes when the pain is bad it makes me unable to read or focus-The concussion did not add any new symptoms, but it did make all my previous ones worse for about a month (nausea, headache, confusion, lightheadedness, memory loss)Treatments and Tests:-I’ve tried Reglan, amitriptyline, naproxen, steroids, Periactin, Topamax, Excedrin, Advil, Sudafed, Aleve, Tylenol, and prednisone. (not in that order)-The only medication that has ever made it go away was the first round of steroids that I took about three weeks after the start of the pain-As soon as I was off the steroids, the pain came back.-Since the start of the headache, I have seen two neurologists, two therapists, an occupational therapist, two pediatricians, three ophthalmologists, been to patient first twice, and I even was in the ER once.-Doctors have said the pain seems like a cluster headache but i have no other symptoms of them-I have had an MRI scan and a CT with contrast in December 2016 and both were clear-I had blood tests done and nothing of concern came up-At my first pediatrician visit for the pain, the viewing of my optic nerve looked to be concerning, but when I went to an ophthalmologist they said the only issue was that I needed glasses (which I already had for about 5 years prior)My current diagnosis is migraine with aura and status migrainosus, non intractableMy doctors can see why it started, but nobody can figure out why the pain has lasted for so long. Any ideas would help me at least find something to bring up at my next doctor visit. "
Headache,Headache for almost a month,"Ok so i’m 17 years old and i have had a headache for almost a month. there have been a few days where i have had no pain, some days a bit more pain than others but it is never really severe pain. Just at that annoying point. i don’t know if it will fix itself or not"
Headache,"Left side head pressure, tender spot, neck issues","Hello, I am new here but I am a little concerned. I am a healthy 35yr old male however I have been dealing with left side head pressure for the last 5 weeks. I don't get a real bad headache but its mostly just pressure and its pretty much with me 24/7. I have noticed when I lay down or go to the gym with my headphones on it is not as bad but always there, I seem to feel it more when standing but again its always there even when sitting at my desk at work. I will list a few of my symptoms below in a moment but I did want to mention the last 2 years have been rough after going through a tough separation with my fiancée and only seeing my son a couple days a week instead of daily so my stress and anxiety was really bad for a while however I am dealing with that better now so I have a hard time believing this is stress related. I am a very anxious person and do not do well at the doctors, my blood pressure and heart rate go through the roof even just at a check up.The last few months I have not felt like myself, I have had a bad stomach my whole life but it got worse around November 2015 and I was having chest pains and tightness, long story short I saw my doctor multiple times and was diagnosed with GERD and I also had an EKG and Stress Test Echo on my heart which all came out fine thank god. Now a couple months later I was finally feeling a little better, chest issues and stomach still kind of there but no where near as bad and then randomly get hit with this head pressure one Sunday night after just laying on my couch. I went to the doctor after 2 weeks of the head pressure and he tried 2 weeks of muscle relaxers thinking it was my neck, my neck is super tight especially left side where the head pressure is and he told me to stop going to the chiropractor. I was going to the chiropractor for just a couple months before all this happened because my neck and left shoulder always hurt (I work out in the gym and think part of it is from that, I used to lift very heavy but I don't as much anymore). The funny thing is a week before this head pressure started my chiropractor did his usual neck crack on both sides and I remember it almost hurting, feeling different then normal and sent pain through my head. I honestly wonder if he did something to me and if this is from my neck however almost 6 weeks and still feel the same? Advil doesn't do much, muscle relaxers didn't work. I am doing neck stretches and just bought a hand held massager this past week for my neck and head. My doctor did not think brain tumor at my visit based of my symptoms and said my reflexes were good. Sorry for the long post but hoping for some help, my doctor is now referring me to a neurologist but I am trying to hard to push it off a little more hoping it gets better, I have enough medical bills and I am trying to tell myself this has to be from my neck or something that will heal eventually. I know brain tumors are pretty rare but of course I am having anxiety over that.Symptoms:-left side head pressure 24/7.-some pressure in left eye and ear but not terrible.-neck issues, especially left side, recently got a massage and the massage therapist said my upper back and neck were extremely tight. Chiropractor although I haven't been in a few weeks doctors orders said my C-1 or 2 joint cant remember which one was out of place. I have been doing neck stretches and using a tennis ball.-some lightheadedness and fatigue, nothing crazy and could be stress since I think about this and worry all day.-just noticed this week I have a tender spot on the bone top left back side of head.-no weight loss, no fever, appetite ok for the most part, stomach ache some days but no vomiting. I do get a little bit of facial tingles in the left side of my cheek and especially my chin, it is not constant and comes and goes. This did start a couple months before this and I went to the dentist because I still have 3 of my wisdom teeth. He did say they could come out and my bottom right one was coming in a little crooked and could be causing some pressure. He did I could hold off for a bit and it wasnt an emergency and that could be causing some of my chin numbness and tingles. Also I am constantly popping my ears because they feel a little blocked and my nose feels a little congested but this has been going on for a while and is not something new, maybe allergiesHopefully some suggestions and feedback will help, I will see neurologist if this doesn't improve but again I am trying to wait just a little longer on that."
Headache,temple pain! worried sick :(,"i didnt really know where to post this, i suffer with anxiety that mainly targets my health. all day ive had on and off pain in my left temple. after trying to figure out what triggers is, ive realised its hurting mainly when i tense my tongue or my jaw. im worried sick that something is really wrong. ive suffered with my jaw before,with it clicking, being stiff etc but ive never experienced this before. ive been looking at a screen up close for a few days but i dont think its that due to it only being there when i tense my tongue or jaw. its really worrying me, ive got some morphine that i was given a couple weeks back after my laparoscopy and im considering just taking some so i can sleep and not be in pain. any help would be really appreciated thank you"
Headache,Headache or irritation in back right side?,"So recently or for a few weeks I guess I’ve just had minor headaches or irritation or straining in the back of my head, I don’t drink as much water as I should but also have been having a lot of back pain too and wondering if back pain could contribute to that pain I’m feeling in the back of my head, I was stressing all day thinking I have a brain aneurism, or a tumor or something serious, because I can’t seem to figure it out, I know a lot of people deal with migraine or headache problems like this and have had them for months but would like to get a little insight or some closure on this experience I’m feeling, thanks."

Headache,Worried,"Sorry, I know we are all worried which is why we are here but I truly would welcome your thoughts and guidance.I have over the past 4 weeks had a constant discomfort in my head, right side behind ear about 2-3"" in. It also appears downwards towards my neck and in my neck and upwards to top of my head and forehead. Not behind eye. Into ear. / cheekbone As the day progresses I feel like I am getting warm, not hot, no temperature that I am aware of but haven't got a thermometer!This isn't new. I have had the discomfort that appears behind my ear and into the head in a straight line for years, but just occurring here and there and generally worn off by mid afternoon. This time though it is the one thing I can be assured of daily, and it is still there when I go to bed. I have occasionally had, again over the years, like a sensation of pin prickling to my scalp and face, no rash ever appearing and lasting for a day or two.I have never seen my GP about this but did make an online appointment for tomorrow - but when I went on to check the time no appointment for me!! So I have now made another appointment for next Saturday which is the earliest I can get.Has anybody any ideas of what this is please? As the days go by I am getting more worried.Thank you"
Headache,Chest pressure followed by head pressure...,"Hello this is my first time using these forums, i'm desperate for some help.Im 25 male. About 2 weeks ago i started noticing strange feeling in my body, discomforts and occasional sharp pains. It has got progressivly worse but now there seams to be a pattern. It starts with i tight pain in my chest on the left side, over time it moves to my back under my left shoulder, then to between my shoulder blades. Finaly i get a pressure in my head followed by tingling lips and tounge with a horrible sensation all down the front of my body that last for a long time.I've been to A&E a couple times thinking im having a heart attack but they have never found anything wrong with me. I've had a blood test, multiple ECG's, blood pressure tests, chest x-ray, everything always comes back normal.My GP diagnosed Anxiety and prescribed Propanolol, but i know its definately not anxiety. I'm gonna try and push for an MRI scan if i can but i really worried.Besides that i get random short pains in my hands and legs, i'm thisty all the time, lost my appitite.Does anyone have a clue what this could possibley be?"
Headache,Seeking help for my 22 year old son,"Hi I am desperately seeking help for my 22 year old son who has suffered from a almost constant headache since he was able 14. I have taken him to doctors, gotten MRI’s and he’s been in severally different medications. He now a junior in college and these headaches are affecting him so badly he wants to just give up. I have taken him before to see a therapist but because he is now over 18 I can’t force the issue. I have tried to go into his Drs appointments with him but he doesn’t want me there. My thinking is as his mom I could be more forceful on finding out what is causing this. He has been told that some people just have a constant headache and there’s nothing physically wrong with them, they just have the headaches. They deal with it. I am afraid for him because they are wearing him down and his life is just beginning. Is there anyone out there that can relate to what he is going through? Does anyone have any suggestions on what type of questions or comments that he can ask his Dr to better relay his frustration. He has been given pain medication in the past but it’s something that I give to him. The last thing I need is him addicted to them. He does get relief but it’s very brief. I am getting just a frustrated as a mother because I can’t help him and he doesn’t know how to help himself. So please agin if anyone can relate or give suggestions on how to help I would appreciate it. He has a bright future ahead of him if we can get these headaches under control. "
Headache,"Constant head pressure, spaced out, dizzy feeling for 4 months ","I am only 20. It all started the beginning of May. I am a server and was busy at work and needed something quick to drink. I grabbed a Pepsi. I took a few sips, sat it down. I began to feel very dizzy and like I was about to pass out. I thought I was having some sort of anxiety or panic attack. My vision was very blurred and disoriented. Fast forward a week and I’m still feeling the same. Pounding headache and the same vision issues. I go into the ER because I couldn’t take it anymore and got a ct scan done. I was afraid that it was something serious. It’s domething I wake up and go to bed with every day and night. Everything came back clear. So I go about living my life miserabley the next few weeks assuming it might be just allergies or something. It still never goes away so I start seeing my doctor. He tells me it’s probably just migraines so he puts me on topamax, which made my symptoms worsen. I got off of it and started taking proponoral. That didn’t do much of anything either. Fast forward another few weeks. I am still feeling the very same. I still have that pounding headache that I wake up with and go to bed with every night. I went to the ER and they gave me a muscle relaxer. I take it and it woke up with my headache completely gone. Although I am still experiencing the same vision issues. My headache becomes very on and off instead of constant. My doctor suggested that I get an MRI so I go and do so and it came back clear. All good. My chronic headache disappears a couple weeks after that and it’s more of a constant pressure around my head now with the dizzy/foggy brained eyesight. I recently had an eye exam done and that was all good as well. I have been living like this for 4 months with no answers and I just can’t do it anymore. I am very unmotivated and my family and boyfriend see that. Any suggestions?"
Headache,Temple pain,Hi everyone. Anybody else have that hurt to touch pain on their temple or side of their eye after or during a migrane? Also any recommendations for migraines to calm down? Thanks! 
Headache,Weird vision and headaches?,"So recently I noticed while at work I’m my vision would get really weird like as if I had an adrenaline rush, and I thought noting of it because I didn’t eat much and was doing a lot of lifting and when I get home I get the same vision problem, and Ill notice these feelings in my head not necessarily a headache but I feel the irritation so I don’t know what to call it, I’m just nervous I may have a tumor sometimes I get light headed, I don’t really keep up with my water intake but this is a recent problem and was wondering what could be the cause? I’m 18 years old and in shape for the most part I do eat unhealthy quite a bit to be honest, and the noticeable feelings in my head are the back left part or right, and sometimes my eyes feel strained too, if anybody could give some advice that’d be great thank you for your time."
Headache,Headache and pain in eyelids for over 2 months,"Hello,I have been getting headaches and eye discomfort everyday for nearly 2 months. It is localized in my eyebrows (mostly in the center near nose) and pain in what feels like my eyelids. For the most part I feel fine and I am able to workout and tend to my daily activities. Out of concern, I went to the ER and they preformed a CT scan of my brain and thank goodness they found nothing serious. They told me to see a neurologist and to take Advil 3 times per day which hasnt helped at all. I need to wait 4 weeks to see the neuroligist but i am feeling more and more anxious with each passing day because i have no clue what the source of these headaches are...I am starting a new job in less than 2 weeks and desperatley need some help to figure out whats going on. Any and all help would be greatly appreciated. D."
Headache,Constant headaches all over head.,"Can anyone please shed any light on my problem. I have had headaches for years now, but for the past couple of years i also have the sensation of split second buzzing in my head . Like tiny electric shocks.

I've had enough of it now so i wondered if anyone on here could help. Doctors are no help . They just want to talk you out of thinking there may be something wrong so they don't have to refer you anywhere else. Any help would be appreciated.

Headache,Occipital Neuralgia or Cluster Headaches?,"In March 2017, 5 days after I got married - I went to urgent care and the E.R. from that day onto repetitive days over the course of a month or so but abnormal dizzy spells along with random spouts of slight numbness to other odd symptoms. These symptoms made me more stressed than previous stress I had already had and I constantly felt uneasy thinking something serious was wrong with me (beginning of anxiety which I never had or knew I could get).Fast forward to May/June 2017 I started getting the most severe headaches I couldn't have ever imagined before having them. Half of my head (left side) would feel like it was about to explode and during so I would have excruciating pain behind the eye on that same side (left). As I recall, this pain would last anywhere between a couple minutes to 20 minutes. It was hard to properly time since they felt longer. I wouldn't be able to sit still through it calmly and would rock my body while sitting down along with moaning and/or crying over the pain at the same time. After this 'attack' like feeling was over my eye that was in pain would be a watery like it was crying way more than the other.I would get these 'attacks' once-several times a day unexpectedly and they would take over my life. I was diagnosed anxiety officially as well. I even had my first panic attack during this time period. I would constantly fear the next episode of 'attack' because they seemed so frequent. I spent time in between not wanting to leave my house because I was either too sensitive to the sunlight (and I love being outside and the sunlight) or because my fear/anxiety paralyzed me in a way to not partake in anything normal me would want to do. I was even on a break/disability from work because I was also getting my tonsils out during the time period. (which was another whole story and level of pain which was still more tolerable than these 'head attacks'. I of course would look everything up on the internet which led me to diagnose myself of having cluster headaches. Just like a zodiac sign and having anxiety along with this every symptom felt like it matched me to diagnose myself as that.Soon I would finally have a long awaited appt. to see a neurologist. (July 2017) She dismissed the idea of cluster headaches immediately without any further thought and went straight to diagnose me of having occipital neuralgia. She also prescribed me a low dosage of Nortriptyline (anti-depressant) to slightly increase throughout time for my nerves to 'calm down' and help alleviate the pain. I never increased it by much and stuck to the lower dosage because I dislike taking medication unless I really need it.I should also add that before these 'attacks' I already had severe neck pain that came throughout the day all days for the last couple years or so that I could remember. A chiropractor learned my history and linked it to a minor car accident I had when I was 16 or 'growing pains' or being a gymnast as a kid/teen. There were MRI tests of my head and neck that showed no signs of anything in my head other than a small pineal cyst which they said is not likely to be causing any symptoms nor is a sign of danger. The cervical MRI showed mild degenerative narrowing and 'dynamic anterolisthesis of C2 on C3'. With all of that info I was also prescribed to a few months (Aug 2017-October 2017) of PT which really brought attention how poor my posture is and where I carry my stress (neck). Around being 'diagnosed' with Occiptial Neuralgia and reading up about it, it gave me tons of relief anxiety wise and shedded off a lot of fear for other things. Also at the end of Aug 2017 I had quit one of two jobs I had that brought me TONS of stress. A job that I was told by many of my friends and my husband that I should let go and that the cons over-weighed the pros significantly. So between quitting my job, doing PT, taking the Nortriptyline, and letting go of most of my anxiety and fears through healthy and non-intense exercise and stretches and similar meditative ways, those ON 'flare-ups' dissipated immensely to where any flare up felt and currently feels more like a quicker zap and dull pain in my neck and back of the head (now right side) that was more manageable rather than what I would compare to the previous learned Cluster Headache. I also can see what the very similar symptoms that Occiptial Neuralgia flare ups and Cluster Headaches share. So along with all of this information, I may have improved lots mentally, emotionally, and physically. But the little thought of Cluster Headaches will still make me wonder if I was/am a contender for them and that I went on remission from them and if the doctor mis-diagnosed me. This feeds into a little bit of anxiety and minor flare-up pain.My questions for those who have either Occipital Neuralgia, Cluster Headaches, or a doctor/nurse/someone that has vast knowledge of them are..1) Could any of you relate to this story/head pain? 2)What are your thoughts? Mis-diagnosis? Is it possible to have ON and CH together?! I've read that those already both have slim statistics to have just the one. One of my theories was that my anxiety and symptoms of pain snowball-ed into one another to make things flare-up just to mock Cluster Headaches (fingers crossed that's the case). But I also do find when comparing the two that the more leaking eye after an episode is not common in ON and only in CH. Another thing I had was the restlessness during an episode that I only read information on the sort when it came to CH and not during an ON flare-up. When I read the stats of both cases my age/age of onset which was 29 and now I'm 30 going into 31 in a couple months which seemed more common for CH rather than ON. However, I don't qualify to fall in the larger ratio categories besides age to be commonly linked to it. -Never a smoker-Will drink occasionally only socially a beer or two if any, no hard alcohol-Not even close to being overweight, pretty active when healthy, etc.Sorry for the very long essay, I just wanted to fit every detail in and lately I've been starting to fear that I was misdiagnosed and that the CH will come back. Thanks for reading all of this! And I'm sorry to offend anyone that has either of the sort into self-diagnosing myself previously."
Headache,Constant headaches for 6 weeks,"Back in July, I remember taking a nap on a Saturday afternoon and waking up with a pretty bad headache originating from my neck on the left side and carrying over toward the front around the left eye.I've had these headaches ever since although none has been as bad as the first few days. The pain intensity comes and goes throughout the day but it is always there. Sometimes it will go away for a few minutes but sure enough it returns. Occasionally, I go with no pain for 1-2 hours or sometimes the pain and pressure around my nose and eyebrown is intense enough, keeping my eye open is a chore.A few days after onset, I went to a doctor and was prescribed steroids and a nasal steroid spray for seasonal allergies. They found irritation in the back of my throat and moisture build up in my ears and nose. This helped for a while but didn't cure it completely.Three days ago, I was prescribed 1000mg of amoxocilin, 2 x per day for a bacterial sinus infection. I havent really improved but I am hoping it may take effect by tomorrow.Usually an ibuprofen will take care of it for about 10-12 hours and it is like I never had anything to begin with. I try not to do this more than 3-4 times per week. While the intensity doesn't seem as bad, I am really bummed out and annoyed. I've made the mistake of googling remedies or for advice on what could help and of course now, I have some really unpleasant things present in my mind.I could take a sharpie and draw the pain route from the left side of my nose up below and above the eyebrow back to the left top/side of my head and down through the left part of the nape. Sometimes the pain seems to travel along this route and intensify in spots. I am just fed up with this pain. I want to focus on other things but now I am also scared. I am going to finish the antibiotics (cycle will be done Tuesday) and see where I go from there. Has this happened to anyone before? What was it? Any advice?"
Headache,Constant neck pain and tension headache,I’ve been having these tension headaches bad for the last few days but not doing anything different. I always grind my teeth which leads to headaches but lately it’s been literal neck pain radiating to my head and nothing seems to soothe it. Pain medicine doesn’t work hot or cold packs lying down. I wake up feeling okay but as the day goes by it gets worse and by 5pm I have to go home. 
Headache,Something weird,"Hi allRecently, whenever I stand up after sitting down for maybe 10 minutes or more or so I have this weird “swimmy” feeling where I feel dizzy and my head feels like it’s tightening up. It only lasts for like 10 seconds but I don’t know what it is. Do any of you?Thanks. "
Headache,Headache and pressure ,"For the last week now I’ve had this headache it started as a tingling sensation above my right eye then spread across my forehead and had stabbing pains behind my eye, now it has circulated to the back of my head mainly on the right side, and feels like I have pressure on that side and behind my right eye, and I get the odd stabbing pain above my eye, when I’m asleep I feel my head tingling and going tight I can’t get into the doctors for 3 weeks but I rung them and they told me to take painkillers every 2 hours which haven’t really shifted it, I’m worrying now that it’s a brain tumour or something like that, I go on holiday in 5 weeks and am worried I’m still going to have them then, can anyone help please?

Headache,"Help please! Strange headaches, very scared :(","Hi, I suffered from severe health anxiety since April, however once July hit I started to calm down. But I noticed I started getting headaches. It started with a dull pressing feeling on my upper left side of the head that would stay for a while and go away after a few hours. every so often the headache would travel into the back of my head and to my forehead at random. Suddenly this pressing headache stopped and now I just feel throbbing like quick pains in the right side of my head. it'll start on the top right side area of my head, then ill get quick sharp pains in my forehead, and more pains in the back of my head.I know this all sounds silly but the headaches seem to be getting a tad worse and I don't know what to do, could it be from my anxiety? I have a fear of brain cancer.... Last time I feared a cancer I got sharp pains in my chest but that has long stopped. if anyone could help me out that'd be great. Thank you! "

Headache,Cluster headaches,"Dear all,I have suffered headaches since I hit my 40's. I went to my then GP and he diagnosed that I was suffering from cluster headaches. They seemed to appear around my period either side of my period and they would effect one side of my head, including my eye and become so severe, I felt like I wanted to jump out of the window. I had a head scan the GP said just in case I had a tumour but it wasn't that. The headaches last for around 5 days at a time, it didn't matter what over the counter drugs I took they didn't work. The GP gave me what he called a stack of drugs but these made me feel sick so I stopped taking these. Since then (almost 10 years later) I have suffered these headaches on my own. The pain can increase severely at times and I now find that it is effected my mouth. I get my teeth checked regularly but they are fine. My mother used to suffer from cluster headaches when she was my age and I thought ok maybe in the future these will stop like hers did, in her mid to late 50's. Something for me to look forward to but then I remembered that my father was diagnosed with Trigeminal Neuralgia and is still taking Tegretol years and years later. I'm now concerned that this could end up being something I may start to endure.. God knows that sometimes I just feel so alone with this pain. No-one can see it and there really isn't anything anyone can do for me, is there? I really don't want to be taking hard pharma drugs and I try not to take too many headache pills as they don't shift it either. I just thought I would share my experience with you, fellow sufferers out there. I found this website by chance as I was looking up my fathers symptoms. "

Headache,"BRAIN FOG, FIGHT OR FLIGHT, VISUAL SNOW, CONFUSION","I'm a very athletic, healthy 32year old male who's always had a clean bill of health. Almost 2 years ago my entire life was changed when, as best I've determined, my chronic stresses multiplied and turned to a trauma that I just couldn't handle. I spent 2 months excessively partying along with being attacked by a girl I was dating's ex-boyfrined, along with a terrible living situation where I was kept up all hours of the night, along with chronic poverty and feeling like my life was an hour glass with just a few grains left. (I'm a struggling actor in LA)Certain symptoms started trickling in over a few week period until all the sudden, one day I looked around and realized my mind felt slower, foggier, and more jumbled than ever before. I then began to really evaluate myself and realized that my memory was terrible; I couldn't remember what days any events had happened (I.E. was it on Monday or Tuesday or the week before. What did I do on my 25th bday, or 26th? Was it 4 or 8 months ago I last visited home?)Like probably many reading this, I began to read every forum about brain fog. At the same time, I realized my vision was impaired. There seemed to be a visual/translucent snow effect filtering my vision between me and whatever I was looking at, and I suddenly became aware of floaters in my eyes that I never paid attention to. I now saw halos around lights, had light sensitivity, and moving specs of light all over my peripheral vision, particularly while looking towards the sky or a clear surface. It seemed that my brain had shorted a circuit and now my vision and perception of reality had changed for the worse.I felt disconnected from who I've always been. I now felt as if I was just observing the remains of my former life, instead of actually living life in the moment. I would look at my hands and feel disconnected. Things no longer felt real, it was like a terrible dream I couldn't wake up from. The fight-or-flight mode which is usually triggered by an immediate threat, I was now living in from the moment I'd wake up until the moment I'd go to sleep. I felt more aware of everything around me in a paranoid way, similar to what I imagine PTSD is like. Suddenly the world that I used to see as an overall happy place, now seemed threatening and dark. I've always been abnormally optimistic and positive, but people and society just seemed ominous and scary. Loud sounds bothered me and I couldn't help but be aware of conversations around me, particularly at a restaurant. Walking into a grocery store or athletic gym, it instantly got worse. I felt zoned out and I'd then get anxiety symptoms like flushing in my face and just wanting to leave wherever I was immediately.I also now had racing thoughts in my mind that would run from the moment I woke up until the moment I fell asleep. I would over-analyze everything. My mind ran fearful scenarios and ran all of my symptoms and changes over and over to the point where I couldn't even focus on a conversation because I was more focused on my inner critic who never shut up. I'd wonder if I seemed weird to other people and if they could tell I was ""off"". I'd even get paranoid and think what if something traumatic happened to me but no one told me (insane, I know!) But this was now my life. I couldn't focus during a conversation, I was too focused on trying to not look weird and I couldn't focus, I'd feel I was eye locked or zoned out, so I'd look around to break my stare. Also the God I've believed in and had a relationship my whole life with now felt distant or even non-existent. I questioned everything. I was never suicidal but I would pray that I either be healed or get eaten by a shark on my next surf session. I would also get paranoid that what if I would do something drastic, sorta like what if I would jump off a huge building. I would reason it out and realize I never would, but that was part of the paranoia that added to my inner chaos. Sometimes all I could do was curl up in bed and just mourn.Like most forums I've read, I went to a PCP and did my basic blood work. I've had high cholesterol for years, but otherwise all seemed normal. I started seeing a great therapist who instantly diagnosed me with generalized anxiety but not depression. I started 150mg Wellbutrin XL which I have now been on for 9 months. I have noticed benefits, particularly the lows started to feel less low, but my mind still seems to not process at the highest rate that it used to, like there's just a slight layer not firing as it once did. I easily SEE STARS now whether doing a handstand or standing up in general. This rarely ever happened before. I also even tonight felt a dull tingling in the center of my head while rock-climbing because I had some adrenaline going from climbing and I think it triggered a very slight anxiety.Everything felt dimmer than before and all I could do was hope and pray that the ""lights would come back on"" and things would look as they once did. I stopped drinking completely for 9 months and have barely drank in 2 years, minus a few special occasions. I haven't touched a recreational drug in 2 years, and never had minus that 2 month window. I became obsessed with self-help books, learning to get out of my thoughts and back into my body and heart. I would do hot yoga, and I began a meditation practice which I have now been doing for nearly 2 years. I've read many articles where everyone is so eager to vomit out all of their symptoms and tests they've done and doctors they've seen, because we all feel so desperate in dealing with this seemingly undiagnosable, untreatable suffering! But I want to now talk about THINGS I HAVE DONE THAT HAVE ABSOLUTELY, SUCCESSFULLY TREATED MYSELF:1. Wellbutrin XL was a success! My lows aren't nearly as low, and I will probably go off of it in 3 months when I reach a full year.2. Meditation has been such a saving grace to get me out of my thoughts and to remember how beautiful and precious the present moment is all around me. I feel so much more connected once again, and meditation's benefits continue to get greater and greater.3. A therapist was one of my best investments and has helped immensely. It's important to have a sounding board I can trust, so I can just shut up my paranoid side, and focus on controllable aspects of life.4. I worked a sales job for 1 year to get my finances a little more on track, and then it was a great decision to quit because the boss was extremely stress-driven and negative. I moved out of that crazy house just after my symptoms all started and I actively control my environments.5. I take every opportunity I can to find peace and reconnect with myself. Whether turning off my music in the car, treating angry drivers like a game to see how quickly I can release any frustration or attachment to them. I take moments to deep breathe constantly throughout the day.6. Getting back on a full-time workout routine has done wonders for me physically and more important, mentally! A lot of my confidence is back and I feel sharper and healthier inside and out. I didn't realize I was only working out about once a week during my chaos and I'm back to about 5-6 days a week! I had given up on myself and my dreams, and now I'm back baby! I see my value and I am proud to be me once again.7. I started taking Adrenal Support just over the counter ""Adrenal-T"" because I believe all this past trauma has pretty much shot my adrenals.I FEEL LIKE MYSELF AGAIN!!!! PRAISE GOD!I am in the best physical shape I've been in, in 2 years. I finally once again feel peace in my heart, and although I still have anxiety issues, I can have a peaceful resting state that was impossible for me, most of the last 2 years. My anxiety is SO much better than before! I used to not even be able to enjoy a meal publicly or pickup groceries, but I do all the time now without even thinking about it! My never-ending inner critic shuts up half-the-time now! I am much less in my head, and I have many conversations with people where I'm not even thinking about anything but the conversation. I still have my occasional sad day, where I focus on remaining symptoms or let anxiety get me frazzled, but most days I just feel an immense gratitude to my God who I now feel reconnected with and to myself who I am learning more and more how to love and put first, and I once again feel so hopeful about my future! Every day is a blessing, and when I start to feel overwhelmed and chaotic, I just know that I need to make time that evening to light a candle, meditate, read, pray, or even rest!To anyone reading this, I hope this post has helped you feel less alone and shown that even though our doctors and MRI's and CT Scans all seem to be inconclusive, there are definite ways to take action to HEAL YOURSELF. I had never felt more alone and isolated in my life. I truly believe this immense inner suffering wasn't for nothing, and I now feel my perspective is even better and deeper and healthier than it was before all this started. I had a lot of insecurities and issues that I wasn't aware of or would overlook, and I believe I will shake my remaining symptoms and that my best days are ahead. Things like my visual snow are still there when I focus on them, but many times I can go most of the day without thinking about it. Wishing you all peace and love. What a life "

Headache,"Headaches, head pressure, fatigue, confusion and more... Please help","I've been getting headaches for quite some time now every day, really painful in the front of my head under my eyebrows and behind the eyes, which my eyes also hurt if I move them. It's like there's this intense pressure in my head and it's horrible. Also I have always been sensitive to light but now it is unbearable, and I am a little bit short-sighted but my vision has gotten significantly worse. I find myself getting dizzy and feeling as if I am going to fall over, getting confused and disorientated every day, no concentration, and not being able to think of words that I want to say when I am speaking, it is getting my partner worried because I am acting weird. Now I am also struggling to recognise and spell words... I got top marks in English and I have never had a problem with my spelling so this is all very strange and scary.The fatigue is getting so unbearable I can't walk properly half the time and have to stay partially bent over, also to try and stop the dizziness. I find that I can't stay awake for a whole day and the exhaustion is so severe I'm having to rest so much of the time. I've had a feeling of fullness in my ears for a while now, they have been checked and there's no infection. I've also started getting really severe mood swings, and all the pain and exhaustion is really getting me down.I have tried sinus tablets for the headache and painkillers but nothing has seemed to work. I am a female who has just turned 22 and I can't take this any more, so any help would really be appreciated. "
Headache,Head injury advice needed,"HiA week ago I was bending down to pick something up at home, when I brought myself back up, I did it reasonably fast as if there was nothing around me. However, I ended up hitting the top of my head on a metal door handle (the door was shut so it stayed put and didn't move with my head)The pain was terrible, all across the top of my head, infact I cried. Later the top of my head was still feeling sore. However, I developed a pain around my eyes like sinusitis and a feeling of having a 5kg sack of potatos pushing down on my head. I just didn't feel too good, but thought it wasn't serious as just 'a small bump on the head'. My nose ran later, not sure if that's relevant.I was still feeling terrible in the evening, I'd taken some pain killers for the headaches. When I woke the next day I felt like I had the 5kg sack of potatos on my head again, only a bit more in the forehead this time, but still pushing down. I also had a feeling of pressure in my head. The headaches were still there. I even had a loud ringing in my ears(just the next day)As time went on I the soreness on the top of my head seemed to decrease, but I had pain in my temples, round my eyes/nose and at the back of my head. I had leg cramp in the night a couple of days after the bump.Then a couple of days later I had to take the bus to town, the bus braked hard to avoid a car at a roundabout. I was standing holding a vertical metal bar, thrown about a bit, had to use my arm/shoulder to protect my face from hittting the bar or perspex partition and the metal bar hit me in the chest. I was shaking when I got off the bus, but calmed down within an hour or so and although it wasn't very pleasant I didn't think too much about it. I had two sets of leg cramps that night (which i haven't had for years)The pain in my head continued a dull pain and heavy feeling all the time, with some sharp shooting pains from time to time. I started to realise that I was talking a bit slower than usual, felt thick headed, struggling at times to recall a word needed to complete a sentence and even having to make 3 attempts at saying a word. I felt disorientated, slow and a bit stupid. I also felt like I just wanted to stay in bed and had been feeling a bit sick the last couple of days.I had thought about seeing the doctor before, but felt silly about it, then when I tried to go, I arrived too late twice. Then when I finally went yesterday, my doc was away and I had to go elsewhere. I told the doc about what had happened. He took my blood pressure, looked at the top of my head and said he could not see any cut or bruise. He told me to keep taking paracetamol, then gave me some ibuprofen due to the fact that I had discomfort inmy neck and shoulder (which he assumed was from the bus incident) He then told me to go for a brain scan. I've also had a strange twitching in 2 or 3 of my fingers (the middle ones) on my right hand and a strange sensation.The dull sensation is still there in my head, last night I had a seriously painful shooting pain in my left temple, coupled with the feeling of something expanding like a vein or something (that's just what it felt like not saying that's actually what it was) I still just don't feel right.The thing is, I am now afraid to have the scan, I didn't realise that it involved injecting iodine into my vein nor that the scan can be the equivalent of upto a 1000 chest x-rays, that this type of scan causes cancer... I don't like the idea at all. Perhaps an MRI would be better? However, I've now been told that is like a high concentration of mobile phone, which is also not good. Is it worth having a scan after 1 or 2 weeks since the head injury? If so which is safest? Which is the best in my case? I'm already distresses by my symptoms, but the thought of the scan is just not helping. I'm lost. The top of my head is sore again today, temples hurting, sinus pain and it seems like I have a lump at the back/bottom of my skull, it doesn't hurt when I press it?Many Thanks."

Headache,"Constant Headache for over a week,..... Worried","Hello all! I am a 34 year old woman who has a history of severe headaches for about a month at a time and then they are gone for months. I also have anxiety which is just a match made in hell! So far I have managed to self diagnose myself with every thing you could imagine....Thanks google. My questions here is this. Anyone else have this going on? My headaches are Tension related, they vary in intensity, but never go all the way away. I wake up with them daily. I had a CT scan in 2015 and one in 2017 due to severe headaches, went to a doctor who did blood work and said it was B12 issues, took shots no help. I rarely get head ache issues but when I do they last for weeks. Oh, also I have a low grade fever, but no cough, no drainage, or congestion. I thought maybe sinius related but nothing else but sinus pressure there. I am confused and scared and feel like I am driving everyone around me crazy asking if this is normal or if anyone can relate. ......Anyone?"
Headache,Help with supposedly tension headache?,"Good morning all,For the past 3 weeks, I have been dealing with what the doctor says are Tension headaches after going on Friday. It feels like a band around my forehead and pressure building up inside. They haven't subsided at all and range on a scale from 3-8 out 10 during different times.No sleep changes (the headaches don't disturb sleep surprisingly), no eating habit changes. I mentioned how work has been getting crazy, i.e., working overnight, looking for a new job, etc. I mentioned not taking advil/excedrin/painkillers as I didn't want a rebound headache. She started me on 60mg Propranolol but i forgot to ask how long it'll take to go into effect.Anyone have any experience with this drug? I've been on it 4 days now and the headaches hasn't gone away. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks."
Headache,Strange Headache Pattern,"Greetings,I need some help or advice from you, kind people. Beginning Tuesday night, I began to experience a mild pain in my head at the top left located about where the ridge/suture connects the frontal plate with the parietal plate. The pain comes on suddenly and aches for 5-15 seconds before disappearing. I would rate this pain as a 4 or 5 out of 10. The strange part is that since then (Tuesday night), it has ached every 3 - 20 minutes in the same fashion...a random flash of pain and several minutes in between where I feel fine. A couple of times I’ve had a more intense pain (5-6) near the base of my skull where I think the spinal cord connects to the skull (since Tuesday).I went to sleep Tuesday night thinking rest would cure it. Instead, the pattern persisted all day Wednesday and all of today. So two nights of rest has been no help. I’ve also tried melatonin, Tylenol, and ibuprofen to no avail. Melatonin has shown to be useful in treating ice pick headaches according to my research, but no such luck (which makes me think this is not an ice pick headache, along with the relatively minor to moderate pain - I would not call it severe or debilitating). Any help would be infinitely appreciated; the headaches have induced a certain degree of anxiety which IS interfering with my quality of life. Thanks."
Headache,"Pressure headache four months straight, no break!","Hello! I'm at my wits end. I have felt consant pressure in my nose, cheeks, roof of mouth, forehead for the last 4 month. This has been a constant feeling without any break, however the pressure does range from easy to ignore to a major obstacle in my daily routine.I have seen doctors specializing in neurology and sinuses, as well as two different primary care physicians in order to remedy this. I have undergone two MRIs (brain, upper spine) and 1 CAT scan (sinuses). The neurologist did not see notice any abnormalities and diagnosed me with migraines. I was placed on amitriptyline for a month to no effect. I was then placed on topomax for a week before I had to halt taking it due to side effects. During this week I didn't feel any relief. I was also given imitrex, which still did nothing to help my situation. I cannot help but feel that if none of these medications didn't help then I may not be dealing with migraines. The ENT (for sinuses) noticed inflammation in the CAT scan, but was unsure if this was the cause for my constant pain. He recommended opening up my sinuses through surgery, but said that he was only 50% sure this would help me. The feeling of pressure increases drastically whenever I lay down to fall asleep. When I wake up, it seems to have completely disappeared for around 5 minutes until it returns for the rest of the day. Ibuprofen and acetaminophen do not seem to affect the feeling. I have halted my consumption of caffeine, I do not drink, and I do not smoke. I have a relatively healthy diet. My blood panels did not suggest a direction to go in either. I do not have a prior history of headaches, or any or health problems I need this to end. Any help is appreciated."
Headache,"Headache in right side of head, ringing ears, pressure in head and twitching","Since about a month before Christmas I have had a constant pain in the right side, top of my head, it's not quite like a headache, it's more just a dull ache that usually goes away if I take some painkillers.

Headache,"Severe head pressure, lighrheadedness/dizziness for more than a decade","Hello. I am new to this website and I am very concerned in regards to neurology. I am a 34 year old male dealing with the head pressure for at least 12 years(since I was in my early 20's). This all started way back in the summer of 2005 when I first noticed that I was experiencing fullness around my head, which later escalated into lightheadedness and the feeling of faint upon standing or walking. And then it reached at the point where I had a full-blown panic attack and was taken to the ER. While at the ER, I was given a CT scan, a blood test, and an X-Ray. All found nothing. The next day, I was prescribed with a benzodiazepine Clonazepam and then a few months later, got switched to Ativan(Lorazepam), to reduce both panic attacks and the head fullness/lightheadedness. These drugs are also treated for people who have seizure disorders. However, the next year, I experienced a severe side effect which also caused irritability, so I was then later weaned off of the drug. Also that same year, all of my head symptoms became worse where I have to use my walking stick to walk and was lying in bed for weeks. I, then started visiting neurologists out-of-state and was given a regular EEG, MRI, another EEG(which I had to stay at an out-of-town hospital for two days). Nothing out of the ordinary was found. With the same symptoms I am still experiencing throughout the next couple of years, I was then taken to two more neurologists in my area, in which he ordered another MRI and an EEG. Still, nothing. Then, I was seen by ANOTHER neurologist at a local hospital, and he said to me that I was suffering from episodic ataxia which caused the migraine, so he prescribed me with Acetazolamide in which I had to take as needed. Unfortunately, I had to stop taking this drug because it caused me to have a kidney stone on the right side of my abdomen. While taking Acetazolamide, all of the migraine related symptoms subsided a little bit, but not completely, so I would consider it only a ""temporarily relief"". After a somewhat lull in my brain activity since late last year(I only had one or two episodes that only last a few days), the symptoms returned, but this time it is more persistent than the past cycles I have experienced throughout the years. So here are the symptoms I am having:Head inflammationAll of my symptoms start with the pressure filling inside my head, itfeels like inside of my brain is full.It can also start with the feeling that my brain is soft or nearly empty.During a migrane, when the pressure is felt on my left or right side of the head,it can cause facial twitches on the affected side; when it migrates to opposite side, then all of the twitching can be felt on the same side. It can be felt as if someoneis squeezing the part of my brain.There will be migraine-related headache throughout my head or on either sides of the head.Each time there is a migraine-related pain on one side of the head, it can alsobe felt around the eye area on the affected side. It would range from moderateto severe(I often get migraine-related eye pain located on the left side). Thiscould last for hours.Vibration(better known as ""buzzing"" inside my head)A brief buzzing sensation is felt inside my head. The buzzing can be felt for like five seconds, thus making me lose balance while standing or sitting, similar to a person on a verge of collapsing. This can be triggered while sitting,standing, being in a very lit environment, eating around the dinner table, watching television(although not very close to the screen), working on the computer. Itcan often felt sometimes while lying down. The buzzing is first felt, even if I am totally symptom free. Dizziness/lightheadednessDuring the onset, I often felt lightheaded upon standing or walking, and itfeels like I am about to collapse. This always cause a loss of balance andwhen I have to roam around, I have to use a walking stick to keep me balanced.This symptom is more of a concern because I often lie in bed almost all day,lasting for a couple of days to more than a week as a result. Also I avoidedgoing out to public places(shopping, going to movies, etc.) during this episode.TremorsI often get head shakes or tremors during the time I have migraine-relatedsymptoms, lightheadedness or dizziness. Sometimes it can be felt on differentparts of my body such as my arms or legs.Memory lapsesI often experience forgetfulness, memory lapses, and confusion during the onset.NauseaDuring the migraine, I often have nausea.When I take antihistamines the night before bedtime, some of the symptomsabove subside the next day after I wake up, but not fully. For example, theday I have a severe headache, the next day after taking one tablet, theseverity of the headache lessens, and sometimes lightheadedness. The relief only lasts for one day before all the symptoms return. In addition, last year I had blood work to check on my histamine levels that may be causing my migraines and the same result as the other tests I have underwent: nothingAlso I have taken 1mg melatonin before bedtime to try to reduce the symptoms, but to no avail :-(. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. In conclusion, does anybody here experiencing the same exact symptoms I am currently having? I really need to get some answers here because what I am feeling right now is totally disrupting my life! I am mostly in bed for weeks now and felt isolated from my friends and family. I avoided going to public places(i.e., going to the movies, shopping, etc.) because of fear that I might pass out because of the lightheadedness. And also I am unable to exercise and do household chores. I have went to nearly dozen neurologists and underwent certain tests and they all came back NEGATIVE! I can't go on living like this!Please help me... "

Headache,"Traveling headache with pressure, mild, but constant (almost 2 weeks)","I just registered and wanted to post this, probably just for peace of mind at this point. I'm a 22-year old male with no major health problems as of my physical in September of 2017. Starting 2 weeks ago tomorrow, I've had a come-and-go headache with mild-moderate aching and pressure.It began in the back of my head and neck but has since hit each side of my head separately, both sides simultaneously, the top of my head, my temples, and my forehead. Like I mentioned previously, it is accompanied by occasional pressure in the back of the head/neck and forehead, but I've also experienced jaw and ear pain too. No fever. It hasn't affected my daily life at all except for the first time late last night when my left temple was throbbing before I went to sleep. Still pretty manageable pain, but definitely the worst so far. Today it is back to mild.I have a history of migraines and headaches, so I guess the fact that this is so unlike those is what's disconcerting to me. Honestly, the worst side effect is the anxiety I get from the constant ache. I'm usually pretty good at noticing triggers, but this is a whole different beast. Over the counter stuff works for a few hours, but I've been wary of taking it so frequently. I drink plenty of water, get plenty of sleep, and I don't think I'm really stressed or anything. I've had it when I wake-up and when I go to sleep but that's not always the case. It's very random. I've tried taking targeted medicine (like something specifically for sinus pain) and I still haven't really narrowed anything down.I'm 2 months into a 3-month gap between insurance (of course it happens now...) and I can't really afford to be doing most medical things, especially since I visited the dentist because of tooth and jaw pain only 2 1/2 weeks ago and my wallet is still hurting a little bit.This is my first time posting/talking about this, so I don't know what I'm leaving out or over-emphasizing. If anyone is going through something similar or has absolutely any advice it would be very much appreciated!"

So it started last month where I felt very dizzy out of no where and felt lightheaded and caused a panic attack which I do have anxiety disorder to let you know. And since then it would come from time to time but now throughout the day i would have long moments of just starring idk why but I just stare and can’t stop and I would always have head pressure like tension headache and I would get up I would get dizzy from sitting to standing. Now last night while I was falling asleep I saw like white flashes when I was about to close my eyes and it really scared me and has me worried I might get seizure from everything I’m feeling. I am 16 I don’t eat well because of anxiety and don’t drink water. Does this have anything to do with it. Someone please help me!!!!! I’m so scared!!!!!!

Headache,Head feels like its filled with smoke,"I've been having these weird headaches. I've had them before, about every other day, and lately, it's been happening every day. It doesn't always ache per say, but it feels like my head is filled with smoke to the point where I can almost smell it. When it does hurt, it's mostly on the left side of my head. No one smokes in the house, and it can happen anywhere, so I don't think it's from actual smoke. If I take any medicine, it might reduce any pain but usually not the smokiness. I can't really determine any triggers- I just wake up and soon, it happens. I've also had eye pain for a long time(not always with a headache, but usually), which happens practically every day, at least lately. I can't find a trigger for that either. In the past, I'd usually get a sore throat with these headaches, but nowadays I don't. I often get nausea too, and I've been having heartburn lately(I don't know if that's related. I've had chest pain before and basically determined it was heartburn). My grandma suggested maybe it's sinuses, but it was thinking it was happening too often to be that. Plus, people I've talked to haven't heard of a smoky headache. I haven't found anything online yet about one either. Has anyone else had this smoky feeling, and what did you do about it? If meds won't do it, I'll at least ask about it at my next checkup. I'm 18, by the way.I've been having these weird headaches. I've had them before, about every other day, and lately, it's been happening every day. It doesn't always ache per say, but it feels like my head is filled with smoke to the point where I can almost smell it. When it does hurt, it's mostly on the left side of my head.

Headache,Strange Headaches Lately,"For a couple of months I've been having weird headaches. About a month ago, they were small, minor pains located in isolated spots. They only endured for about 2-5 seconds and then went away for a few minutes. Each time the spot on my head changed.Now, my headaches are still short (2-5 seconds) and fairly minor in pain, however, they cause my temperature to spike. When I have my headache, my temperature feels intensely warmer and then slowly decreases until I have the next one. They continue every 10 or so minutes for an hour or few, but then they will stop for several hours as well. I'm not sure if it is something I should be worried about because I did have a bad car accident at the beginning of May. Although I was having more headaches than usual before the crash, I still worry that these might be linked to it. Anyone know what this might be?"
Headache,"Varying neurological, vestibular, and psychiatric symptoms that seem to stem from headache","I am a 25 male with no prior history of headaches or migraines. About a year ago (I can remember the exact day and what I was doing) I seemed to began having a daily tension-type headache with brain fog / loss of clarity, lightheadedness, and dizziness. As time went on the dynamic of the symptoms changed. Soon the 'headache' part became very mild or no headache at all and I had only vestibular symptoms - daily brain fog and aural fullness or clogged feeling in my ears, sensitivity to quick head movements and very occasional mild vertigo, earaches, and tinnitus.I was first told it was anxiety and was given a regime to keep my anxiety under control. Although it did help in controlling the more severe symptoms, I still had daily brain fog, random dizziness and imbalance spells. I took an MRI and it came back completely fine. For 4-5 more months, it stayed like this and I could only cope and use mild sedatives to get through when it got bad. I also got an ECOG test done in suspicion it was Meniere's, but it seems fairly ruled out as my symptoms are daily and my hearing tests have come back perfect even when my dizziness etc. was bad. After searching for doctors one day I found an ENT that diagnosed me with vestibular migraines. It seemed to make a lot of sense and I thought I had finally found what was wrong; albeit I only had sensitivity to -very- loud sounds, and not in general nor any other distinctive migraine symptoms. He put me on Magnesium Oxide, Vitamin B2, and Coenzyme Q 10. After just a couple of days of taking them, I seemed to have a reaction and my symptoms went out of control and what was before mostly vestibular-only symptoms with brain fog became neurologic and migrainous. It put me into the ER with severe cognitive and focal dysfunction, tinging in my limbs, and cold hands/feet. After finally recovering my symptoms have permanent changed and I almost completely no longer have those vestibular symptoms before, and now milder versions of what put me in the ER — varying cognitive and/or memory dysfunction, limb and tingling issues, visual (and/or spacial) and mental focus issues — and fatigue. It does not seem to be specifically a migraine or a tension-type headache, there seems to certainly be something neurological going on. I have taken a VNG and EEG that I will be getting the results of back soon, but none of this is making any sense.I was once again told it was anxiety and my primary doctor put me on a generalized anxiety disorder medication that gave me a similar reaction that put me in the ER. I know very well now I don't have generalized anxiety, but rather panic disorder during flares of my symptoms. When my symptoms are under control - they're there and they may change but I'm mentally under control.Very recently, I stumbled upon Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME or CFS). It seems to encompass a lot of my secondary and primary symptoms and could explain why the symptoms have changed so dramatically - including sensitivity to new medicine. However, my fatigue is not extreme nor does it get worse after everyday activity - I am generally functional and the fatigue is generally my limbs occasionally. I don't think this or the class of this type of disorder is it but it seemed to encompass so many of my symptoms.Lastly, I've begun to look at New Daily Persistent Headache, as it too seems to encompass the complexity of my symptoms. It is very strange, however, that before I had *only* vestibular symptoms with some brain fog and now essentially neurological symptoms. As I continue to talk to neurologists I can only point out the similarity between my symptoms and ME and/or NDPH. I truly have no idea what this is. Anxiety does have a lot to do with but I have a regime can keep it under control even during flares and even then some days I wake up worse than others.This has been a long battle but I have seen signs of relief and I know I can win. I just need any sort of clue. I am completely unsure if it's my living conditions which I have had thoroughly cleaned, or a new allergy, or something I'm eating. I've had blood work done and only my vitamin D seemed to be low, which I'm on supplements for now. I will ask my doctor again about iron. If someone could provide any insight or information I would be very appreciative."

Headache,8 day headache on right side of my head after recovering from the flu ,"I had the flu 2weeks ago and was given Tamiflu, cough meds and nasal spray by the doctor at urgent care. I started feeling better except for just some left over nasal congestion and coughing. Exactly a week after being diagnosed with the flu and still not feeling 100%, I got this horrible headache on the top R side of my head and into my fore head & temple that occasionally radiates down into the back of my head. I wouldnt say it debilitating, but very annoying, frustrating and causing me alot of anxiety. None of my abortive medications are working to relieve the pain. I have been through this a few times before with a headache that has lasted for 6 months constant and then just goes. The last time in 2012 I ended up in the Michigan Head Pain and Neurological Institute in patient hospital. They were able to help he so much and found medications that worked for me and I have been using them ever since and they have always worked for me when I would have a very bad headache, but they are not workign this time and I am gettign very concerned. It’s only been 9 days and i am already a basket case over this. I have lost interest in everything and cannot concentrate on anything, I don’t even want ti get out of bed in the morning because i know that I’m going to have a headache, it is just consuming me. My family coworkers and friends are already tired of hearing about it. I cannot go through this again, i just don’t know what to do. I am not going from doctor to doctor to doctor again just to have them throw meds down my throat that don’t work. I feel like no one cares. It takes weeks to get an appointment, then thsy give you pills, sond you for an MRI, which takes another few weeks then go back for results which is another few weeks and in the mean time, I’m hurting and have high anxiety adn have trouble functioning. The strange thing is that my headache is different this time, its only one sided and its not as intense as in the past and it come on right after a bought with the flu. Im not sure what to do here. Nothing helps. Could the flu virus have anything to do with this? Its very expensive for me to go back up to the Michigan Head Pain Cliinic, but i feel like the doctors her are just a waste of my time. Currently i am on Amoxicillin 875 2x per day and prednisone taper since my primary doctor thinks its a sinus infection after the flu, but I’m not convinced, it doesn’t seem to be working either. Any suggestions would be appreciated. "

Headache,Constant Pressure in Temples for 3 months,"Hi,I am a 19 year old male who moved to North Dakota from living in Texas my entire life about a year ago. Three months ago, I had a laparoscopic hernia repair surgery under general anesthesia. About a week after the surgery, I felt a headache come on, but didn't think much of it at the time. After about a week with this headache, I began to worry. Initially, I thought that it may have been caused by analgesic overuse, having taken percocets, aleve, etc. following the surgery. It has now been three months with this ceaseless bitemporal pressure. My symptoms include:-Constant pressure in temples/head-A recent onset of floaters in my eyes (had none prior)-Difficulty focusing visually, and mentally-Mental FogI have seen a neurologist, an ENT, a chiropractor, and a number of GPS. I have had the following tests:-MRI-CT Scan-Thyroid Study-Blood-work for lyme disease, west nile virus, syphilis, and magnesium levels.Things I have found that make the pain worse:Some physical activity (I.E. Vaulting up a flight of stairs)StressMissing MealsThings that seem to improve the condition of the headaches:FoodRizatriptan (maxalt)LorazepamI appreciate any insight as to what this could be, as I am quickly losing hope in ever feeling normal again. Please, any suggestions are appreciated. Could this be related to blood pressure? Could it be kidney damage from excessive analgesics following a surgery? Environmental, maybe?Any help is appreciated; thank you. "

Headache,Headache :( anyone else,"Hi everyone. So for the last month and a half I have suffered nearly every day with pressure headaches. Now they're starting to hurt worse as in, more pain and the pain is mostly on the right side of the back of my head. Lately I've hurt in my forehead as well as the top of my head and the pressure gets super strong. Sometimes I hear and feel popping in my face / head and neck. I have lots of muscle spasms and have a Catscan scheduled for next week. I suffer with severe health anxiety which makes dealing with this so much worse. Just want to know I'm not alone. I've felt vision changes, off balance, a few dizzy spells. numbness in right arm & foot. And tonight I've been freaked out because I woke up with the right side of my head feeling like it was going to explode dozing in and out of sleep my dreams start by seeming like the picture in my head flashing?

Headache,Suffering from head pressure and chest pain,"I am 20 year old male.

But the chest pain did not improve. Everytime I lift something, or do even a little exercise or even sit straight for a while I get so much intense pain in my chest. It's like being physically disabled. But to add further to my sufferings, maybe it was the painkillers, I don't know, but one day when studying, I started having extreme pressure in back of my head.

Headache,Chiari 1 - normal CSF flow but with symptoms,"Hi all,I have been diagnosed with Chiari 1 (7mm herniation of tonsils) one month ago. The MRI shows that the CSF flow is normal and no compression phenomena are found in this area.However, since I was 17, I suffer from vertigo and extreme headaches that have lasted 5 years in total so far (yes, 5 years non-stop). I have balance problems, cognitive problems and memory loss. My right hand and leg have gone numb and weak from time to time. Chronic fatigue is also another big problem. Symptoms are exacerbated when I have those tension headaches that feel more like neuralgia. Once I had a crisis that affected the right side of my brain and body and hit very hard my trigeminal nerve.I do not have the typical Chiari 1 symptoms (cough headache, neck or shoulder pain).Most doctors say that my symptoms do not have to do with Chiari 1. The best doctor I have been so far said that CSF flow may look normal but sometimes my brain may swell and block the CFS flow causing all those symptoms.Does anybody here have normal CFS flow and broad foramen magnum but still have extreme symptoms?I attach a photo of my Chiari.Your opinion will be highly valued and appreciated!I am almost invalid. I am 29."

Headache,Anxiety and brain aneurysm fear! ,My whole life I have dealt with severe anxiety but over the past year it had escalated into health anxiety. I know that a lot of the things I feel are due to my anxiety but some of my symptoms are so bad that it’s hard to believe anxiety could be causing them. For the past couple of months I have dealt with awful headaches and and odd sensations in my head and brain fog/ de realization. I went to a neurologist who sent me for an mri which came back normal with just some wear and tear in my neck( do to extreme stress). I am now terrified that I have a brain aneurysm because I have all of the warning signs. I just got my mri done 4 months ago and I’m now scared that one could of developed over that period of time! I’m not sure if it’s even possible for one to develop that quickly but I thought I’d give it a shot to post on here to see if anyone has any insight on brain aneurysm and how they work to give me some peace of mind !!!

Headache,Does anyone else experienced this dizziness and headaches? ,"Hi Everyone-I would REALLY appreciate your comments and advice. I am a 26 year old and have been struggling with severe dizziness for the past two years. It has gotten worse and I have suffered with additional symptoms- severe headaches that last days, weakness, focus issues, tingling in my hands and legs, distorted vision, twitching, buzzing in my head, sensitivity to light and sound and eye pressure.It has ruined many experiences for me, and I often just want to lay down and cannot stand for too long. The headaches are throbbing and it has messed with my focus and memory. I have had to call out of work or leave because of how I am feeling, and I no longer am able to enjoy the things I love. It is very uncomfortable and I am desperate for an answer. I have been told that it is anxiety but I know my body and it is beyond ""just anxiety"". The constant headaches are new within the month- but they will not go away. I go to bed with them and wake up in pain. It throws off my day and makes me really worried. It is hard to hold a conversation and keep my head up. I am desperate for a solution. I miss being happy and living my life.Thank you for reading!! "

Headache,Cracking sensation in skull,"Hi, so I've been having this problem for over a month now and was hoping some of you could give me a piece of advice.It started about a week after I had gotten off a long flight (dont know if it has anything to do with it). After getting home I've been having blocked ears, had a bit of a cold and after a week I started getting this cracking sensation in my skull. Every time I put pressure on these certain spots on my head (mainly behind my right ear and above it) it produces a cracking/popping sound, similar to when you would crack your joints. It's not really the typical crackling in ears or the neck. It happens when I lean my head on something or when I knowingly want to crack it. It's not painful but I tend to have headaches and get a little dizzy (could totally be anxiety related as I do suffer from it). I went to the doctor's, had an xray of my cervical spine and my sinuses done - everything came out fine. I've also been to the ENT, they said they could see the eardrums still being retracted but nothing else.The ears have gotten a lot better as well as the other symptoms but what keeps me worried is the constant cracking in the skull which is very uncomfortable.I'd be grateful for any suggestions or opinions!also forgot to mention - I'm a fairly young female - 19 years old"
Headache,Headache By Ear and Tingly Jaw on Right Side,"Hi everyone,I am 22 years old. For about 2 years now I've been having episodes of having a tingly jaw and tingly back teeth, sometimes with head pain that occurs by my right ear. I had an MRI near when it first started for this reason and everything was normal. The head pain has now come back in the same spot and because I have health anxiety, I am worried. When I touch the spot it hurts near my ear, I can feel a vein pulsing there with my hand. This may just be a coincidence, but the MRI would have caught things like a brain aneurysm, correct? Does anyone else experience this sort of thing? Thanks for all positive input!"
Headache,Headaches w/ Brain Fog 24/7,"Hello,I have been having 24/7 headaches for 3 years now. Additionally, it feels like a part of my brain is not working, and I have trouble concentrating and remembering certain things. I have the sensation that I am constantly living in a dream.The headache appeared suddenly out of nowhere one day. It is better in the morning and gets worse progressively throughout the day. My condition seems to improve slightly when I lay down. Physical and mental exercise both make it worse.Doctors do not know what it is, and a brain MRI has failed to detect anything. Any clues?Thank you."

Headache,Pain in left temple area of head,I have a had a constant dull ache in the left temple area of my head for the last 8 months now.I have had an Mri scan and been examined by a neurologist but nothing of note was found in any of the tests. I was even tested for giant cell arteritis despite not being in the demographic for that disease but the tests were all negative.Thinking it might be tooth related I saw a dentist who found a deep decay in my upper 1st left molar. I had a root canal on this tooth 6 weeks ago but the pain is still there in my temple.The pain is there all the time. It varies on the pain scale from a 3/4 at its best up to a 7 or even 8 at its worse.I am a 37 year old man. Otherwise in good health. This pain is really starting to affect my life. I cannot concentrate when the pain is particularly bad and am taking so many pain killers to just try and keep it at a reasonable level. I am hoping someone can help me
Headache,Should I get scanned? Strange migraines.,"For almost a year, i have been struggling with migraines at night. I would have trouble sleeping because the migraines I have induce flashing lights and colored vision (mostly green). However, about 2-3 weeks ago, i noticed a change. I now get a migraine at the top right of my head all day and all night. The pain will be on and off and can get worse when I do any activities looking down. Sometimes the pain may wake me up at around 3-4 AM with pain sometimes running down to the top of my right eye.I don't know if I should be really concerned... A part of me thinks its serious and another one does not. Seeking advice here, because it's expensive to have it checked out and I would rather have my mom (who has some foot problems) get sorted out first.Things I should mention: I am a 19 year old FemaleChanges that have occured a week later since the start of these new migraines are:- I got sick with the common cold (new migraine pain/pattern started days before)- I had gotten my period (also, new migraine pain/pattern started days before and continues now that I'm off my period Please help me, I'm so confused and nervous! :,("

Headache,"HEADACHE; ALL DAY, EVERYDAY, Help Appreciated "," Hello all, i have come to this site in search of an answer to a seemingly impossible question. After seeing multiple doctors, a ENT, a nuerologist and now doing the rounds of physio and chiropracture i still have no clue on what i seem to be suffering with. Three months ago, after a day or two of feeling like i have had a cold, i woke up with intense pressure in the head. At first the thought of meningitis or a tumor/aneurysm came to mind due to the 24/7 intense pain. But after a MRI, CT and CTA scan it was ruled out. The nuerologist just did a reflex test and looked at the MRI which was already confirmed normal and told me to just see how it goes. The goes with the doctors, because all my tests have come back normal they classify me as a worry wart or i have anxiety but i am just a realist. I have constant pain in my head and face, tightness in the neck, ears need to pop all the time and body aches especially with the legs and lower back pain although i am not sure if my lower pack pain is a seperate issue or not as a i am a nurse and my job applies alot of pressure to that region. I am not letting the doctors fob me off to walk away with a ""mystery illness"" as i have told them im just gonna keep coming back till they find out whats wrong. Ive also had a chest x ray, blood work done, a urea breathing test, an ultrasound of my heart and lungs, a test for STDs and all have come back normal. I just have no idea where to go from here? if anybody has a clue on where to go, i would appreciate more than ever some input. Thank you "
Headache,Worried that my ‘tension headaches’ are something more sinister.,"Was hoping to hear from anyone else that has had similar symptoms to me. I am a generally healthy 19 year old who until recently has never had headaches before. Then suddenly about 3 weeks ago I woke up with a mild headache on the left side of my head and a general feeling of pressure. The headache has not gone away atall since then. Sometimes it gets worse and hurts my right side too. My vision has become a bit blurry and I feel a bit dizzy and out of it most of the time. This has meant that I have spent several of my days off just sleeping as I can’t stay awake, which is also very unlike me. I went to my opticians who said they didn’t think I needed glasses and my doctors who told me it was probably tension headaches and it should go away in a day or two. I was given migreleif which I tried taking but it only got rid of the pain not the vision problems and pressure feeling in my head. I am just worried that it could be something more serious but my doctors have no appts. available for the next 3 weeks so there isn’t much I can do. It is making me very anxious as I just don’t feel right and have a gut feeling that something is seriously wrong as I have never heard of anyone having a headache for weeks at a time and feeling the way I do. Hope to hear in anyone has had similar symptoms and what there outcome was "
Headache,I've been having headaches tiredness dizziness etc for 2weeks. What does my Complete Blood Test say?,"Hi. I'm a 25 years old male. I've been experiencing headaches (intensity and location keep changing but mostly at top of head, forehead and become more intense at night), weakness, tiredness, restlessness and mental exhaustion for 2 weeks. I went to a GP and he ordered a Complete Blood Count test. It may be a few weeks before I might be able to visit my doctor again, so I thought maybe somebody on this forum could take a look at my test reports and see if there's anything suspicious or urgent? I have attached a photo of my test report. Thanks PS: I've been taking Omeprazole 40mg once every night for a month for my acid reflux problemEdit: below are my test's readings.

Headache,Waking up with a cloudy head,"Hello, I am a 26 year old female.I'm here for a second opinion as a last resort after trying everything I can think of hopes someone can give me an Idea of what may be causing me waking up in the mornings with a cloudy head. My main concern is when I become pregnant and having to deal with constant headaches with out taking drugs and while at work.Here is all my information:•Waking up in the morning with a cloudy head, been going on for 8 years and occurs randomly about 20 times in a month.•Been to the doctors, they can't figure it out. Had my blood and heart tested and the results came out healthy. The doctor stated that no other further tests or scans where necessary.•The cloudy head turns into more of a tension headache 2-3 hours after I wake up (tension/pressure band across my head and or behind my eyes or sometimes only one side of the head). They are usually only mild and light/sound do not bother me and I can keep working.2 Extra strength ibuprofen only and 9 times out of 10 works to either take the edge off or completely clear my head. No other or unusual symptoms occur ever or rarely.•I made a journal for two months of my entire day. The only ""triggers"" seem to be the weather (Barometric pressure/heat) and stress, but no real pattern or obvious triggers. It all seemed random.•I have no health conditions, I am quite healthy and have only really dealt with mild anxiety for most my life but over the past couple of years I have learned to over come, manage and control it never taking drugs for it.I mainly only experience heart palpitations, 2-4 times a month and sudden racing heart and armpit sweat, mainly triggered by trivial stressful situations.•I have a strict routine when it comes to diet, sleep and exercise. Sleep:•I work early so I have a routine of going to bed at 9pm and waking up at 5am. I've tried getting less sleep to see if I was getting to much, 6-7 hours, but it did not seem to work or help.•I originally was a side sleeper, learned to then sleep staying on my back with perfect posture with many types of pillows. I even learned to sleep sitting up on a 70* angle on a wedge pillow, with a neck, arms and legs pillows to see if what ever was not draining properly if that is even a thing.It seemed to work but still woke up every so often with a cloudy head or even a mild tension headache.•I even tried the natural route with listening to guided meditations before bed, yoga and lavender oil, which it all seemed to work great for a de-stressor.•I make sure to keep away from my phone throughout the day and before bed and eliminate any stressors throughout the day. •I don't eat or drink anything but sips of water 4 hours before bed.Diet:• I eat very healthy, I only drink water, about 3 letters a day. I mainly eat vegetables, fruit, chicken/fish and more. I don't eat, (placebo effect or not it's been working for two years) beef/pork, (inflammation) wheat/milk, potatoes, rice (bloating, constipation/ diahreah, sugar conversion), junk food, anything high in sugar or salt. Such a strict diet mainly for my menstral cycle/hormones, any thing that converts to sugar or high in salt seems to make my period extreamly achey and strong cramps, now I hardly get any symptoms. Also, I don't like most of those foods anyways.•I eat breakfast no later than 1 hour after I wake up, I eat the same thing everyday. 2 scrambled eggs cooked in 1 tsp coconut oil, with 1 avocado with a side of homemade oatmeal with unsweetened almond milk.•I eat smaller meals throughout the day about every 2-4 hours.•I have never, and do not consume alcohol, caffeine nor do I smoke.Exercise:•I work 8 hours a day 5 days a week, constantly on my feet walking around, of an average of 12,000 steps a day. On my days off I go for 30min-1hr power walks.•I practice yoga 4 times a week.Remedies I use to cope with the symptoms:•Microwavable heat pad I place on my forehead and take a 45min- 2 hour nap. (A nap 7 out 10 times works to relieve my tention headaches.)•Epsom salt baths.•Peppermint essential oil on both sides of my temples.•Fruit smoothie to get a ""brain freeze"" to relieve head tension. •Self massage and neck/shoulder rolls, massage tools for my back.•Breathing techniques.•I've tried all sorts of vitamins and supplements.Conclusion:•Just one month ago I got my eyes tested for the first time and got a basic prescription to wear all the time. The glasses seem to be working and it seems I can get rid of headaches quicker and my eyes don't get as tired with tension so far.•The only thing I can think of that is causing the cloudy head in the mornings is if I have im having an odd sleep and my shoulders and or neck is not in a good position that may be causing it.•I tell my husband to move me if my arms are up or I'm in a weird position. I don't grind my teeth. I sleep with a fan on and the window and door open for fresh air flow during my entire sleep.Thank you greatly for your time and help."
Headache,"Severe headache for weeks, doctors can't find why","Hi everyone.I have a big problem, that made me go and register on many forums and groups online, to help with my friend's sickness. He is now 8 days in the hospital with severe headache almost all day, and no doctor can find what's wrong with him. I will try to tell you about the symptoms, and the many tests he did, but no results, all shown he is as healthy as it gets.I want to apologise in advance for any grammar or medical mistake I might make when trying to describe his condition.Last two months he has been having fever (febrile) up to 38c. Especially short time after he woke up in the morning. Also he started seeing white dots many times during the day (the white blood cells we have in the eyes I guess). His blood pressure changes drastically many times during the day, going from 90-40, up to 190-120. He also shakes during the day a couple of times and loses conscience. When the headache starts it feels like his back of the head is heating a lot, then he looses conscience and shakes.This is the list of tests he did, and nothing showed in them - hematology test- immunology test- echo test for the heart, kidney, blood vessels, abdomen- acupuncture for the spine- CRP- Jaundice test- SedimentationAlso did test for infection, nothing shows. He is only using pills for the blood pressure, Nebilet 5mg, half pill every day.Any ideas what this might be? What tests should he do next? He is so desperate, the headache is so unbearable sometimes that he starts hitting the wall with it, hoping it will go away.. This is so bad "
Headache,Weird pressure and tightness in the right side of the head for weeks,"I started having this weird pressure and tightness in the right side of my head after waking up from bed. I thought it was just a tension headache, but it turns out that this headache lasted for a few days and was persistent. The pain wasn’t very severe, but it was pretty annoying and aggravating. The pain on the right side of my head alternates to the left side of my head, or both, but mostly, the pain is on the right side of my head. I’ve been so scared about this condition for weeks now. I also feel like my behavior has changed a bit, but not my personality. I just really want to get rid of this headache fast, because I have no idea what is causing this or how. Please help?"

Headache,Gradual increase in headaches ,"I saw a neurologist 4 months ago regarding headaches, apparently I have 2 types. 1 that is there all the time but is what I consider to be mild and then one that can be so strong it makes me stop everything as I can't think of focus.I stated my symptoms to the neurologist as:- Sensitive to light (light can even be too bright when wearing sunglasses)- Strong headaches, sometimes burning, head in a vice, lots of pressure - Always very warm- Vomitting several times a week- Can't tolerate long drives - I forget lots of things and can't remember anything during a strong headache They tried me on some medications.The first medications made me go to the toilet every 30minutes, literally busting. GP denyed that it would be the tablet but I stopped the tablet and my bladder function went back to normal in 2 days.2nd tablets they gave me caused bleeding. I'd wake up in the morning with blood on my pillow case. A decent amount too, coming from the nose and recently from 1 ear. I'm trying these tablets and it doesn't seem to be helping at all. My headaches are getting worse, gradually got worse.I've had no scans at present, just medication to start with. The headaches started years ago but as they got worse, I decided to inform the GP.Has anyone any recommendations in terms of non medications? Thanks"
Headache,"Head pressure, aching, dizziness...","So, yeah. I'm back with more worrying symptoms. Most of my physical problems can probably be written off as anxiety but this one I'm not so sure of.Yesterday I noticed a fleeting feeling of compression over my head, like my brain was being squeezed. It only lasted a second but it kept happening. I took off my headphones cause they're a bit tight-fitting but it didn't do much. I checked my throat and noticed my glands (or lymph nodes, I'm not sure. They were on the sides of my throat and behind my ears) were swollen. I figured I was just getting sick or something. So then I laid down, but that didn't help either. Finally I went for a walk and that's when it got weird.The compression kept happening on my walk, and on the way back I noticed I was feeling faint and dizzy. I actually had to sit down and collect myself for a few minutes before I was able to finish the walk home. By then I felt all kinds of weird, though I could attribute some of that to the cold weather as I'm sensitive to temperature.It kept happening throughout the day until eventually in the afternoon it was a constant thing, and with it came a pretty bad headache. I get headaches and migraines quite frequently, I always have, so I did what I always do-I waited it out, drank lots of water and went to sleep early. When I woke up I felt better, and the compression was gone. I figured it was just a weird migraine and went about my day with nothing but a little bit of acid reflux.However, now, in the afternoon of the next day, I'm feeling it coming back. Now, I have an extreme case of anxiety, namely health anxiety. Any time something goes even a little bit wrong in my body, I panic. I managed to convince myself I have a brain tumor and I'm going to die from it. I can't see a doctor until Oct. 24, three days from now. The emergency room is sick of seeing me-I've gone quite a few times in the past month. My last visit was a week ago where they confirmed my vitals and tests were normal. They did blood tests, urine tests, all that good stuff. All normal.However, last week I had a strong bout of dizziness and fatigue, but that was very likely a result of PMS. My tests came back normal for that. I did not receive any imaging that day, and I would have passed on it anyway as I have had too many x-rays these past few months and I'm terrified of radiation.I don't know if this is something I should panic about or not, but one thing's for sure, it's not getting any better the longer I think about it. Is there anything this might be that's not something horrible and deadly? I'm too scared to look up the symptoms of a tumor lest I fall into another panic attack and convince myself even more of my upcoming demise, but I'm also too afraid to look up my symptoms in general because that will have the same result. Any symptoms I should look out for, maybe remedies for the pressure? I really don't know what to do here. Any help is greatly appreciated."
Headache,"Chronic aching head pressure/tension, jaw tension , Brain fog.....","Hello everyone, I have been suffering tremendous head pain in the form of pressure/ tension for 2 years now. What happened was that I had an anxiety attack where I needed to get school work done before the deadline, but was completely sapped of energy due to excess sleep deprivation. I forced myself to stay awake and get the work done by unconsciously clenching my jaw muscles, breathing irregularly, sort of fidgeting in my chair, and letting my mind run a mile an hour to name a few, thereby not allowing my brain to shut off.When I went to bed after eventually getting the work done I slept so poorly. And from that day on I have been feeling so much aggravating pressure in my head that I can't think and function properly anymore. My jaw is full of tension 24-7, and I can't keep a straight face while breathing without holding all that tension. When I consciously try to let go of the tension, I involuntarily jolt either my head or my legs ( and there is always a kind of ""clicking/ knocking noise"" in my head associated with it ) I stoped working, taking college classes, seeing friends etc, as this condition is simply too painful and debilitating. What can this be, anyone ?"
Headache,Headache going on three weeks,"Background: 37 year old male, without a history of headaches. Back in January (4 months ago) I had back spasms, but recovered in a few weeks. About three weeks ago, I had what felt like an earache, but that subsided. A few days later, I started getting headaches. It felt like pressure in the back of the head, and my ears/hearing was off. This progressively got worse, so I decided to see a Doctor. The Doctor said I was having tension headaches, which I believed because I have a stressful job as a psychotherapist. For about a month prior to the headaches, I was working 50-60 hour work weeks, so it made sense. I've been taking OTC, and icing my head several times per day. The intensity is gone, but a mild headache remains, especially when I bend over. Overall, my headache has lasted about three weeks now. Any thoughts?

Headache,I have had (on a scale of 1 to 10) level 8 pain for 9 months.,"Hi, my name is Jean (pronounced shaan) and I am in 8th grade. I Was surfing one day, and the winds were blowing at tremedous speeds. I had got myself a nice wave, but I fell into the water.I jumped out of the water, and the wind had picked up my board and smashed it into my head. We visited the docter after a few days, because I had started to form some pretty bad headachs. She told us that I had a minor concussion, but it was nothing to worry about. After a while, my headaches had gotten worse, so we went to a chairopractor. The board had shifted my neck slightly And that was causing tension in all of my body, but most importantly, my neck. The pain was so bad, that ne needed to stick a needle (my arc nemises) into the muscles of my neck to make them bleed. That helped quite a bit. Now, 5 weeks later it has gotten so bat that I can't do school anymore. I literally spent half an hour working on one page in maths. My memory has gotten to the point of a goldfishes. Please, if there is some medication that might work on me please tell. Or if there is something we sould try, please tell me that. Don't suggest something crazy like getting an MRI. Those cost R13 000 ($1 075).Hi, my name is Jean (pronounced shaan) and I am in 8th grade. I Was surfing one day, and the winds were blowing at tremedous speeds.

Headache,"Pain behind left eye, temple & top teeth?","Hi,I have always suffered with headaches from a young age. I've tried beta-blockers and Amitriptyline which have worked on and off. I've now stopped taking them and gone back on citalopram for anxiety last week.

I saw the GP who checked my eye and said my optic disc looked ok and didn't know what it was. I have had the eye pain before but not for so many days in a row. If I take paracetamol it lessens the pain for a few hours and then comes back. Thought it could be sinus related as I keep getting mucus stuck, but I don't have a cold. Any ideas??"
Headache,Headache everyday. ,"I've been having really weird headaches that have been making me feel sick and unbalanced.. they are making me feel awful. I haven't actually been sick though.

Headache,Random throbbing head pain and pressure in right side,"For over a month now, I've had an infrequent throbbing pain & pressure on the right side of head. It appears randomly, and occurs much more frequently when I'm stressed. Although, when I feel fine it will still appear, just not as frequently. It's always on the right side of my head, near the top but will occasionally be at the back of my head too. I will feel it every single time when I wake up, without fail. That's the only time I can guarantee it'll be felt.I've had a CT scan done a few weeks ago which came out completely clear. I was thinking that it was my sinuses acting up, so I went to an ENT (Ear Nose & Throat) specialist, but they couldn't find anything wrong.I don't know what else it could possibly be. I'm starting to think that it may be my neck, but I'm not entirely sure ...Anyway, here's a summary:* Throbbing in head on the right side* Infrequent (appears at random)* Appears every day* Brings my mood down completely whenever it occurs* Had a CT scan; was completely clear* Sinuses are completely fine, and are clearPlease help."

Headache,Any chronic daily headaches and neck and back pain advice?,"I am a 28 year old female and I'm currently in my 20th month of chronic headaches. I am now on amitryptline, naproxen and paracetamol as I am now experiencing neck and back pain too. I never write on forums, but feel that if their is the slightest chance that anyone else is suffering like me then i'd love some words of advice or comfort. I feel that unless you deal with chronic pain, you really have no idea how hard it is to deal with and how difficult it is to speak to people about it, as nobody understands. The pain first first came on suddenly during intercourse and it felt like I'd been hit on the back of the head- it was excruciating. I was then left with occasional headaches. After a few months, I was admitted to A and E as the dr suspected a haemorrhage as the head pain started to worsen when straining for the toilet. I was in hospital and had CT, MRI and a lumbar puncture and all sinister problems were ruled out . Since then (19months) the head pain has increased to being constant- as in from the moment I wake till the moment I sleep, everyday. The drs have thrown the medication at me and labelled it as chronic daily headaches and their answer was always more drugs and that it is probably dietry or stress(as I am a teacher)! I then tried everything I could to relieve the pain/find the cause. I have had lots of massage types (including deep tissue), seen the usual dentist and optician, bought a new mattress, new shoes, seen a podiatrist, bought a water pillow(great for neck ache look for mediflow on amazon) acupuncture , I have omitted all food groups from my diet (see candida diet) even reflexology!... no luck, just a poorer and more destroyed version of me. Last week after having a nervous breakdown in the neurologists office and it seems for the first time i am being taken seriously. I think that if you're like me and you dont make a massive fuss, you dont cry lots and you just deal with it as best you can, then they will ignore you. TIP: When you see someone, explain your pain like it is your worst day, not the feeling right then and there and make a list of what you want from your appointment.I had an urgent MRi scan of my cervical spine last week as the neurologist now wants to rule out a slipped disc. I kind of hope that it is, because at at least I will finally have answer (hopefully this week)I don't know what I expect to come from writing here, other than for others to know that they are not alone. Constant pain is truly soul destroying. I now feel only the shadow of my former self. It's hard for others to understand and as a result you drift away from life. I am lucky to have a partner who is completely positive and supportive everyday. Surprisingly though, I have found that one of the best things for me is distraction and the 30 5-6 year olds at work are actually the best thing for me- can you believe it!Thanks for reading. If anyone has any advice, I am all ears!"
Headache,Anxiety of an aneurysm help please,"So for the past 6 months I have been so scared of having a Brian aneurysm, my panic attacks get so bad that I have to stay home from work sometimes and I feel like I can’t function. Any weird pulse or pain I have in my head makes me feel like I am having one. I had an mri done about 2 months ago and it was clear, I have had 3 ct scans before that. I am on three medications for headaches and for anxiety. I am 21 years old and the doctors say I am so healthy. Would I know if I was having a brain aneurysm? I always think I need to go to the hospital. Right now I keep getting this bulging feeling in my right temple and i think of course that it is one about to burst. Also if I get hot at all my whole entire body feels like there is ants on it, like pins and needles. I also had an mri on my neck and I had two disc that where slightly messed up. What should I do. I’m just ready to live a normal life again. All I do is worry. The other day I was grilling with my buddy and I felt like I had a knife going into my head behind my right ear. Someone help me please."

Headache,Help! Please! :(,"Hi all, I don’t suffer with headaches. However the past 4 weeks I have had a constant headache/migraine of varying pain. There’s is a constant dull ache in my temples and where my soft spot would be. When it gets bad it acts like a migraines and covers my forehead and eyes. No pain relief works. It is driving me insane!! My dr has been treating it as it is my sinuses. I suffer with my sinuses but never like this. So far I have tried : nasal spray (2 different ones), prescribed decongestant. The dr has started me on today a 7 day course of steroids. He has said I can have a scan if the steroids don’t work. He has looked up my nose and said my sinuses are swollen and inflamed. I am worried about this being something more than just my sinuses. What if it is a tumor? Has anyone suffered with anything similar? A headache non-stop for 4 weeks! No pain relief that works and I almost always feel sick now. Thank you in advance. "
Headache,Help with sleep,"Hi AllSo I've been suffering with tension/migraine headaches everyday since last June. Its been a nightmare.So I'm on sertraline as my mood was seriously affected.I did try amitriptaline.Was on them for 4 months.They did not clear the headaches. The sertaline are starting to work on occasions so I think it is just a matter of selecting the correct dosage.I suppose I also need to look at what is causing the headaches.It looks like it may be a combination of OCD anxiety & depression.With some rumination thrown in.So I'm wonder what ppl take to help with sleep.The amitriptaline was helping but my doc tells me it can't take them with sertraline due to the risk of serotonin syndrome. I have tried 25mg of phenerghan but they leave me very groggy in the morning with no energy.At the moment I take 2 kalms night but I wake every hour with them as the tension seems to get worse at night when I settle down.Does anybody else suffer like wise and what meds do they take ?"
Headache,On and off headache for about 2 weeks,"Hello, I've been experiencing on and off headaches for about 2 weeks now. They're dull pains on the left side of my head. Some days I don't even have headaches at all. I sometimes get a throbbing pain when I stand up or move around, which then dissapears after a few seconds. I've had one time where I felt slightly nauseous, which waved over after a few minutes.For a while I was convinced I had a brain tumor, but after doing some research I realised my headaches aren't severe enough at all for an ER visit, and I don't experience any of the symptoms besides headaches.Maybe I should add that I'm not on any medication.I haven't consulted a doctor about it (yet), because I rarely do so. Most of the time when I'm feeling sick, it disappears after a few days. Any help will be greatly appreciated.Hello, I've been experiencing on and off headaches for about 2 weeks now.

Headache,"Have had an unremitting headache with visual disturbance for 155 straight days, please advise","I am a 18 year old white male, 6'7 200lbs.Currently on Nortyptaline, ineffective after 10 weeks 50mg dose.Cause is unknown, no doctor has been able to identify the cause and most hardly even seem to care. My neurologist told me to ""be less stressed"" even though I was not stressed upon onset, nor am I now.I have had it for 155 consecutive days with no change.Symptoms: Pain Level 4-7 Headache with pain centralized in the front upper right of temple, spreading over and around forehead to left temple but pain less intense in these areas, 3-5Visual Disturbance, difficult to describe but includes difficulty “zoning in” on objects, makes it difficult to read and hard to focus on the “big picture”, school nearly impossibleAs for treatment, so far I have triedIbuprofen - No effectNaproxen Sodium - No effectExcedrin - No effectToradol Shot - No effectSumatriptan - No effectZoloft - No effectNortriptyline - Used for 10 weeks no effectNSAID Gel for temple - No effectChiropractic Massage - No effectSports medicine massage - No effectVision Therapy - No effectConsistent Exercise - No effectHealthy Diet - No effectGlasses - Slight pain reduction due to less visual stimulusI have gone to all variety of doctors, had my eyes checked, intracranial pressure checked, mri, ct scan, blood tests and everything seems to be functioning perfectly.I have had migraine and tension headaches in the past, but this pain is not comparable to those, nor is responsive to the medicines I've been prescribed for them.My current theory is that I have a weird case of Temporal Arteritus. I think my unusual vision problems could reasonably be linked to inflammation in the internal carotid artery which can in turn affect the ophthalmic artery, resulting in changes to vision that would not be perceivable to an ophthalmologist because there would be no change to the structure/positioning of my eyes nor would it have any effect on intracranial pressure.When I pitched this to my new primary care doctor, he dismissed it without even bothering to check my head.I feel like I'm running out of options and my life is falling apart. It is baffling to me that with all of the medical knowledge out there, nobody seems to know what's wrong with me.If anyone has ever heard of anything like this, or has a suggestion of what I should do next, I would very much like to hear it, thank you"

Headache,Head pressure... HELP IM SCARED,"Hello everyone Just wanting to seek some help and see if anyone has had what I am currently going through. About 3-4 months ago I started feeling this weird sensation in my head. It's a pressure feeling, almost like a pulling feeling in my head. It comes and goes and happens in different places in my head. Sometimes it will be across the sides of my head, sometimes on the top back of my head, sometimes at the back of my neck. IT IS NOT A HEADACHE. Everything I look up implies its a tension headache but there is absolutely no pain with this it is more of an uncomfortable sensation. It almost feels like my head is being pulled to one side. It comes and goes through out the day. At first I thought it was me needing glasses. I went and got my eyes tested and I did need them. The glasses helped with it at first but now I've had them about two months its still happening. It happens more when I don't have the glasses on but still does happen when I do have them on. I might add when this does happen my eyes get a really tired feeling around them. I have also found that sitting my head back as if i was laying down tends to make the feeling go away. I have been to my doctor and he gave me a blood test which just resulted in me having to up my iron intake which has been upped for over a month now and nothing has changed.If anyone could help or suggest anything that would be great. I'm so scared I have something like a brain tumour. I just want to know whats going on with me and make it stop its controlling my life. Please help. "

It can go from a dull fuzzy feeling to a pulsing headache to a stab other days. Im also feeling tired, pain behind eyes and in face and jaw some times. They are mainly right sided but sometimes are all over. They majority of the time are accompanied with pain in the neck and at base of the skull.

At this appointment I spoke to a lady who wrote down notes of everything I explained to her and she took them to show another lady whom I assume was the neurologist. She came back with its a continues headache with migraine tendencies diagnosis , and said I wouldn't need to be seen again and to try a cocktail of different drugs... MRI came back clear and I was told by the doctor over the phone it will just go on it's own. Which I find hard to believe. I have also never been sent for any blood work.I'm feeling really lost in what to do next as success with the doctors is next to nothing as there only course of action is to keep drugging me up without trying to find an actual cause of the pain. The constant pain is very tiring and wears you down. I'm thinking it could be my posture from being a hairdresser or it could be to do with my bite with the jaw pain. I just want to feel like my old self again without this headache. Any suggestions or has anyone felt like this? Thanks in advance ! "
Headache,Constant headache for 5 months- what is it and what can I do??,"I’ve had a constant headache for just over five months. It’s at the back of my head (and can get aching in my neck too). It’s 24/7- there when I wake up and go to sleep. I’ve had a brain scan, my bloods taken twice, acupuncture, massages and osteopathy, none of which has made a single bit of difference. Feeling desperate. Any advice/similar experiences/idea of what it might be very welcome! Thanks "
Headache,Brain tumour anxiety please someone help ,"Hey everyone i'm Josh and i'm a 17 year old male, and i have been so scared, stressed and anxious about having a brain tumour, here is why. I have had a what i can only describe as a tension headache for 4 weeks straight, medicine does relive the pain but it comes back, the pain isn't very bad at all on a scale i would rate it a 4/10, it hurts around my temples, dull aching on the forehead, and sharp pains near the back of the head, so all over. the reason i think i have been getting this headache is because i spend nearly most of me day on the computer playing games, and if i'm not on my computer i'm on my phone.Anyway here is the Symptoms i am worried about, sometimes, not all the time i wake up feeling sick, especially if i have been stressed or anxious the night before and this gets me so worried because i think i have a brain tumour although the feeling sick goes away with some deep breaths and me walking around the house, i have not been sick and don't feel like i will, I can still do exercise and that helps me a lot because i am not constantly thinking about it, another symptom i have is some muscle spasms in sometimes my legs but not very often only when i am stressed out, one other symptom i have is when i cough i get a sharp pain sometimes not all the time though and i'm not sure what this is, i have no other symptoms like i'm completely fine otherwise.I have been to the doctors, had eye tests,had a blood test and been to the hospital and there is no pressure behind my eyes and i'm till waiting for my result for my blood test. Also in addition i had a MRI 2 years ago and it came back all clear, i am having another scan soon but i am getting so anxious and stressed can someone tell me if these symptoms are a brain tumour or if its just anxiety, also one more thing i have been diagnosed with OCD and anxiety before but i am just really scared, please could someone help me?? also i'm non stop looking up symptoms and its making me worse, i'm not sure if this nausea is a brain tumour or anxiety im so scared please someone help thanks.

Headache,Head pain/pressure/dizziness and blurred vision ,"Hey everyone, I am so so scared and this is my last place to try and find some answers. I’m literally in the doctors every week, tried so many different tablets I’ve had MRI scan a couple of months ago and it’s clear. I’m currently going to CBT to talk to someone about my worries and I’ve been signed off work. I honestly think I am going to die. I am surrering with constant pains and sensations in my head all day everyday. I wake up feeling dizzy and with a headache and go to bed feeling the exact same and no tablets helps. It can go from burning pain to throbbing pain to pins and needle pain, to tingling and just my head feels heavy and I feel so much pressure in my head. As well as feeling jumpy and dizzy and lightheaded and having these pains I also feel like I’m having spasms inside my head and I am so scared. Sorry for the long post. xx"

Headache,Hear Pressure,"Hello, It started about 7 weeks ago. I had a headache for a few days and then on the fourth day, I had a headache that would go away. I currently have head pressure that will not go away. It is in the top, back and sides of my head and my neck seems to be stiff at times. I have had a CT, CTA scan, MRI with and without contrast and LP. They said they were all normal. I just don't feel right and I hate this head pressure. One of the neurologists suggested that I might have had viral meningitis, however when they did the LP it was 2 weeks after the on set of symptoms so I don't know if it would have showed up. When I did get the initial headache I did not have a fever or any congestion. Please help. I feel like I am ready to loose it. Hello, It started about 7 weeks ago.

Headache,"Chronic head pain and pressure in left temple and left side of face, loss of cognitive functioning","Hi all,I have been having 24/7 headaches and pressure in the left side of my head and face now for three and a half years. It feels like my movement is a bit restricted in the left side of my face. For example, when I smile, it feels a bit awkward and like I'm making an unnatural face. Yet, when I have gone to neurologists and they've done all the initial tests like testing the strength of each side of your body and seeing if your face is symmetrical when you smile, I always check out okay. The headaches began as a dull, constant pain and I didn't think much of it; however, the pain persisted and I began to go to doctors and get tests done to try to figure out what was going on. I have been given several antibiotics because I was told I had a sinus infection several times, but the antibiotics never took away the pain. I have gotten my sinuses checked and scanned, and everything checked out ok after taking the antibiotics, but the pain and pressure continued. I recently went to an allergist and he swabbed my nose and said that he found bacteria indicative of a sinus infection on the swab, so now for the fourth time I am going to be tried on an antibiotic- Clindamycin this time, whereas in the past it was always Augmentin. In the last 6 months, I have experienced changes in my cognitive functioning along with these headaches. It has become harder for me to think- I now do everything slower because it is very hard to focus and my thinking is sluggish. It is sometimes hard for me to remember things. Sometimes people will be talking and I just can't process in my mind what they are saying. Also, it seems that when my head is hurting more and/or when there is more pressure in my head, my OCD- type thoughts seem to flare up more (my OCD thoughts look like this- I think a bad thought when I am doing a certain action, therefore I have to repeat the action and think something different, and if I don't repeat the action, I believe something catastrophic is going to happen to me). I have gotten an MRI and CAT scan and both are normal. I have gotten many blood tests, tested for lyme disease, all have been negative.Just posting here to see if anyone has had a similar experience of passing all of the tests while still having very real chronic head and face pain and pressure along with some loss in cognitive functioning and OCD.

Headache,"Headache, dizziness, and neck pain","Has anyone else experienced weekly headaches that just seem to last no matter how much sleep you get or water you drink? I also have neck pain in which I have already seen both chiropractor and physical therapist for. When I have these headaches, I feel pressure behind my ways so intense I can't stand bright lights. On top of all this I am dizzy, however, my balance is totally fine. I have already been to an ENT specialist and had an MRI, etc. Only thing I haven't moved onto is a neurologist because I already am racking up my medical bills and yes I have health insurance but a crappy one at that! Please help. Has anyone else been experiencing this and if so, what did you do to rid it? Much appreciated!"
Headache,Extreme Head Pressure ,"Ive been having a lot of pressure in my head for the past few days. The pressure gets really bad on the left side of my head to the point I feel like my ear is going to blow out air like the cartoon characters. With the pressure comes fogginess, hard to concentrate and feeling pretty sleepy. The days before the pressure started I was getting a little dizzy with sudden movement. Has anyone experienced this?"
Headache,Headache when lightly touching left temple area,"Hello! For about a week, I've been having a strange headache. Overall, when I'm sitting, standing, walking, or doing something else nothing is bothering me, however I do feel some pressure coming from the back of my head. When I lightly touch my left temple area, I feel pain which seems to be coming from behind of my left ear inside of my head. If I push on my left temple instead of barely touching it, I don't feel any pain at all. It only appears when I lightly touch my left temple area. I don't have any problems with my speech, hearing, vision, or balance. I don't feel dizzy either. I'm eating and sleeping very well. I do feel some pressure in my head though - it's very light with no pain. It seems like it's pressing on my eyes and nose area from the inside, but again, very light. The symptoms that I feel did not get better or worse since the headache started a week ago. I did have a stress recently, and the weather has been changing from hot to freezing temperatures.

My anxiety doesn't help :-( And the last question to the ladies, do you get worse before or during period? I've had my eyes and ears checked, neurological exam and full blood test, all fine. How do you deal with with it, has anyone overcome them? "
Headache,Headache for a month scared it's a tumour ,"I am a 37 year old female who has been suffering with a headache for a month now. I went to emergency and they did a few tests like looking in my eyes with a light, making me push his hands with both my feet and a few other things. By doing these few tests he said it was 99% not a tumour. But it's 3 weeks later and I still have the headache. Over the counter medications do work until they are out of my system then it's back. It's not as bad as I here migraines are it's not that painful it's just annoying. Everyone is telling me it's stress or my eyes which I'm getting my eyes tested Wednesday but I think it's something serious. The pain is behind my eyes and the front of my head some times it's my whole head. When I'm laying down is when it pretty much goes away but there is still sometimes a shooting pain. Yes I've been under stress the last while but it doesn't feel like that type headache. Could the doctor be able to tell from those few tests weather it's really a tumour or not? I've never been more scared in my life thinking this is a tumour. I have no other symptoms just the slight headache. When I wake up its not there sometimes it's not there till afternoon. In the month that I've had it there was at least 7 days in between that it went away and when it came back my panic is back. Could it actually be chronic tension headaches or something none life threatening? Is there anyone out there with the same type of headaches or anyone who can reassure me that this isn't a brain tumour or aneurysm please.

Headache,Head Pressure/Fatigue Everyday,"Hello Everyone, My name is Nick for the past 6 years i have had head pressure above my eyes , heaviness of the eyes, fatigue no matter how much sleep i get and sinus issues. I have a deviated septum which i have a surgery scheduled next month to correct. I have tried everything to make this go away but nothing ever works. I had sleep study done, Bilateral Turbinte coblation, every nose spray/ allergy medication, allergy shots, thyroid checked, blood test, MRI, Ct scan that shows deviated septum. This is what brings me to the reason i scheduled my surgery out of shear desperation. Does anyone else have these symptoms and is there anything that helped you? It getting very tiring and depressing going to sleep feeling like this and waking up feeling like this every single day. Thank You!"
Headache,"Headaches for over 3 weeks - One sided, above and behind eye.","I'm a 19yr old student and I've had a constant dull pain above my left eye and behind for over 3 weeks now. The pain was fairly deep (pressure type) behind and on my eye brow - felt like sinus headache and often once a day got very painful to the point were I couldn't function properly.Originally the doctor said it was cluster headaches, however I was then told that it could possibly be my sinuses and was referred to an ENT specialist. I've had ringing in both ears for about 1 year and a popping/fullness in my left ear for about the same period of time. Never suffered from migraines although I have had my fair amount of headaches growing up due to stress, being tired etc. ENT said my problem was not sinuses, she used a camera up my nose to check. Also had hearing test which came back normal although she did say my left ear showed slight congestion or something which makes sense as this is were the popping is. She said the pain is neuropathic and is being caused by inflammation therefore she prescribed me 'Flixonase Nasule drops' to take twice a day for 6 weeks however she said this would take at least 2 weeks to work. I was originally taking a combination of Sudafed, Aspirin and Ibuprofen - Sometimes all togetheror sometimes just a combination of two which worked for about 5 days, with the occasional dose of Codine if needed. This stopped working and the doctor prescribed me 'Diclofenac' 50mg tablets and take 3 a day. This has almost completely taken my pain away with just some niggling pain - sensations sometimes, however this reminds me the problem is still there just being numbed by the inflammatory. Today I've been to the dentist to ensure there was no problems in my mouth. They said I've got wisdom teeth appearing on my left side however everything looks fine and just need to keep my eye on it and she doubts that is the cause of my headaches. Although she did say there is signs I may grind my teeth at night (no major problems) however I could get a mouth piece to wear at night, she said this could be causing headaches but it might be worth leaving it a few months. I've also had a clicking jaw which I've noticed more recently and whenever I eat now I can hear it popping. I'm completely confused as to whats actually wrong with me! Nobody is giving me a proper answer although something is clearly inflamed as diclofenac is working! If there is anybody who has had similar or knows about these things any reassurance would be great as this is bringing me down.Thanks"

Headache,Weird tingling/numbness on my left side,"Hello!I have been experiencing weird tingling/numbness on my head's left side. I frankly don't know how to describe this feeling I am having but I suppose these words describe it the best. I have been struggling with this weird feeling for quite a few years now but I never paid big attention to it because it was insignificant. Lately the tingliness has increased and is more severe. I usually don't have problems with this feeling but it is hard to fall asleep because I am forced to sleep on my left side. The reason why I have to sleep on the left side is because if I do so, I do not feel it. I can sleep on my right side but only if I put my other hand on my head. Essentially I have to cover the area on my head that has this weird feeling. Now that I experience it more I am very concerned about it. I have no idea what it is related to? I read some related topics but I couldn't find anything that would describe my problem the best. Some say it could be related to anxiety and stress but I don't think that is the case. I have never had a doctor appointment towards this matter. "
Headache,I’m making myself ill ,"I suffer with severe anxiety, and I have accepted that it’s something I am going to have to live with. But for 4 months now I have been getting daily headaches and I have literally convinced myself I have a brain tumour. I wake with a headache everyday, I get dizzy spells and at nighttime I get a numb right leg a bit like pins and needles. The worst thing I can do I know is google my symptoms, but I have. I’ve been to the doctors, dentist and opticians and they have all told me everything seems fine. My doctor has now referred me to a neurologist but the appointment is months away and I don’t know what to do I’m probably worrying over nothing but I don’t know how to stop and it’s probably making things worse! Can anyone give me any reassurance?! I don’t like being left on my own!"
Headache,Bizarre headache (or something) terrifying me,"I joined the forum just so I could get some possible input. Hello! The last few days I’ve been experiencing something that I honestly don’t know is a headache and it might get a bit lengthy so just bear with me...It started as a headache at night. I passed out early (around 9) but woke up at about 3am and couldn’t get back to sleep til about 9am. Slept for another couple of hrs but that was it. Each time I was awake my headache was progressively getting worse. It was in the front of my head. As the day went on the headache got worse but moved, from the top of my head eventually to the back of it. Took some otc meds like Tylenol, had some caffeine, even tried a couple of my husbands tramodol, nothing helped. By the time 2pm arrived I just layed in bed basically motionless til about 6pm. Not quite napping but closing my eyes and not moving felt best. After this I got up and took a shower, but the ‘headache’ had again morphed. By this time it’s moreso a strange pressure instead of pain, all over my head but more on the sides and in the back, accompanied with tingling and I feel dizzy, and like I’m underwater- I guess. Honestly it felt like I took some bad drugs. I don’t jnow how else to describe it. Almost like a dizzy-ish floating feeling. With also vision slightly fogged, as if there were smoke in the room. Took my shower, water felt both good and strange on my head. Once I get out and get dressed it’s gotten worse. I’m laying down again, my neck is stiff-ish, all my muscles that are usually tight or sore in my neck, shoulder and upper back region are more sore and tighter than normal. I have my husband rub me a bit. Helps for the time being but once he’s done it goes back to how it was. I try a heat pack on my neck, doesn’t help. Now it’s about 9pm, it feels like I’m on some serious drugs, my arms hurt and are a little tingly, my body feels like I’m both under water yet floaty, the pressure in my head is all time high, I feel like my body isn’t working right. Like my arms and legs are heavy, my neck and back hurt like no other, and I’ll get random sharp pain in the back of my head and in the front. I took a shot of espresso, some more Tylenol, and passed out early and slept through the whole night which is very odd for me as I have had insomnia since I was a kid and generally have to take something to fall asleep and actually stay asleep. I woke up this morning feeling slightly better but I can already feel it getting worse again like it did the day before. My neck and upper back and shoulders are tight and hurt, my body feels heavy, my head has weird pressure and it feels like my body and head are swimming. I feel drugged. It makes no sense to me. It’s triggering my anxiety and I can’t help but start to panic. A little bit about me: I’m a 34yo woman. Relatively healthy diet, not overweight or have any underlying health issues that I know of. Have had migraines but I always know when it’s a migraine. This is nothing like I’ve experienced. I suffer from anxiety but again, have had it since I was a kid and know how to manage when it comes up. This is nothing like what I’ve come across. I just recently started dealing with a decaying tooth from where a crown fell off (crooked dentists!!) so of course I started to look up sepsis and freaked myself out. I started taking antibiotics this morning just in case. The stiff neck also made me think meningitis and that also freaked me out. Have I mentioned I’m a hypochondriac? Lol. But seriously. Everything I look up has some features of what I’m experiencing but not quite. I know I shouldn’t self diagnose but the real problem here is I am actually staying in Thailand right now bc my husband is receiving non FDA treatment for a tumor. I don’t have a doctor or that much money, so unless this is an emergency situation I don’t really have the luxury of just going to my clinic or doctor. Does this sound like anything to anyone? I’m really starting to freak out. Any input or ideas is greatly appreciated! "
Headache,"persistant right skull headache (semsitive to sound and light), left leg radiation goes up","This is Mrityunjay computer science PhD student from India. I get right skull head pressure which starts from near by right ear. Some times I confuse with pain, mean to say, should I call it pain or head pressure. It is sensitive to light and sound.

I have gone to physiotherapist and one psychiatrist. But I have not relieved. How to relieve head pressure? Please suggest some thing in this regards."
Headache,6 weeks of constant headaches - no relief / going crazy,"Hi everyone. I'm after some possible insight / advice on what I'm currently going through. I will go through as many symptoms as possible, although I'm aware some might be from something different entirely. I started getting a heavy pressure at the back of my head around 6/7 weeks ago, was primarily at the back and kind of felt like my head had a big weight hanging from the back and someone was pushing hard against my skull from the inside. In the next few days this was accompanied by very frequent and fairly severe headaches. These have now been part of my life for the past 6 weeks. The headaches and pains I get differentiate. Mostly it's a dull throbbing at the back of my head. But recently quite often I get what I can only explain as a very sore burning pain on a small area of my forehead and sides of head. I get pains on both sides although i would probably crown the right side for most pain caused. I do get dizzy when I stand up from a relaxed position and have noticed that my face goes red a lot now, as if I've stepped indoors from cold to boiling. I have no energy to do any exercise and feel constantly fatigued and tired. My sleep isn't great as I wake up a lot through the night (may I add that it's not the headaches that wake me up, they seem non existent as I sleep and for the first half hour in the morning when I awake. But from then on its relentless. Painkillers do jack squat, even co-codomol doesn't touch it when that used to be my saving grace whenever I got a bad head. This is much different to headaches I have had before. Last think as well. I went to watch my football team play today and tried to do a warm up with them. Since then my head ache is worse and my brow and temples feel bruised and tender to touch.I apologise for the length of this but i didn't want to leave much out. I hope someone is able to helps with this as it's wearing me out now... Physically and mentally. Got an MRI on weds but I know results can take a while. Was just hoping for some feedback before hand.

Headache,"Headache for twelve days, with other symptoms ","So about 12 days ago, I? got a headache on my right side that was close too my temples and the top of my forehead but every once in a while I’d feel a throb on the left side as well, as if someone was sliding it across my forehead. and I? do have a family history of migraines and I’ve had them here and there so I? wasn’t too concerned. I? ended up Laying in the dark for a few hours and it hadn’t got better so I? got up too shower and then ready for bed. During that time, the Pain subsided a bit. I? went too bed and woke up the next morning and the headache had come back, that whole day I? couldn’t get out of bed or even use electronic devices because it hurt too much, I? tried to keep a positive attitude so when my boyfriend got home from work we started watching tv but I? was still in pain too the point I? couldn’t get up, then around time too sleep I? was fine for a few minutes, this continued into into the next day except that night it was worse than it had ever been before, it literally felt like my head was going too explode and I? kept smelling these horrible smells that my boyfriend could not, eventually I? showered and went to bed. The next day the headache was a bit better but not gone, so I? made the decision too visit urgent care, which is up the street but I? could barely drive because I? was unable too focus or think straight, the doctor said I? have sinusitis and prescribed me antibiotics. I? hadn’t noticed any other sinusitis symptoms other than a headache but I? didn’t really care as long as it would make me feel better. I’ve finished the antibiotics, and while the headache has subsided a tiny bit it’s definately still there and about 3 days ago I? was feeling extremely nauseated any eating or drinking felt like I? would throw up, even gagging at some points. I never threw up, but this has continued the past few days. I’ve lost total interest in most of my daily activities and simple tasks have become incredibly difficult due to the fatigue this has caused. Along with that my body has just been feeling weird. Like hard too move, and almost not there. I? do know these are all symptoms of migraines but last night something strange happened. I was sitting on the couch talking with my boyfriends roomate, and suddenly I? felt this like pinching pain inbetween my right shoulder and neck, and with movement it would shoot up the back of my head, so I basically was unable to move my neck altogether. it kept getting worse and apparently all of the sudden I? just blanked, completely stopped talking and curled into a weird position staring off into space, then my boyfriends roomate started talking to me again and I? could understand what he was saying but none of it was computing right, at this point I’d sat myself up but still felt unable too move, as if something was compressing my entire body, I? knew that I? could move if I? tried but it felt like it was impossible. still in that dazed state, my boyfriends roomate said something about my favorite movie and I? just burst into tears and sat there crying just staring into space, then having these intense moments of laughter. I? was talking but the things I? said we’re kind of odd, and there were long pauses where I? was thinking between my words. This lasted probably 15 -25 minutes before I? stood up went too the bathroom and sat on the couch again, at this point I? was Feeling coherent I? was siting on my phone just browsing the internet but everything around me felt blank, like my boyfriend and his roomate were conversing next too me and every once in a while they’d get my attention and rather than speaking I’d just mumble because putting out words was too much work. And my left hand just felt odd, it moved fine but it felt like it wasn’t there. I? went and fell asleep for two hours and reawoke with intense chest & lower jaw pain that hurt too move or breath. This morning I? woke up the neck pain is gone, I? still feel a little weird, and a little bit of pain is still in my chest. And the incident from last night almost feels as if it did not happen I? do not smoke, drink, or have caffeine, I’m pretty healthy. And I? also could not be pregnant. wondering if anyone else had similar experiences, And what it turned out to be or if it jsht happens to be from the sinusitis. also I? do have arthritis in my lower back but I? visit chiropractors and take physically therapy too manage the pain, I’m 19.So about 12 days ago, I? got a headache on my right side that was close too my temples and the top of my forehead but every once in a while I’d feel a throb on the left side as well, as if someone was sliding it across my forehead. and I? do have a family history of migraines and I’ve had them here and there so I? wasn’t too concerned.

Headache,Headache for a year that isn't going away ,"So this is going to be lengthy so beware….So I am a 16 year old female who has been dealing with a constant headache for over a year now. So how it started was back in November of 2016 I started to get chest pains, and me having extreme anxiety thought I had breast cancer, so I ended up going to the doctor where he says it is just heartburns but just in case I will send you for a chest x-ray. Later a doctor gave me constipation medicine because it was because I was constipated that was giving me the chest pains. SO after that I started to get an increase of gas and my stools weren’t proper but I didn’t realize that. Now going into December a week before my headaches start I have an intense pain that strikes for 5 minutes in my jaw. I was at school and was shocked so I ate some Advil and it went away. Then a week after a day before my headaches started, my jaw again had an increase of pain and my neck and shoulders were killing me. I have always had a bad neck and shoulders after I was in an car accident in 2013, so I just thought it was just neck pain, So I ate Aleve and went to sleep, when I woke up BAMM my amazing headachestarted that hasn’t went away and it has been a year. When I woke up my head was pounding, there as so much pressure in my head, and in the face of my head, I was dizzy, imbalanced, felt weird sensations in my head. I freaked out and ate painkillers which to my luck didn’t work and never have for this glorious headache. SO that’s when I starts going to my family doctors she thought it was a sinus infection-nope, she thought it was a cold-nope, then she started to do all these tests on my which where an eye test, sinus x-ray, a painkiller that didn’t work, blood work and everything was negative, so then she sent me to an allergy doctor which was in three months. At that point I was in January and the symptoms were still there. In February I end up going to the ER because I couldn’t take it anymore. The ER gave me a migraine shot, guess what it didn’t work. They then sent me to a neurologist which the appointment was in May so I had to wait 3 months. Then something crazy happened, in March one day my ear was itching really badly so I itch it really badly and the headache and all the symptoms went away, for three weeks. I was in shock I didn’t understand what happened. I went to the allegory doctor and he said oh it must have been viral because none of the symptoms are adding up to an allergy. After, the tree week the headache came back and it had the same symptoms, at that point I just waited out for the neurologist appointment. When we as the neurologist, he was like oh its tension headaches and told me some things to do that didn’t help. He also sent me for a MRI which was in 4 months. So I waited and my symptoms then changed again to a dull pain in my head that I can’t locate it it’s there the pain is now a 5 out of 10 which is manageable but irradiating. So I/ waited for my MRI which was in July and the MRI was clear. Then something else happened the headaches then went away for two week AGAIN! I did nothing, at that time I went to LA to see family. However I was severely constipated which then made me realize oh it might be a stomach issue I am having. I thought this because my digestive system still was out of whack. SO after the headache came back I went to work and investigated on my stomach. I went on diets gluten, low carb, ate vitamins, medication, and nothing has worked. Long story short the headaches are still there I don’t know what to do. My family doctor has given up on me. The headache has been getting worse. What do you guys think I should do? The headaches come don’t leave and then go by themselves for a short time. My parents think I am crazy but I am serious it’s never leaves. Any advice?"
Headache,Partner becomes ill after kissing / intimacy? - please help,"My girlfriend of 4 years becomes ill after we have french kissed. We don't live together & only see each other at weekends. The symptoms she suffers with are headache (like a band across the top of the head, left-right), eye ache, fatigue/lethargy. Basically, general malaise. The symptoms present themselves 12-24 hours after (or sometimes sooner) we've had intimate contact, but do clear within 24-36 hours later. She believes I may be a carrier of something which passes to her when we kiss (or have close facial contact), triggering her symptoms.We are both in our early 40s & have not experienced this with any previous relationships.Both of us have visited our GPs & undergone blood tests, but they were all clear.The best advice the GPs gave was for her to take painkillers after we'd been in contact.We stopped french kissing approx. 1 year ago to try & alleviate her symptoms. Whilst this has reduced her symptoms it's not great for our relationship!Can anyone offer any advice on what might be causing this & which type of medical professional may be able to help please?"
Headache,Very uncomfortable headache for the last 2 - 3 months: Please suggest some advice! ,"Hi, I am a 17 year old girl who has been experiencing very uncomfortable headaches for the past two to three months. After doing some research I believe they are tension headaches but am not completely sure and would really love some advice on how to relieve these headaches in the short term and prevent them in the long term. So here are some of the things I have been experiencing...- Very uncomfortable feeling near the occipital lobe, frontal lobe and around the sides, feels very tight and like a band squeezing my head. - Pain occasionally continues down the side of my face. - The headaches may be super bad for one week then be only mild another week. - They do not stop me from sleeping. - Pain sometimes gets worse when I look at screens but other times the screens can provide a good distraction from the headache. The headaches do not stop me from doing physical activity or continuing with my academic goals although they are very uncomfortable and do stop me from reaching my full potential. I do not get stressed about my school work (although I am a high achiever), but I have been experiencing anxiety about my headaches. Does this anxiety make the headaches worse? Are there any particular ways I can deal with it? Also not sure if these are important as well...- Two months ago had a swollen lymph node near the ear but swelling has since faded. - My head gets very hot during the day and heats up. - If I place a hand to the side of my head I can feel very distinguishable pounding of blood. I love reading and doing my best and these headaches are stopping me from enjoying these things, as well as participating fully in social and academic actives. If you do have any tips or have experienced these types of headaches before, please provide some relief techniques or the reasons why these headaches are occurring. Thank you so much for your help!Gen "
Headache,"Please help , no doctor seems to know whats wrong with me","Hi, and thank you in advance.I'm a 35 year old women .About a year ago I started to have these symptoms:- ear pressure.- tongue numbness .- right cheek numbness.- fatigue .All symptoms get worse with a lot of work ( bending over moving around a lot picking up around the house ...)I saw many doctors and specialists and this is what I did so far: - CT scan from neurologists discovered a growth in my brain wasn't sure if its a tumour or calcification ..refered me to a neurosurgeon - cat scan with and without die .. confirmed that it was calcification and said it had nothing to do with my symptoms cause of there location.These are only the last 2 specialists..I saw many other doctors and nothing .Once I was prescribed an antibiotic and that made me feel better for about a month and then it came back.I was given migraine medication and nothing .I was given gabapentin and imitrex nothing worked.

Headache,Headaches/dizzyness,"Hey all..! I'm just after some general advice, or if anyone has been in a similar situation. I wasnt sure which group fit my symptoms best, so I thought perhaps this could be good - as headaches are kind of sometimes resulting in similar symptoms. I'd just like to firstly say that this isn't stressing me too much. I'm trying to be practical! So, my symptoms. I am a 30 year old guy, been pretty healthy. Not overweight, no injuries, eat well, exercise 1-2 hours walking per day etc. Not a stressful job - I'm a tour guide. All these symptoms started only around 5/6 days ago.So, firstly, I feel like I am walking on a trampoline. very strange sensation. I also have slight ringing in my earsAnd visually, my eyesight has changed a bit. I feel like I'm looking through an old tv when it has lost signal - everything is slightly pixelated. I'm also more sensitive to light - I have an impression of shapes for a few seconds of things I have just looked at, particularly in a darkened room. Sometimes if I look at a white wall, it will turn a little yellowy/black, and it will start to ""wave"" - like the sea.I also have brain fog, and I cant formulate sentences sometimes co-herrently. Although I think that I think okay..! My legs also feel a little weak sometimes.I do have a little shoulder/neck pain.I have had a little jaw pain from biting my teeth, but nothing too bad. The muscles in my cheeks were twitching a couple of weeks ago, and it was hurting a little more then. But it really isnt too bad now. Has anyone had similar symptoms/been medically diagnosed with anything? I've been to the doctors a few times, but they keep saying ""maybe you're stressed"", and one nurse recommended that I went for physiotherapy on my neck/shoulders - as it could be coming from that. I did also visit a neuralgic doctor, she did all sorts of tests etc, and she seemed 100% convinced that it was NOT neuralgic. I've also had a CT scan done of the brain/skull - everything was fine there, and a xray of my neck - nothing was displaced/irregular in terms of bones. Any helpers or hints at where I could go/what i should do next would be appreciated!I'm not driving at the moment due to this, and I feel generally a little uncomfortable with my eyesight issues. Apart from that I'm a firm believer of ""belief"".. but only to a point! Thanks anyone/everyone in advance! "
Headache,Headache for 3 weeks,"Hello,I've been suffering head pressure and a headache ever since 2 days before new years eve. I've tried ibuprofen, excederin, Tylenol and nothing seems to help. I ended up going to the ER for a CT scan that came back normal and the only finding was a 16mm sphenoid cyst on the right. Dr said he thinks I have tension headaches. But I constantly have head pressure, like someone is sitting on my forehead and I had two episodes of vertigo so I'm not sure if that's normal for tension headaches. The pressure gets so bad that my ears pop, I can hear my heartbeat in my left ear, and then my neck gets stiff and hurts. I'm not sure what else to do. Any thoughts on what this could be or anyone else experiencing this? It's making it hard to concentrate while working and sometimes hard falling asleep.

Headache,"Debilitating, constant head sensation - uncomfortable concentrating for 8 weeks","Hello,Fairly fit and active M/33 here. I have been experiencing a number of symptoms for 8 weeks now that started after a night out where I ate a fair amount of food and drink a few pints of beer (nothing unusual for me).The main debillitating symptom is a constant, dull, uncomfortable sensation in the left side of my head, and this I feel either at my neck or behind my eye or in between. I feel this from the moment I regain full consciousness from waking up (feels like blood or electric rushing to an area in my head), to when I go to sleep. It feels like there is an increase in head pressure.This thing that sets this apart from other people's accounts on this forum is the following. When I am doing nothing, it is bearable. If I try to concentrate, the feeling intensifies. This can be anything from watching tv, reading a book or emails, trying to listen to music, being in a noisy crowd - the more 'facts' or new information in the content/movement, the more uncomfortable it feels, usually to the point were I have to stop/withdraw myself. I usually end up feeling uneasy and with a headache. It feels like I have an extremely low tolerance to stress and/or new information. I would imagine that playing a computer game would be impossible. Composing this forum post has been difficult.When this started, the intensity was low but reached is peak 5 days later where even a few seconds of watching tv was unbearable. 2 weeks later, the intensity reduced, but I haven't felt much improvement since.Other symptoms I have (these are bearable/manageable):Constant tinnitus in right ear and bouts in leftFractured sleepNeed to urinate soon after drinkingSensitivity to loud/high pitched noiseDepersonalisationSocial withdrawalSymptoms I have recovered from thus far:Panic in headPalpitationsFeeling of difficulty breathing as I try to fall asleepCold hands and feetLoss of apititeI find that keeping physically busy takes my mind off the symptom like cleaning, hoovering and having a gym work out. Being a passenger in train/bus/car journeys are now bearable. I cannot drive my car comfortably, so have not made any car journeys alone since. I am unable to work (in IT). My quality of life now is restricted and poor compared to before.I have had a blood test (clear), brain MRI (clear) and have been to see a neurologist who administered an occipital nerve block, but that made no difference - may have made it worse. I am at loss as to what is causing my symptoms and what my outlook is. My gp says to just rest. I am wondering if anyone else is or has experienced this and if they ever got a formal diagnosis of this. I would much appreciate anyone's account of their experience. Many thanks for reading."
Headache,"6 weeks headaches, feeling helpless","I have been suffering from intermittent headaches for 6 weeks. They have been mild headaches predominantly in the temple and occasionally back of the head and haven’t been distracting from my daily activities, the problem is I can’t deal with them which is unusual for me. Usually when I get a headache, as we all do, I’ll take paracetamol and within a couple of hours they are gone. Over the course of the 6 weeks the other two most prominent symptoms has been feeling a pulse in my head, not necessarily when I have a headache and more noticeable when I lie down and consistent nausea. From about 3 weeks I began suffering from neck ache/stiff neck which has developed into neck pain and more recently I have developed aching and weakness in my left wrist and ankle. Having heard a loud, high pitched noise in my head a week ago which I can only describe as something in between a bird chirping and a phone ringing my left ear has been blocked and I have now developed flu like symptoms as well as regularly tasting blood in my mouth. After seeing numerous doctors/consultants nobody seems unduly concerned and have put it down to things from a virus, to tension headaches to a reccurance from disclocating my right shoulder (ac joint) 4 months ago. I have been really worried for a number of weeks that I may have a tumour and seem to have been ticking off a number of potential symptoms, yet no doctor seems the need to do a scan. The symptoms aren’t budging and I’m feeling pretty helpless!"
Headache,Do I have a brain tumour? Can someone put my mind at ease?,"I’ve never experienced headaches before. 3 months ago, I started getting headaches so bad that I would cry. They would start when I woke up and go until I fell asleep. Nothing soothed them. Water, pain killers, natural oils ect. I thought maybe I had a sinus infection, which I treated and the headaches never went away. I’ve been montitoring my diet, my sleep schedule, what I’m doing ect. They start the second I wake up, they’re so severe. It both my temples. Hurts more when I lay down, or bend over. Sound is a huge factor. The smallest noise causes so much extra pain. Lately the headaches have been so bad. Light doesn’t bother me/darkness doesn’t relieve any pain. Nothing relieves all the pain. I have no idea what’s wrong with me. I’m onky 20, so I’m really really scared. The pain doesn’t ease up at any point in the day. It’s just constant tight heavy pain in my temples all day every single day. What could this be?????? "

Headache,I'm 14 years old and suffer from Chromic cluster headaches.,"I'm a 14 year old girl from england and i have experianced chromic cluster headaches since the ages of 6. This is my first time doing something like this, and i have never spoken to anyone with the same condition as me.When i was younger i used to experiace a hurendous pain my my head my friends just said it was a headace so i tried to carry on with my day but no matter what i couldnt get rid of it, I'm not the kind of person who takes pain killers i just like to fight out the pain usally, cause i don't want my body getting to attached to them, but this time i couldn't bear it i took some pain killers but they didn't work evey time i said i had a headache my mum would just say 'oh take some painkillers and it will go away' but they never did. I never really told anyone about my headaches because i just thought they were normal, because i was only small. As i have grown up they have gotten worse, i now get from arround 8-15 cluster headaches [b:531749f46f] a day [/b:531749f46f] and there was nothing i could do about it so last august i told my mum about them to see if they were normal and she said i should take painkillers wherever i go just incase but my nana being the worry guts she is told me to go to the doctors, so i did and luckily i my GP is a headache specialist and diagnosed me with [i:531749f46f]Chronic[/i:531749f46f] cluster headaches straight away, she said sometimes theycan get confused with migraines and they dont respond to pain killers. So she put me on medication and it doesn't seam to work, it cuts them down so i have from about 5-7 a day insted of the amount i was having before but they dont compltely cut them off. As im writing this i have a headache and i can't think straight. I'm still coming to terms with the fact i am ill, i'm the kind of person that just likes to be the same as everyone else and get treated the same but that's never going to happen and i just have to learn to accept that, but i have such a rare condition that havent spoken to [u:531749f46f]anyone[/u:531749f46f] who's had cluster headaches before, and i just want to have someone to talk to at the end of the day who knows what im going through. 9 months since i was diagnosed i still haven't spoken to anyone. If you have cluster headaches and feel you are alone, please contact me at anytime, i would be happy to talk.

Headache,Desperate for answers!,"Hi guysSo for about 10 weeks now I've had head aches at the back of my head (in the dipped in part), and also at the top of my forehead, I also have a lot of pain in my neck and some in my shoulders too.I have no sinus symptoms and have recently had an MRI/MRA of my brain and neck. He said it's all good, so now I'm at a total loss with the headaches and neck pain.

Headache,headaches only after sleeping,"I get an occipital headache almost every night-- it usually wakes me up with a stabbing pain @ 2-4 a.m. I've tried different pillows, different sleep positions...can't seem to get the right answer. Much of it has to do with how much I irritate the muscle during the day, but it only manifests at night. Can someone please, please help me; the triptans I'm taking are slowly killing me.

Headache,"Weird fuzzy pressure, headaches","For about two or three weeks now, I've had a feeling of fuzzy pressure in my head. It doesn't tingle, but it feels like my skull is stuffed with cotton. It's almost akin to wearing a wrap-around headband that's just a little bit too tight. Sometimes it's light and other times it's heavy, but it's on and off throughout the day, and sometimes it develops into a headache later in the day.I have severe anxiety, so of course my immediate thought was ""brain tumor, you're going to die dude"" and that's really not helping me. I've been cleared by doctors multiple times for digestive problems that felt very very real to me, so it's entirely possible this could be a similar, self-made issue. I keep my hair in a ponytail usually, and taking it out seems to alleviate the pressure a bit, the same with taking off my glasses that slightly press into my temples. I'm not sure if that is really fixing the problem or just making me feel like I've fixed it, but it's certainly doing something, to a degree. The same with straightening my back out when I'm on the computer, since I have to bend my neck downward to look at the screen properly.Any ideas what this could be? I've had headaches on the regular all my life so getting them now is really no big deal, but with all the medical stuff I've been dealing with, I really want to make sure nothing is really wrong with me lest I stew in my own uncontrolled anxiety and make the ""symptoms"" worse than they otherwise would be."
Headache,Headache for 3 weeks ,Hi all I am 40 year old male. Around 3 weeks ago I had sharp pain in my right temple that lasted a few seconds. This has carried on at random times of the day. Maybe once or twice a day. In the right temple The next symptom I experienced was pressure behind my right eyed which comes and goes. The occasional pressure in my temple is there daily and then sometimes in the top of my head - sure I have cheekbone discomfort too but think I am imagining that!!! These headache does sometimes go to back of my head. And my neck does creek. I know I have bad posture as in front of pc all day - can posture cause all this? I am not clumsy. I do not feel nauseous with these headaches but they are just constant. It does not prevent me from doing anything. As far as I see nothing makes them worse - nor better unfortunately The neurologist said he was not concerned and did kind of blame it on thyroid medicine - I am underactive on 75mg if Levothyroxine. I have been schedules another neuro appointment but that won’t be this side of xmas. Can anyone help? Or offer any advice to stop these! 
Headache,"Daily headaches, balance issues, depression","Hello guys, I really need some help as I have no idea what to do. For the last two years I have been waking up with headaches. Deep dull throbbing pain in my sinuses and around my eyes, also on my templates. It feels like my head is in a vice at times. I have developed huge black bags under my eyes recently, I have a lot of fatigue (daily) and balance issues / general brain fog and vision problems. It's making me really depressed as I just can't get relief from the pain. The last week I have vomited everymorning but it's don't nothing for the pain (assuming it can't be a migraine?)Now an ENT is confident it's not a sinus issues although with the headaches I have postnasal drip all day everyday as well and sinus pain. There is no real cause for the drip that can be found. I have no idea what to do. My headaches are sevre in the mornings and get better todwards the evening, only for the whole process to start again. I have been under a lot of stress and do suffer with anxiety. Can this surely all still be anxiety?"

Headache,Post concussion syndrome,"Hello everyone, my names andy & just 5 days ago I banged my head quite badly on a metal display case whilst out with a friend shopping. The corner of the case caught my head quite sharply however there was no bleeding. From how painful it was I expected to get migraine symptoms like the flashing blur across my vision etc. However that didn't happen, I just got pain in the area of the injury.Now the reason I'm posting this is because even after a few days my head still hurts quite badly. I went to my doctors surgery today & told him the whole story. He had a feel of my head & said I hadn't fractured or dented my skull. He said it was good that I wasn't knocked out when the accident happened & its good that I haven't been vomiting. He got out one of those little torch things and tested my eyes which he said were responding normally to light & he checked my blood pressure which was fine. Also the fact that I was able to walk to the doctors surgery all by myself without getting lost or falling over was a good thing.So I have no ""red flag"" symptoms, I started to worry that I had bleeding on the brain or something crazy like that but apparently I'm good.The doctor said he thinks I have something called Post Concussion Syndrome? I had never heard of it. I have been put on a course of Codeine tablets, 4 a day. (I've only had one so far, so I haven't really felt any better yet.)My doctor guessed that my headache should go within a few days of taking my Codeine, but like always I got home & decided to google the damned thing. I found a lot of sites saying that this post concussion syndrome can last months, possibly a year or two!?!? ...I'm sorry I can't have that. I am only a few weeks away from returning to work after a long battle with my IBD & I can't bear the thought of having a constant headache for so long.If anyone has had this problem please share your experiences & perhaps lend some reassurance my way. I know I should just take onboard what my doctor said, but its too late now I have google-itis thanks,Andy"
Headache,Headache for 8 days,"Hi.I've had a headache now for 8 days. Not continuous pain but its still there.Painkillers do help but have not completely eased the pain for me to know the headache has goneI have tried paracetamol with Codine, paracetamol and aspirin, ibuprofen and just aspirin on its own. Aspirin seems to be the most effective. I'm getting fairly good sleep, 8 hours a night.To add, I have high blood pressure controlled with medication which I have been on for a number of years. Taking ibrupofen is something I should only do for a day or so. (not that I find it effective anyway)I was recently suffering with some anxiety but feel ok about stuff at the moment. (good 3 months ago)One thing I have noticed is that at the base of my skull at the top of my neck my pressure points feel quite tender (just in line with the Botton of my ears). Is that normal?I'm sure my headaches are nothing sinister but going on eight days is concerning me.I have always been someone who would get a few headaches every week which OTCpainkillers would normally sort out.I'm hoping to get to the doctors in the next day of so.Just wondered if this is just a standard tension headache and if anyone has suffered anything similar and what they did to resolve it.Thanks.

Headache,Extreme headache and neck pain and stiffness from past 5-6 years,"I am a 23 year old male from Mumbai, India.This is a long post, but I am in great suffering. I have been having really bad headaches for a long time (5+ years) and they have been getting worse. I desperately need help, and even after having done MRI and X-Ray, the doctors couldn't find the problem and the general consensus is I have migraine. I have been given medications like Migarid, Naprosyn, Oxidon, Nervup and Zymoflann. They do relieve my headaches a bit, but my problem is not just limited to headaches.Every morning, I wake up with a stiff and painful neck. Soon, I will have a bad headache usually localised to one side and in the temporal area, but then spreads throughtout. As the day progresses, the pain gradually spreads all over my upper body, and I can barely move my neck. The place that hurts most are two points on the base of the skull, some points on my neck and the shoulder. The pain is extreme, and I cannot open my eyes or even sit up. This happens everyday, for more than 5 years. I always have had tinnitus. I have visited the ENT and they confirmed that it was tinnitus (not objective), and had my middle ear checked which came out clear (no problems in middle ear). The static ringing in my ears becomes even louder during my headaches, coupled with a whooshing/sound and pressure; so much that it drowns the outside noise to a great extent.I also find that I am unable to think clearly. I feel my memory is abysmal, and I cannot study anymore no matter how hard I try. There is too much confusion/issues with concentration. At random points in the day, I have a hot cold feeling, especially during a headache. I cannot tolerate loud noise, light, music, cannot laugh, cry, or get excited, since it induces a terrible headache. My muscles fatigue very quickly, and I feel that I have very high sensitivity to pain.My neck feels really really stiff, and becomes really painful during a headache. Also, when I have a headache (or when I become excited/anxious), my stomach becomes upset and I pass excessive amounts of gas. I have observed that my muscles get quickly sore when I used to workout. I wake up every morning tired and my neck extremely sore and in pain.My grades are low, I have trouble remembering things, and at this point, I feel like I have become a ""vegetable"" that cannot do anything apart from confined to the bed because of the pain. I feel like a very disabled person now. I am becoming more depressed day by day, and I really, really need help urgently.Here are some of my details-Age - 23; Height - 5'8""; Weight - 150 lbs; Race - Indian; Habits - Non-smoker, non-alcoholic, rarely drink coffee; Deficiencies - Had a slight deficiency of Vitamin B12 and Vitamin D earlier; Sleep - 6-7 hours daily. Sleeping more than that may result in headaches. Taking naps at noon results in headaches. I sleep on my back, since sleeping in any other position guarantees a very sore neck and upper back the next morning and multiple days of continuous headache.I have visited countless doctors in India regarding my condition. I have had scans and tests which came out clear. I really don't know what else to do know, and would really appreciate if someone has any idea about what is going on."
Headache,My headaches cured!! ??,"Hi all, just wanted to share this as it could hopefully help someone. I have found out that being low in magnesium and b vitamins can cause headaches so started using flax seed which has iron, magnesium and other beneficial minerals etc. Just sprinkle it on cereal, salads, stews, anything basically. My headaches have stopped, something so easy. Taking medication for headches etc can cause this deficiency so it's compounding the problem. Hope this helps some one. Good luck. "
Headache,I feel there's something wrong with my head.,"Hello. I don't really know what to do or how to solidify a google search for my symptoms so I figured this may be my best bet. I am 18. So I have struggled with anxiety/depression since I was young due to being molested by my neighbor. This particular incident F'd me up for a while and the only reason I am including such information is in case of a possible connection to PTSD with my issue since I have been working through this subject in therapy. Basically, my symptoms are all over my body but now that they are strting to hurt my head I am concerned. Some odd things that have been happening to me for years/months are: hands and feet turning purple and numb, loss of appetite, extreme back and neck pain (it feels both muscular and skeletal in pain). For a few months now I have been feeling EXTREMELY depressed and anxious, to the point where i cry out of frustration at least once a day over it. I feel extremely disconnected from my life and the world around me. For the times when I am actually awake and mentally present, I harbor alot of anger and frustration. I have no reason to be upset, I am more than okay with all aspects of my life and if there are things I am not ok with I have already learned to accept them. However, I have been experiencing extreme heachaches that over power my entire head. I get tingling sensations on the top and towards the back side of my brain. When I stand it gets extremely painful to the point where I CAN'T stand. It feels like my entire brain is expanding and pushing against my skull. All I can do is squeeze my eyes and wait for it to pass. But my entire head feels negative. I don't know how to clearly explain it but it makes me want to crawl out of my skin because my entire head feels encapsulated in negativity (Not in thoughts, but as in physical harm).Also I am experiencing sleeping problems with sleep paralysis and everything that has to do with it. I am completely afraid to sleep alone at this point. I sleep with my boyfriend every night and if he isnt home I have to sleep on the floor of a family member.I feel terrible, miserble, and crazy and I know I shouldn't be feeling any of this as I am usually a smart, healthy, and vibrant person. However due to all of this I only can manage to do the bare minimum in school and work because It feels as if I can't push my brain that far. Any insight is more than appreciated. "
Headache,"Annoying, daily headache for 2 weeks now. Need help","I've been having headaches every day for 2 weeks now. They start in the back, right portion of my head and spread on the whole other right side of my head and into my right eye. They used to start immediately when I woke up and last all day but now they don't start until the end of the day and they spread all around my head. The only other symptoms I have is occasional auras and neck stiffness.I can't see a doctor about it because I have no money, but however, I did get an MRI about 9 months ago. All the findings were normal. No tumors or aneurysms so unless one of those developed after the MRI, I shouldn't have one. Any advice would be helpful, thanks"

Headache,Any advise on MRI Scans for the brain.,"Not sure if im posting in the right group, fairly new to all this..Im having a MRI scan in my head on the 13th.

Headache,A headache that won't go away,"Hi everyone,I've been having this headache for over a month now and I'm really worried. From what I researched it seems to be a migraine. It's a pressure feeling on the right side of my head (around the temple) and it feels like a vain or artery will explode at any time. I'm scared to death it could be something bad!The pain varies a lot. Sometimes it's very strong and sometimes it's almost nonexistent, but it's always there. I can feel it. I miss 'feeling normal' again... SHOULD I BE WORRIED or is this a somewhat regular occurrence?I went to the doctor twice and they assumed it was sinusitis and prescribed me some medicine. Neither of them worked. Just a couple of points now so that you guys can help me better:* I had this same headache about 3 months ago for the first time. It lasted for a week and then went away. Now it came back and is with me for over a month. * I work as a night guard so I get irregular sleep. Sometimes I take naps at work and then when I get home at 6 am I sleep until 10:30 to 11:00 am. (But I've had this job for 2 years and never had this type of headache... so I don't know...)* With my current girlfriend I have had some erection problems... It's 100% psychologically. I know it. But to get my confidence back I took some erectile dysfunction pills. (Sildenafil mainly and tadalafil). But I took a quarter of the recommended dosage and it worked. I still take it a couple of times a week, but I'm trying to get rid of it. It could be it? I don't think so... but anyway...What do you guys think? Should I be worried? Help me!"

Headache,"Pain in the left side of head, fuzzy Ness like dizzy but not spinning, nausea....anyone else..??? ","Hi, September last year 2016 I started getting a headache everyday in the left side of my head with brain fog/dizziness...doctor referred me to a neurologist. I had a mri scan on my head all come back normal. He then gave me tablets for the headaches. They helped. Then all of a sudden after months of this brain fog and headaches it all went. Now 3 weeks ago...it all started again ? brain fog, pain on the top left side of my head by my temple, nausea, feeling tired like my eye's are so heavy...it's all getting me down again. I've been back and forth to the doctors again and they are putting it down to anxiety. Had a complete blood count...had a liver function test...as the whites of my eyes are a little off colour like a yellow colour...all bloods come back normal. This brain fog/dizziness is really getting me down I've had it for nearly 4 week's everyday none stop ?? I've had a ecg done all normal..cholesterol 3.5 considered normal. I'm a 28 year old female. I wondered if anybody at all has the same symptoms or know of anything to get rid of the brain fog and dizziness. I'm missing out on so much time with my children because I feel so ill all the time.Doctors won't take me seriously because they think it's anxiety.

Headache,Pressure in head for 10+ days,"Hello all, I've been experiencing a strange series of feelings in my head for the last 10 days. Its been a bit of a ride so far and frankly I want to get off.I had a few normal headaches around my birthday which was 22nd August but I got on top of them with regular paracetamol. It was then by the 26th August that I had a pressure in my head that was pretty much stuck in my right temple, felt kinda weird but I wouldn't say it ""hurt"" per se. On Sunday 27th I felt the pressure behind my right eye on and off. At this point I was not taking anymore paracetamol because I was busy with things and just assumed it would go away with rest and drinking water.So we get to Monday 28th August and my head feels super weird, the pressure was radiating from the front to the back of my head all on the right side, never straying into the left side of my head though. There were twangs of pain but it still felt more like pressure than pain.I ended up in the doctors office after a poor nights sleep and a heavy dose of worrying.The doc listened to my story and concluded that I was experiencing a ""migraine without aura"". She inspected my eyes with a torch thingy and lightly touched around my head with her hands. Doc got it out of me that I was worried about the possibility that I could have a brain tumor and she asked me a series of questions like, Have I been vomiting? Have I been blacking out? Am I losing my memory or vision or hearing? To all of these I answered no. Doc then said that these are all red flag symptoms so I should not worry. She sent me home with pills called Sumatriptan(?). And I was told that I would know if these pills worked after one dose.So there I was that evening I took one of these new pills and nothing happened, but after the second one a couple hours later I got in bed to go to sleep and had a terrible night. I had a real legit pain bouncing around my head from both sides, front and back. i was miserable. Next day I went back to the doctors office with the weight of the world on my head.I saw a doc who I had actually met with before who remembered me from a past ailment which was reassuring. He heard me out and ended up doing a full blown check up. He took my blood pressure, my temperature, he had me do a series of exercises with my hands for my coordination or something, he turned off the lights and got out a torch for my eyes, and he felt all around my head and neck. All the while he was asking me questions without a breath in between so that i had no time to think about the answers.When he was finished he sat down across from me and said that my head problems were due to tension. So I obviously started asking questions. The whole ""migraine without aura"" was now debunked. This doctor who had met me before knew that I was a worrier so he went through the whole brain tumor possibility with me. He was pretty damn confident that I don't have one for the same reasons that I had been told the day before and he thought it was very unlikely that I would start to experience these red flag symptoms.I was somewhat reassured having had a full check up and a rather comprehensive discussion about everything. I was told to go home and take co-codamol ""for a week or so"" that was my doctors words, and to work on relaxation techniques, maybe use a heat pack on my neck or take hot showers or baths.From that evening when I got home, which was Friday 1st September, I have been taking 2 co-codamol about every 4 hours everyday. I have done my best to try and relax and be optimistic, I have also stayed off the internet looking for answers. I am still worried though deep down. My head has gone back to feeling like I have a concentrated pressure above and a little behind my right ear, sort of to the right of the back of my head. Its as if someone is pressing on my head in that spot. I have noticed a few times now and then that I will struggle to think of the word i mean to say, but that could be because I am so distracted by my head. I also have floaters in my eyes but i have had these for years. A few times I have had a sudden ringing in one of my ears but i have heard this in both ears at different times, but this could also be because of how much i listen to music at a loud volume.....Yesterday; 3rd September, I woke up and felt as if my head was better, I was happy to feel like this suddenly, until I got up and started to do things to find that my head was still mad with me. I am still taking co-codamol every four hours but it doesnt seem to actually do much. I am keeping hydrated as much as i can and I am still eating albeit not as much as i normally do, which is a classic trait of mine when I am nervous and worried.This morning (4th September) I felt as though my head was ok when i initially woke up, just a bit delicate maybe, but as i got up and had breakfast my head is definitely still feeling weird. I have that pressure at the back right side of my head, I wouldn't say it hurts, just pressure. I'm on my first co-codamol of the day, gonna have my second dose soon. I'm not sure wether or not to go back to my doctor or try to soldier on and see what happens..... "
Headache,Morning Headaches,"Hi, I'm a 30 yr old woman and I wondered if anyone is suffering similar headaches and what they have done to try and combat them. For the past few months Im being awoken from sleep in the morning with a severe headache this is predominantly in the side of my head (whichever side I was sleeping on) the degree of severity heightens the more I have slept. Once I get up the pain moves and feels like a crushing weight on the top of my skull along with pain at the base of my skull with my neck and down my spine to about my shoulder blades feels stiff and aches. Gradually my spine and neck pain/stiffness wear off and the headache lessens to a bearable level after an hour or so. Sometime I can have the head pain for several hours even after pain killers and adequate hydration. This is becoming the norm but I feel constantly exhausted by the headaches and long to wake up with no pain in my head. Is there anything I can do to prevent these headaches or any tips on how to alleviate the symptoms more efficiently and effectively. Thankyou.Hi, I'm a 30 yr old woman and I wondered if anyone is suffering similar headaches and what they have done to try and combat them.

Headache,Wierd eye symptoms and others,"Hello, I've been struggling with some symptoms for years now. I've been going to the doctors for years, but nothing has ever been found except coeliac disease. I am completely gluten free now. One of the most annoying is my eye symptoms. When I (try to) look in the mirror, it's like I can't see my full face. My eyes just can't take it in all at once. It only looks at one point like each eye at once or nose or just in between my eyes. I was perfectly normal before. With reading words, it can't take in the whole word just like one letter. I can't see the whole tv either, like my eyes just see one person, not the whole part together. It's like my eyes are stuck or always staring, it's so hard to describe. My optician said your eyes look fine. It affects my reading really badly. I have other symptoms too, like trouble thinking. Any suggestions or input will be appreciated. Thank you btw I'm only 20 i put it in the headache group bcause when I try to think normally my head starts hurting. Hello, I've been struggling with some symptoms for years now.

Headache,Consistent Headache for 2 months now!,"So I've been experiencing a headache every day for the last 2 months. It is always on the left side of my head and can become excrutiatingly painful. It isn't there all day, but I'd say 75% of the day it is. I have become confused in trying to process words and sentences recently, as well as feeling dizzy when I wake up and having weakness and numbness/pins and needles in my left arm and leg. This has been going on for a while now and I'm extremely concerned I have a brain tumor. My symptoms match up and I'm just so worried. I'm going to the neurologist in September but can't help but think I need an MRI scan right now and may as well start chemo now.This is all causing extreme health anxiety and I can't help it because my symptoms happen every day.Any help or advice please? I'm literally so worried I've had to take time off work because of it.Thanks"
Headache,Constant headache :(,"About six months ago I began to feel a bit spaced out (detached from reality) and I went to see the doctor about it.

Headache,Working Night Shift And Getting Headaches,"Hello All,I started working on the night shift back in November. (About 3 months now) The first few weeks were normal but then I started getting headaches. Also it would get harder and harder to sleep. I started taking melatonin 3mg and that has helped with my sleep alot thank god on the days that I work. However when it comes time for my days off (2 days off consecutively) I tend to get headaches when I go to sleep at night and wake up in the morning. Most times its on the right side of my head, temples. Sometimes it travels to the left or top of my head. I went to a neurologist and due to my blood pressure past she ruled it out to that being the reason. However my blood pressure has now been regulated and I still get them.Long story short during the days I work i dont get headaches and using melatonin I can sleep. During the days im off I try not to use melatonin and I get headaches either when I wake up or later on through the day. Does anyone have any advice on what it could be? I go for an MRI in a few weeks so I can rule out any serious conditions. Anything will help I just want to have peace of mind that this isnt anything life threatening."
Headache,Worried about headaches ,"Hi all,I'm a nineteen-year-old girl, and I've been experiencing headaches for over a week now. The first morning, a throbbing headache woke me up - it throbbed right at the back of my skull, and the pain was severe. However, I started my period that day, so I attributed it to hormones. However, I've finished my period now, and I'm still getting them. The symptoms are as follows: - I always wake up with one. It's dull, and it doesn't wake me, but I'm aware it's there.- It's off-and-on. I'll get it at least four times a day for around half an hour. - It's at the back of my head, and feels dull and achy. Often my head feels tight. Sometimes it moves around my head, like my scalp is being pulled, or something. Sometimes it feels toothachy in my temples. I must add that I have Generalised Anxiety Disorder, so it could be that, because sometimes my neck aches, too. But I'm honestly terrified I have a brain tumour. if I think about it too much, I feel nauseous and dizzy - and I know these are both symptoms of anxiety and a tumour. I suppose I just need reassurance, or a way to combat them - when I think I feel calm, they'll sometimes come on. I don't know whether it's just subconscious stress, or what.... "
Headache,Cluster headaches/ migraines ,"Hi , for years I've had really bad headaches which could only be relieved by migraine tablets. I've not had any flashing lights or light aversion etc that migraine suffers experience. Recently these attacks have come in clusters , I'd have one then take sumatriptan which would get rid of it only to return a few hours later and this usually happens 3/4 times over a couple of days. This can go on 2/3 times a month . My doctor now thinks these aren't migraines but cluster headaches. This week has been the worst as the headache started on Monday morning and has been recurring from then. At the moment the pain is quite intense but as I've had more sumatriptan than I should have I darent take any more! Do any of you suffer like this or know someone who does?

Headache,headache with visual problems ,since yesterday ive been having some visual problems where my vision is blurry and i see sort of black spots pulsating and it's sort of narrowed? i looked it up and some people described it as like looking through a kaleidoscope or heat wave like images. and i remember after seeing this i got up and suddenly felt really dizzy. then my arm got really weak?? i could still move it normally it just felt weak and i think it might have just been bc i was drawing for many hours and my hand got tired. it went away that night and now i'm currently feeling these symptoms again but this time i got a headache. it's very hard to keep my eyes open rn and the light hurts my eyes. should i be worried or could this just be another thing anxiety is causing? since yesterday ive been having some visual problems where my vision is blurry and i see sort of black spots pulsating and it's sort of narrowed? i looked it up and some people described it as like looking through a kaleidoscope or heat wave like images. and i remember after seeing this i got up and suddenly felt really dizzy. then my arm got really weak?? i could still move it normally it just felt weak and i think it might have just been bc i was drawing for many hours and my hand got tired. it went away that night and now i'm currently feeling these symptoms again but this time i got a headache. it's very hard to keep my eyes open rn and the light hurts my eyes. should i be worried or could this just be another thing anxiety is causing? 
Headache,Head pressure meditation ,"Hi everyone, I was foolish enough to think and believe in things that I saw in media that meditation is good so I developed habit to meditate using guided meditations on youtube for over a year ,maybe more. In the beginning I was really feeling good and had nice results from my practice and then strong head pressure occurred and remains in my head for nine months.I am absolutely certain that is consequence of meditation , I came across hundreds of people suffering same problems of meditation on internet . The problem is that if I go to forums where are people who meditate and share same problems I get mystical explanations like purifying chakras but I really have to find way out of this.You can’t even imagine what have I tried. I did various medical checks such as MRI and EGG which turned out to be fine.I also visited many neurologists, I even spoke with guy who was candidate for Nobel prize in neurosciences who told me that this is no consequence of meditation and that I should reduce stress. I have been to chiropractic, craniosacral therapy three times, acupuncture, Reiki, massages you name it . I started with Qigong classes , I can't even remember what else this I tried.. I went also to psychiatrist well known one who first thought it was anxiety so she gave me pills for that that didn't work , second guess was that I am imagining it and she gave pills for psychosis which of course didn't work as well .Eventually she gave me antidepressants that didn't work as well and sent me to bioenergist who didn't help as well .Then I changed psychiatrist who change medicine and I went through hell , pills put me down and I was throwing up every morning and couldn't sleep. I gave up on that and started Ayurveda medicine that didn't work so I stopped that as well. I recently met Russian millionaire who told me that he is owner of several clinics in Russian and that his daughter had suffered from migraines for seven years and they have been to various doctors from US to Japan and eventually Iranian guy here in Serbia helped her, next morning I was in his office. He gave me bunch of cocktails for 500 euros and I all I got was 3 kilos because his pills were full of vitamin B. Next is I am seeing guy who has developed machine based on Tesla's idea that measure frequency although I have been to quantum medicine with failure as well . The worst is that in moments of desperation my father took to shaman who told me that I am under magic , I never felt so stupid and humiliated in my life. Please help I don’t know what to do more"

Headache, Lumbar puncture headache ," Good afternoon. Two days ago I had a lumbar puncture performed by my neurologist. Procedure itself went off without a hitch. About an hour later I started having a really bad headache in the back of my head. It mostly went away when I laid down. I understand this is not uncommon. I was told to lay down, drink plenty of fluids, and take caffeine. Friday night I woke up in middle of the middle of the night in absolute agony - worst pain I ever felt in my life. Pain was shooting down the back of my neck into both of my arms. This lasted for about a half hour. Thankfully it eased up and I managed to fall asleep again. Saturday morning I felt somewhat better ( was able to stand up and go to the bathroom for the first time without pain), but by mid afternoon, I had to remain entirely in bed to avoid really bad headaches. Saturday night again I had a brief bout of insane pain. Sunday morning I felt well enough to actually take a shower, but again by mid afternoon, I find myself back in bed again, unable to stand up for more than a few seconds. The whole time I have been taking Tylenol and caffeine, which doesn't seem to be helping much. Each time I think I'm getting better, I end up relapsing. My neurologist said that if I don't feel better by Sunday night, I should consider going back to the emergency room, though she cautioned they're not going to run to do a blood patch so quickly. Is this something that can resolve itself on its own? I really would rather not have to go back to the hospital, but I don't know how much longer I can handle this pain. "
Headache,Too many doctors with no answers,"My headaches started around February and towards the beginning, I was continually diagnosed with a sinus infection by my PCP. I was given antibiotics for a week with no progress. I then went back and was given the strongest antibiotic they had for two weeks with still no relief. Then they gave me Prednisone for a week but I was only able to take it for a couple days before stopping due to the side effects. Since then the headache has been ever constant sometimes worse than others. I then went to an ENT who wanted a CT scan of the sinuses which showed a little swelling but nothing that he thought would cause the headache. I then went to a neurologist who wanted a CT of the Brain which showed nothing. Then I had an MRI which showed nothing. I'm currently taking Nortriptyline which is not helping in the slightest. My headaches seem to be closest in description to tension headaches but with an almost ever present lightheadedness sort of dizziness that has kept me from driving sense about April. I feel like I'm out of options because I am at a loss for answers.My headaches started around February and towards the beginning, I was continually diagnosed with a sinus infection by my PCP.

Headache,Persistent daily headache and other symptoms,"Hey everyone, I'm new here and I've been wanting to hear opinions regarding headaches. I'm a 25 yo woman, healthy, I don't smoke or drink. I remember having headaches ever since I was a kid, ever since always taking OTC meds trying to control it. Three years ago I had a CT scan that came back clear and the doctor started treating me for migraine. Ever since I took different kinds of meds but I've never been more than 2/3 days headache free. In the last months I've been having daily headaches, my exception is when I'm not in pain. A new neurologist explained how migraine works and how he hardly thinks my case is migraine related, as my headaches are often in the same spot and they happen everyday. I'm having other symptoms that I don't know if are somehow related, such as lots of heartburn, difficulty in finding some words when I'm speaking, fatique and sleeppiness, rapid hearbeat sometimes even when I'm resting, these are some that I can remember of - overall speaking, I don't feel well all the time, this symptoms are really having a direct impact in my everyday life, specially at work. I'm kind of afraid of what this pain can be. Now I have a MRI and a QEEG Brain Mapping. I'm curios to hear if any of you suffered something along these lines and if you have a diagnosis to share with me. "
Headache,Brain-Eating Amoeba?,"Okay, so let me get this outta the way - I AM a hypochondriac, lol. Unfortunately.On Sunday morning, I swam in my pool and got water up my nose. (It's a chlorinated pool, don't exactly know the Ph level though.)And my first thought was the fear of that brain-eating amoeba.And ever since then - I've been getting headaches. And they've been feeling worse and worse with each day.I've been having a low grade fever that comes and goes too.Today was the absolute worse though - I was grogg and the inside of my head felt like it was on fire.I haven't been vomiting, however. (I believe that was a symptom.)Anyways - I just need some help and comfort, yeah?I'll be making a visit to the doctor tomorrow, but I just need people's input on my current troubles.Is it the amoeba?A virus?Or just me?"

Headache,pornography & headaches,"Hello,I have been watching porn for about 18 months and then quit around 2 years ago. I remember the very last times I watched it I used to get a slight headache lasting 1-2h. All of a sudden, 6 months ago, I started having severe chronic headaches (similar to migraines) which are triggered just by having sexual thoughts. There must be something wrong in my brain which triggers these headaches every single time i am sexually excited. Have you ever heard about other people facing this issue? any treatment you can suggest?"
Headache,Headache everyday for a week+,"Hey everyone! I'm 24, I've been having a headache everyday since June 18th. My diet is on point, I'm fit, I sleep well and I and excercised regularly until I started getting headaches. I don't drink or smoke, I never even smoked once in my life. I'm a gamer and stay a lot in front of the PC.How it all started: I went to a gaming event nearby on the 18th, had to wake up early to catch the bus, slept only around 4hrs, didn't eat enough and I was walking around the event the entire day from like 8 AM to 7 PM. I ate some bad sandwich there and was in the WC for 20 mins. I didn't even use transport that much, I walked back home even when I was feeling terrible, I don't know why, I'm so dumb. I'm pretty sure I covered an insane distance.When I came home all my legs and arms were sore, my pulse was 100+ while lying down (usually its 60), had a terrible headache as if I was really drunk the night before and was feeling cold (I never feel cold). The day after that I still had that terrible headache, my pulse was almost back to my normal condition - 75 or so. I didn't stay on the computer at all these 2 days.The next day I was completely fine and since I was so confident with my physical condidition [I've been working out for 3-4 months now extensively (calisthenics + cardio) and I'm honestly pretty fit] I thought its a good idea to play 29 games in a row (that average 20 mins each). So I essentially played all day without much breaks. The game I play is really competitive and requires a lot of concentration since it's kind of like real time chess, so I stressed my brain probably even more than your average guy that just plays for fun. I got a terrible headache again and had trouble falling asleep.Since then I've had the same annoying mild headache every day. I'm really scared that I might've unlocked some condition. I know that what I did was retarded. I tend to overtrain from time to time, I overtrained like 3 times total in 4 months.I'm honestly super annoyed that I keep having to deal with stuff like this even though my diet is perfect, I excercise regularly and I don't drink or smoke... I read that these things can be genetic too, some people are more prone to it etc. I'm pretty sure it has to be that because I have friends that are super unhealthy and don't have to deal with that...It just feels so unfair to see friends or acquintances that go out partying every night, barely get any sleep, drink alcohol, smoke and have almost no problems while I have to deal with stuff like this time and time again even though I have an almost perfect lifestyle (besides staying in front of the PC too much)I'm thinking of going to my GP to ask about his thoughts on the matter but I've honestly lost faith in doctors. A few months ago I had problems with high pulse and I was prescribed betablockers and it took so much work to get rid of that poison and get in good shape on my own. I'm scared they will prescribe me some shXXXy medication that I will have to fight with again.Gaming has been my job for the last 5-6 years and I don't really have much else to fall back on. I'm also scared that I might have to give up on it cause honestly I don't think there's much else that I can change in regards to my diet, sleeping patterns etc. I even eat homegrown food. :DWhat should I even do ? Do I get some brain scans or what?Thanks for reading this wall of text ! I hope I wasn't too annoying. :D I'll put time in researching some of the threads here too.Moderator comment: I have edited this post due to the swearing. These are open forums so as per the T&Cs please do not use offensive language in posts otherwise they may be deleted."
Headache,Headaches for 8 months please help!,"Hi my name is Blair and I'm a junior in high school. At the beginning of this school year (September 11th to be exact), I started getting headaches. After about a week I told my mother and she took my to a walk in clinic. The dr told me I had a sinus infection which made sense because I also felt pressure in my face and had a stuffy nose. I took the medicine she prescribed for the 10 days but it did not help. I went to my pediatrician a week after and she prescribed me more medicine that did not help. Eventually (after being put on several other medicines that made me sick including an extremely high dosage of prednesone) my nose cleared up but my headache was still there. Since September I've had a headache every day at different intensities. I've gone to 4 pediatricians, 3 emergency rooms, an ENT, a dentist (I now have TMJ and have a bite guard for my teeth), Orthodontist, Eye Doctor, Chiropractor, and a neurologist. The chiropractor helped me a lot at first but now it seems like it's not doing much. I've had a CT scan that came out clean and just got an MRI and MRV done and am waiting for the result. I am not sure if I have chronic headaches or if there is something obvious that everyone's missing!! My headaches seem to stress from the back of my head and go to the front of it. My cheeks are also very sensitive and hurt often. Loud noise intensifies the pain too. There were many times were I couldn't get out of bed. Also, I am a long distance runner and was forced to stop running about 3 months ago because I was not able to function properly. My grades are slipping In school and I am having difficultly doing simple tasks and concentrating. Usually I am happy and full of energy but now I am exhausted, weak, and have anxiety. Please help me if you have any ideas or thoughts . Thank you guys so much!! -BlairHi my name is Blair and I'm a junior in high school. At the beginning of this school year (September 11th to be exact), I started getting headaches. After about a week I told my mother and she took my to a walk in clinic. The dr told me I had a sinus infection which made sense because I also felt pressure in my face and had a stuffy nose. I took the medicine she prescribed for the 10 days but it did not help. I went to my pediatrician a week after and she prescribed me more medicine that did not help. Eventually (after being put on several other medicines that made me sick including an extremely high dosage of prednesone) my nose cleared up but my headache was still there. Since September I've had a headache every day at different intensities. I've gone to 4 pediatricians, 3 emergency rooms, an ENT, a dentist (I now have TMJ and have a bite guard for my teeth), Orthodontist, Eye Doctor, Chiropractor, and a neurologist. The chiropractor helped me a lot at first but now it seems like it's not doing much. I've had a CT scan that came out clean and just got an MRI and MRV done and am waiting for the result. I am not sure if I have chronic headaches or if there is something obvious that everyone's missing!! My headaches seem to stress from the back of my head and go to the front of it. My cheeks are also very sensitive and hurt often. Loud noise intensifies the pain too. There were many times were I couldn't get out of bed.

Headache,"Occipital neuralgia headache, easing pain?","Hello, I apologize that this post is so long, but i wanted to give a little background for my issue. I really really appreciate any input anyone can give me!I have had horrible migraines for 10+ years which have become chronic daily headaches, manageable, but daily. A year ago I started having horrible pains at the base of my skull on the right side, some days it is a horrible stabbing pain, some days it is just a dull ache, but it is always there. I saw my neurologist in May about the pain since it just would not go away, she really had no ideas for me, she thought it might be a pinched nerve but said she really didn't know, she started me on nortriptyline, after being on the nortriptyline for 2 months and no change, she switched me to gabapentin, I am now taking 1200mg 3 times a day. Some days I notice a difference, other days no change at all. My Neurologist said to stay on it and it should be helping. About 3 months ago the same type of pain started on the left side of my neck, about 1.5 inches below the base of my skull, closer to the middle by the spinal cord than the outside of the neck, it felt like a muscle knot that wouldn't go away, for the first few weeks, thinking it was a muscle knot, I was trying everything to get the knot to go away, after no relief with heat, massage, ice, I saw my neurologist and basically demanded that we get an MRI to see what was going on, she said she didn't think that was necessary, but ordered it anyway. She said my MRI looked totally fine and that i should still stay on the gabapentin, but no more help than that. After that I decided to find a different doctor. I started seeing a physiatrist, specializing in neurologic issues. My first appointment with him was fantastic, right away he said from everything i am describing i have occipital neuralgia. He explained what it was, and that it is a tricky thing to get under control, and he really couldn't say what is causing it. He said that the gabapentin is what he would prescribe, and it probably is helping, just not taking the pain away totally. He did prescribe a cream to apply to my neck, that he said he has great results with. He said he likes to try this first before doing any injections. It is a special compound cream that is specially made at a pharmacy he uses, its a mix of baclofen, gabapentin, ketorolac, and lidocane. Its hard to tell if the cream is working, kind of like the gabapentin, sometimes it feels great, other times the pain is the same...My true issue and reason for posting is, I have had a bad headache on the right side of my head, it moves from the right base of my neck, around my ear to my front temple area. Throughout the day it is in a different spot and I can pinpoint exactly where it is, it feels like someone is stabbing a knife right in that area, but it lasts for hours, throughout the day it does get a little ""better"", but i can always feel it, when it gets ""better"" it just feels like a massive pressure in that area. I have been a headache sufferer for as long as i can remember, but this headache is different than any headache I've ever had, and it going on day 19. I have tried everything; my many different headache medications (including an injection i give myself), I've taken a dose pac of steroids along with come anti nausea medication my neurologist gave me, i have gone to get a DHE treatment from my neurologist, i have gotten a torodal shot, and pretty much anything else i could think of, and nothing is kicking this headache. After doing lots and lots of online research, it leads me to believe that this is related to my occipital neuralgia, not a ""normal"" headache. Has anyone has a headache like this before? Do you think it is related to the occipital neuralgia, or something else? Does anyone have any ideas to make it go away. Also, if anyone has any tips on dealing/treating neck pain from occipital neuralgia, i would appreciate that too!! I am just really hoping for some relief from this headache, more than just a few hours of it feeling ""better"". thank you so much to anyone who had any input!!"

Headache,"Suffering since last 6 months now, need help","I am 28 years old and have been mostly healthy all my life except for the past 1 year, please hear me out:-The Problem: It is very hard to explain but I will try my best to explain my situation. I have been suffering from strange pressure like an exploding balloon inside my head since January. The pressure feels more on the center of the eye (top of the nose) accompanied by headaches, dizziness, confusion/ brain fog, blurry vision, random mild pain all over the head(back of the head, neck, jaw, ears etc). Triggers: Walking!!! with head titled slightly downwards or heavy exercise, poor diet are the main trigger points. Heat, cold, hunger, bad sleep are amplifiers. This all started when I had quit doing exercise as it seemed to elevate the pain and dizziness. Now I can’t exercise at all due to the fear of falling unconscious due to pain. Walking (which seems to be the most triggering activity) and tilting head downwards while walking seems to elevate the pain to unbearable levels and even hunger/dieting seems to trigger this as well. History: At first I thought, this is most likely a sinus infection and started taking antibiotics, antihistamines, steam inhalation, steroids etc. and visited multiple ENTs. My CT scan showed signs of sinusitis but I hardly doubt it since I never had this before in my life and nothing seems to work. I never even had a flu or cold in this period. The only thing that works and gives relief is if I sit down and eat all day but as soon as I try to be healthy the pain comes back.Help!!!: My quality of life has dropped significantly, I quit my job to get a treatment since I am an expat, cant exercise or diet and overweight, cannot concentrate on anything since most of my attention goes into this. I don’t know what to do next or what treatment/ doctors to go for. On broad research I found Neck posture, tension headache, exertional headache, anxiety/ stress as possible causes or even a nerve I pulled somewhere before. Anyone has any clue?"

Headache,Bad Brain fog 15 min after eating but sugar test is negative,"The problem started when I was about 18. anything I eat makes the following symptoms happens 15 min after:-Brain Fog-Sleepiness and Tirdness-Very thirsty-Rapid heart rate and palpitation-very irritable, nervous, depressed- if i don't take Ibuprofen (400-800mg) the brain fog leads to a terrible migraine.The symptoms at first were light and unnoticeable but started to get worse over the years. Now I'm 25 and the symptos are the worst ever. I go out of service every day for two hours at least just 5 min after I finish eating.I have made many blood sugar tests and all were negative.I visited more than 10 doctors in two countries so far and no one takes me seriously and some of them even laughed at me and said I'm deluded.Now I'm not just worried about my illness but also the daily ibuprofen intake. I know it's dangerous but I have no idea what to do or who I go to. I appreciate your suggestions."
Headache,Constant pressurized feeling in my head.,"I have had a non stop feeling of pressure, in my head, for over a month, and getting on for 2. It is on the top of my head, and is definitely more to my left hand side. My doctor arranged a blood test for me, but due to a fear of needles, and blood, I didnt go to the appointment. I do suffer with Depression, and im someone who worries about everything. My daughter died of a Brain Tumour, so having this now, has me really worried. Sometimes, this pain feels prickly, but it seems to be more painful as time goes on. Does anyone have any ideas what it could be, or sounds like? Thanks."

Headache,"Severe headache for a week, what should I do?","Hello guys, I am new here and I desperately search for an answer for my sudden headaches. I just turned 20 years old and I am a girl and an active student in University. My headaches started last Wednesday. I went to a soccer match and it was a very big match. It was loud and crowdy. The only thing I remember that was annoying was the sun which was shinning straight in my eyes. After the match, I got a bad headache and I thought it might be due to the sun and loud noises. I went to bed earlier. In the morning, my headache was still present. Why do I worry so much about a headache? I am a person who really rarely has headaches. I only get them during period (it is a regular period, no chances of being pregnant since I am a virgin) or when I cry. I did a big mistake and I went on google and I noticed the illness called meningitis. Which scared the living creeps out of me so on Friday, I decided to go to the doctor. My pain was mostly localized on my forehead, under my eyes and the sides of nose. And the right side on the back of my head hurt me as if someone had hit me. She told me if I had meningitis, I wouldn't be able to touch my chest with my chin and my neck would be extremely painful and stiff. And I did not have that. My temperature was 36.7°C (98.6°F) and we checked my blood pressure twice. It was 110/72 and 100/70. My heartbeats per minute were 70. She knocked under my eyes and forehead and it did hurt so she gave me antibiotics Hiconcil 500 mg and Ibuprofen Belupo 400 mg. She said I have a sinus headache. The soon I started taking them, it was better. But yesterday, the moment I slept less and the weather was gloomier, I got a headache again. I browsed through google so much I am convinced I have a brain bleed, tumor or mengingitis. I am not familiar with headaches. I have a checkup today and currently no headache but I am slightly nauseous. I have been eating well. Here are also some informations that maybe could help:- My dad had a hypothalamus tumor years ago. He is tumor free for years now but he suffers from acromegaly due to the hormone problems.- Headaches are common in my house. My little sister, dad and mum have them often. I don't.- I breathe through my mouth. My left sinus is completely clogged for 15 years meaning no air comes on or out if I blow or inhale.- I have problems with pollen and allergies.- My school is pretty stressfull but currently I am on a week break.- I have anxiety attacks whenever I feel bad (diagnosed emetophobia - fear of vomiting).- I sleep by an opened window whenever it is above 5°C outside since we have dry air.- My head is propped up by three pillows cause otherwise I have trouble breathing through my mouth.- I usually sleep maximum 6 hours a day and I take a nap in the afternoon. I usually go to bed at 1-2 AM, on school days at midnight.- I am not a fan of a dark so I sleep by turned on which automatically turns off after 120 minutes.- I am NOT irritated by loud noise or light.I hope they will be a help. I am desperate. I have a lot of problems with health and I don't really want to add a neurologist to the list. But I am so scared I might end up dying or getting a damage from a untreated headache. I want to be convinced it is nothing but I am terrified at the same time. Any of your advices will help.

Headache,What Type Of Headache Is This?,"My story began just over 6 months ago where I was watching TV in bed and I got the strangest feeling and my eyes went all funny and I couldn't focus on anything, I had to take off my glasses and just lie down and try to go to sleep. I thought nothing of it until I awoke the next day with the strangest 'foggy' feeling in my head like I was walking about in a daze, then came the pressure in my head that wouldn't shift.... Straight away I was terrified and thought something was seriously wrong but my fiancée put it down to tension headache (never had a headache in my 26 years on this planet).A few days later and it was no better so I went to GP who thought it was a sinus problem sinusitis. Got a week dose of antibiotics (amoxicillin) and a steroid nasal spray...did nothing! By this point I was in a state my head, the pressure would just be crippling to the point I was close to tears. I was googling things at work and kept seeing 'tumor' which made things unbearable. I went to out of hours at the hospital where I was told migraines and fobbed off with more cocodomol and told it wasn't my sinuses (I did have a constant blocked nose for 2 months but it had cleared and I felt no mucus since).2 days later my GP sent me for a CT scan at the hospital but on arriving I saw the neouro doctor who done some tests, blood ect and said I was fine and sent me on my way. Again I was in bits. The next night I checked my self into hospital where I spent overnight and got CT scan next day along with more bloods, ECG ect. Everything ok.Last week I finally got an MRI with contrast which today I was called to say it was normal and I'm due to see my headache specialist again on Thursday (this is all private so it's cost me a fortune, the NHS is terrible so had no choice).I've had eye examCT of brainENT hearing testBloodsECGMRI with contrastPassed the doctors neuro tests.The lightheadness is a killer and sometimes it's really hard being out and about as I feel out of it all the time, then the buzzing in my head drives me crazy at night....all this on top of a frontal pressure headache that never let's up ( scalp is also very sensitive).I was nervous to post on here earlier before I had an mri incase something was found but now I have it my doctor tells me I have NDPH. I'm not sure what that means and I don't understand how someone with no previous head or ear for that matter problems can suddenly be plagued like this with never ending symptoms?My ears feel full all the time and crunch but ENT had a loom and said they were fine, been on antibiotics and no difference. My head feels heavy and scalp is really sensitive. Jaw clicks sometimes but no pain.Is this tmj? Is this ever going to go away?"
Headache,Headache with Occipital bone pain??,"I was wondering if anyone could help me figure this out..Four days ago I woke up with pretty bad pain on my Occipital bone one the right side.It felt bruised and hurt to touch.Then the pain was constant and throbbing.Now,four days later my neck on that side is tight and sore and have had a constant headache. Before this I was having pain on the same side in my face right near my ear as well as ear pain.I am SUPER dizzy too.I do have menieres disease as well so I think this problem is aggravating the menieres and dizziness.I saw my ENT for the ear and face pain and she noticed I had fluid in my ear and treated it,but said it did not look like an infection.My nose has been super stuffy as well.Having menieres I tend to hold my head stiff in fear of dizziness and I sleep propped on 4 pillows due to dizziness.After researching all I keep seeing is OCCITAL NEURALGIA ?.I read it can be from neck issues or sometimes infection and the lymph nodes in the Occipital swell.I plan on calling the Dr tomorrow but does anyone have thoughts or similar symptoms? The pain is pretty bad.It feels just like I bumped my head.....Anyone?"

Headache,Dr. Ducic Headache Surgery,Hello everyone - I have been suffering from an intractable headache for just over a year (not nearly as long as many of you I know). I was diagnosed with occipital neuralgia and occipital nerve blocks help a lot (but I do not see a forum specifically for ON). I have recently been referred to Dr. Ducic in Washington DC for nerve decompression surgery. I have read a lot of positive reviews on this doctor and surgery. Has anyone here worked with Dr. Ducic? Had the surgery? Were you successful in getting insurance to cover it? Thanks everyone!
Headache,"Headache on right side of head for 5 years, also earache since the last year","Hi, I am a 25 year old man. I live a very healthy lifestyle. I have 2 medical/physical conditions: 1, I have irritable bowel syndrome. And 2, I have a headache on the right side of my head. This started 5 years ago as a dull feeling of pressure just above my right ear. It came and went. Sometimes I felt it for a couple days. Some days or weeks it was gone again. But it kept on coming back. And it started to worsen. After some time it changed into a headache. Sometimes above my ear, sometimes further to the back and sometimes further to the front. I went to a neurologist but he told me everything was fine. He thought it might be an enlarged or oversensitive blood vessel in my head that causes the pressure and discomfort. But after 4 year of worsening symptoms I also have earpain accompanying the headache on the right side. I went to an audiologist for custom made earplugs, and she noticed my right ear has 12 dB hearing loss, while my left ear is fine. Does anyone have any idea what might be going on and what I can do about it? I'm getting quite desperate. The headaches are everyday, and they also make me less able to focus and concentrate, and give me a constant fuzzy feeling of tiredness. It doesn't seem like a migraine or cluster headache.

I've been a perfectly healthy human being up until I turned 25 where I feel like things have just gone down hill quickly.From the moment I wake up, to the moment I go to sleep, I see white spots in my eyes. Almost grainy like vision. The floaters are particularly noticible if it's a cloudy day outside (looks like hundreds of little things swimming round in the sky). I also see these things when I shut my eyes on the inside of my eye lids. They very miniscule but there in there hundreds. When I went on a plane recently and looked out the window it looked like little colourful fireworks going off in the clouds.The lower back right (especially) and lower back left of my head have pain almost every day. It feels like the bottom left / right of my head is putting pressure on my skull. Moving my head around causes pain at the top of my neck / base of my skull.I have bad sleeping issues. I wake up probably at least twice a night. First thing in the morning I feel as though I've never been to sleepThis all makes me feel quite dizzy as wellI was diagnosed with Paroxsymal Atrial Fibrillation in March 2016. This has subsequently been treated with an ablation an I am off all medication, but the symptoms continue.I've been to see an opthamologist who says my eyes are healthy (my actual vision itself is fine)I've had 3 MRI Scans of my head. All of which are normal. I had a follow up ultrasound of my neck recently to check for carotid artery disease. That was also normal.The doctors think I'm making it all up and say it's stress related. It's not stress related! The only thing I'm stressed out about is why I am like this. I have been having back / neck massages & physio to try to release whatever it is that's there without success.This morning I saw another eye doctor who told me it was ""Something I would have to live with"" which I just cannot accept with no actual diagnosis. I mentioned about going to see a neurologist and he just told me it wouldn't be any benefit as the scans were clear.Being in work is absolutely horrible being surrounded by computer screens and lights which just seems to exasperate the issueAny suggestions please?"
Headache,Weed brain fog,"Ok so i'm 17 years old in high school,11th grade and Im not a smoker but one of my friends decided to smoke weed and such.

Headache,Cluster headaches or Not??,"I am 62 years old and on 14th Feb this year I had my first extra painful headache. Started with watering left eye (which turns into a noticeable drooping lid) and in the upper back gum/molar area and then spread to my eye and above into my forehead. There was no pre warning and in 62 years I had never experienced this previously. I am now into the 9th week with pain ranging from a just tolerable 5 on my own scale to a full on 10 which is virtually unbearable and on two occasions recently I had to score a ""12"" which is a palce that I would not want to put my worst enemy!!!Initially, these attacks were confined to two particular times of the day, around 7.30 pm and then again after an hour or so around 11.30 pm. More recently they can occur during the daytime, especially in the afternoons. Sometimes the timescale is very short of a few minutes in the daytime , but normally around one to two hours in the evenings and at night.My GP has suggested from the early stages that this is a syndrome ""cluster headaches"" and currently I am taking verapamil 80mg 3 x per day and have Zolmitriptan nasal spray which if I catch the attack at the right time can sometimes seem to help. I have tried to obtain as much information as I could by reading various medical descriptions and also some patient emails on forums.The one thing that I have yet to see on any information is the ""draining"" feeling I get either just before the onset, sometimes during and for example today after a particularly painful attack last night. After this attack and having taken the nasal spray even two hours later it felt as if my eye had been punched, I had a stabbing pain in my ear and my gum was numb. To me there is something that has a peculiar taste which seems to drain from somewhere above the gum at the rear of my mouth. I have had dental xrays so there is definitely no tooth abscess, however having had one before the sensation is similar.I have tried to make sense of this problem, but as I explained to my GP everything seems completly random. I have stopped drinking anything alcoholic for weeks, I eat a healthy diet, and try to avoid what is said to possibly start these ""clusters"" but whatever I do there is no let up.Can anyone shed some light on this, as firstly according to the data that I have read I am over the normal upper age limit and what is the ""draining"" that is evident.Thank you.Chris.

Headache,"Feeling Effects of the Choking Game, how Serious is it?","My brother and I stupidly decided to play a variant of the choking game to see who was stronger and it went wrong. The rules were that the legs would squeeze the other person's neck until that person gave up (signalled by tapping out), whoever tapped out first was the loser and therefore weaker.My brother was up first and I let go after about 220 seconds (we would count out loud) as I couldn't get him to tap out. When it was his turn to choke me, I didn't take it seriously as I'm 18 years old, 6'0 and 140 pounds and he is a mere 11 years old, 4'9 and 60 pounds. I assumed that I wouldn't tap out either. So I was surprised by the pain and by the time my brother had counted to 3, I had already tapped out. I claimed that I wasn't ready and we did it again. This time I didn't submit and passed out around the 15 second mark. My brother didn't notice I was knocked out and continued squeezing.He said that around the 200 second mark he noticed that I was shaking severely and so he let go. After that, I was out cold for about 10 minutes, my mouth was foaming and I had urinated and excreted.After that, I felt very dizzy and had a headache but I didn't feel that it warranted a doctor but now I've noticed some possible symptoms. I've thrown up twice since the choke (yesterday) and it took me about 10 minutes to stand up after waking up today.What was the shaking? Did I have some kind of seizure? I've read a lot about the dangerous side effects and I've had really intense headaches since the incident yesterday. Will this go away? My friend told me that sometimes people shake after getting knocked out and it's normal, so I didn't go to the doctor. Should I go? What are the effects of the game that I could have?"
Headache,"Constant headache behind ears worried out of my mind, please help!!!!","Evening,I've had on & off headache behind my ears and down my neck for about 6 weeks, I've taken inbruprofen, muscle rub and ice/heat packs but nothing seems to make any difference. Sometimes I wake up with it and sometimes it creeps up during the day.It makes me feel quite nauseous and lightheaded and I'm really worried that it's a brain tumour or something else. Has anyone else had similar symptoms ???"
Headache, Headache for 2 years. Tried EVERYTHING,"This is going to be a very long forum. I apologize in advanced. My headaches started around 2 years ago. I started to have one a day, then two, then three. I would use over the counter medications to deal with them daily, or have someone rub my head constantly. After a while the medications stopped working, and my headaches got worse and worse. They are now 24/7 constant headaches. The pain never stops. I have lived with an on going headache for at least a year in a half. And nothing helps the pain. The only thing that changes with my headaches is the intensity of the pain. Although I am in pain 24/7, the pain can intensify to where it's throbbing and pounding in my head, making me naseous and not able to function. I had to quit one of my jobs in November and recently had to quit my other job just last week. Now as for what I have tried to fix them. 1st chiropractor: did adjustments on me. No relief. Said one of my legs were longer than the other. Gave me a shoe lift. Doctor: said I might be having rebound headaches from all the over the counter medication. So I went off of all meds for months. Nothing. Physical therapy: mainly did massages and adjustments. No relief. Neurologist: put me on amatryptalyn and venlafaxine. Nothing. 2nd chiropractor: did neck adjustments again. Nothing. I got a CT scan, which showed nothing. Rolfer: said I had tons of built up scar tissue causing main to go through my neck and into my head. He worked on me but no relief. Then we went to the dentist: he said it was from me clenching my teeth at night so he gave me a splint. No relief. Then we went to a spine specialist because I developed tight muscles in my neck and had constant neck pain. Let me add that my headache pressure is mainly at the base of my skull. And occasionally in my temples. The spine doctor said my vertebrae in my neck had been pulled straight when it's supposed to be curved. He said this was due to muscle spasms that pulled it straight. He said the problem now is to figure out what's causing the muscles to spasm. This is where I'm at now. As no one can figure it out. He put me on muscle relaxers which did nothing. Had me start sleeping on my back as I was a stomach sleeper my whole life. And had me buy a new tempurpedic pillow. The only route we haven't tried is allergies/food wise/ or anything in all honesty. I recently went to the hospital and got blood work done because my doctor wanted to see something about auto immune elevations or deficiencies dealing with anti inflammatory stuff. I also spoke with a doctor recently who said I had occipital neuroalgia. And that my scar tissue is pulling on my dural membrane compressing the bones in my skull to compress and be pulled. Basically. I Ive given up. I'm depressed and want it to just end. I'm so hopeless I've never even seen improvement. I'm only 18. And I want my life back.

Headache, Brain MRI - Help Understanding,"Hi Everyone,I got the results from my brain MRI today - I picked up the radiologists report cold and my doctor of course never called me nor returned my phone call. I was hoping someone can help me interpretating his findings because I'm freaking myself out.Directly abutting the superior colliculus is a 7x6x8 mm mildly FLAIR hyperintense mass. A punctate foci of susceptibility is noted anteriorly within the mass likely reflecting a small calcification. No acute intracranial hermorrhage, extracerebral fluid collection, or midline shift. No acute infarction. No abnormal susceptibility. The cerebral volume is appropriate for the patient'a stated age. The ventricles are normal in size and configuration. The visual paranasal sinuses are essentially clear. No suspicious marrow signal.His impression was:7x6x8 mm mass in region of the pineal gland which may represent a proteinaceous cyst. Thin section pre and postcontrast coronal and sagittal T-2 weighted imaging of this region is recommended for further evaluation provided there is no contraindication. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or transcortical infarction.Any help figuring this out will really help ease my anxiety."
Headache,Possible occipital neuralgia?,"Hi, I am new to the site so please bear with me. For nearly two years now, I have had a severe pressure pain at the base of my skull on the right hand side of my head. It has steadily got worse, often flaring up whilst I have been in the gym, but now, like tonight, it has ben throbbing/stabbing so badly that I am unable to sleep.I have been back and forth to my doctor about 5 times so far and every time she has sent me for a blood test and concluded that I have low iron and to take supplements for that. My whole family are susceptible to iron deficiencies and I am a regular blood donor who has never been turned away, so I am confident low iron has nothing to do with it. I was getting quite frightened that I could possible have an AVM in my head, or something putting pressure on my skull, so after much persuasion, my doctor referred me for a CT scan that came up 'normal'. She called me and suggested that I keep taking iron tablets as this must be the cause of my 'headaches'.I do NOT have a 'headache'!! I keep reitereating to my doctor that it is a constant pressure in that area, sometimes my head even hurts to touch, but she is insistent that it is a headache. Occasionally I get a pain behind my right eye and over the top of my head, so I am getting a lot better at wearing my glasses any time that I am reading or studying. I have looked online at my symptoms, and I think it could possibly be occipital neuralgia - does anyone have symptoms like this? I have looked on other threads but there seem to be a lot of associated physical symptoms, for me it is just the head pain.If you would believe it, my doctor actually asked me if I wear my hair up at night as she thought having my hair in a loose ponytail could be causing the pain. When I said I wanted a scan, she told me she would 'have to make something up' that sounded worse than what I told her because if she sends a person for a scan and it's not serious, she gets a slap on the wrist, as scans are expensive and she can only request three per month.I am going back this week to discuss occipital neuralgia with her (let's hope she knows what it is!) and to insist on maybe an alternative treatment to injections or meds - maybe accupuncture? Any advice would be appreciated, she just does not understand. This pain is getting worse and worse. Thank you - apologies for such a long thread.T x "

Headache,"Severe, searing side head pains","Prior to what you are about to read I had never suffered with head ache/pain in any way. As a child and until my teens I did suffer with embarrassing nosebleeds that would happen anytime/anywhere. This was eventually stopped via cauterisation.A couple of years back I began experiencing severe head pain; I don't mean a headache but the worst kind of searing pain one might imagine. It began one evening while I was watching television. I did not know what was happening to me and had to sit completely still to find any kind of relief.My wife and I were obviously alarmed and concerned, but at ten o’ clock at night, completely disorientated by the suddenness of the whole thing, we were stunned and at a loss as to what to do; but as the thing appeared to pass within a few minutes we did not call for help. However, it happened again a few days later.Again at night, but this time it lasted much longer and was completely unbearable and an ambulance was called. I was taken to hospital where a doctor examined me, but during the examination he tried to have me lie down – I could not. Whereas I could find a position to lessen the pain whist sitting or standing bolt upright any movement of my head to the side (any side) caused the intense pain to return. The doctor ignored my protestations and tried to force me to lie down, which I could not do. The upshot was: he said he could find nothing wrong with me and discharged me.Since that time I have experienced these head pains on numerous times, generally at night when I try to lie down in bed. I have often spent the night in the spare room sitting-upright in a chair. The sensation is one of pressure inside my head (although my GP advises me it is not pressure). I have noticed if I squeeze my nose and blow (the way one does to equalise pressure in an aircraft) I obtain some relief, I also find that a watery discharge is released from my nose.Finally, in order to appreciate the intense and unbearable pain I experience - if one has ever dived below 200 feet you will know what I mean. I am not a diver, my friend is and this is how my friend explained how the pain sounded to him.Does anybody have any idea what might be the matter with me and can anybody help me please, I am 70 years of age and otherwise fit?"
Headache,Can a cluster headache be caused by exercise,"Hi , I am a 46 year old male and believe that I have started to have cluster headaches . All the symptoms are as listed here and the past few weeks have been the worst of my life trying to work and manage the intensity of pain . I am waiting on some results from the doctor to rule out other concerns but he asked me what has changed recently , The only thing I have been doing differently is alot of exercise and trying to lose weight by taking daily or exercise every other day on my cross trainer . If I am honest , I have probably been over doing it as its my first real exercise for a number of years !! The X trainer is located in my garage which gets very warm and I have been wearing quite a few layers in order to sweat as much and help with the calories and fat burn . I read that excessive heat or temperature rises can contribute so would appreciate any comments or thoughts on this . Many thanks and regards"
Headache,"Waiting for spring, high blood pressure when I didn't get my meds for a week. Symptoms started then.","It was a snafu by my pharmacy.I began feeling terrible. At 81 I am told I look mighty fine and a great deal younger, but I feel empy and hollow and spaced out. Mentaly I am very sharp, think clearer than most, quicker witted, and though I have nerve damage from a badly messed up spine I move well in spite of all sorts of pain issues related to the spine issues. Neck also injured years ago. Fingers go numb.It could be anxiety from many causes. Seasonal affective disorder, blood pressure and many issues too numerous to relate. Glaucoma and high eye pressure could also factor in, though I am on Lumigen (horribly expensive).I ate my breakfast, drank some coffee and ginger tea and slowly, as I write this, the horror of emptiness and dreadful hollow sensation is receeding. So possibly, it is anxiety and my blood pressure which is high even on meds.While I usually do not get headaches, it also seemed to touch me in my brain, though I am fully cognisent and no short or long term memory issues.I am a writer, so this actually interests me since I can use it for my character heroine.But it is most unpleasant while it last.High blood pressure spiking? neck and spine issues? Axiety over all sorts of problems common to the aging?I have an interesting life even now. "
Headache,HELP..my head feels piercing pain from bending over sneeze cough HELP,I need to know if anyone else has this. My husband has had these sympotms for a few months now. He has seen 2 Doctors and had CT w and w/o / MRI of brain W and W/O blood work and MRI of neck and spine and also MRA and MRV. He is not over weight and extremely active his whole life. When he sneezes it feels like a sharp piercing pain in his frontal forehead from temple to temple. He gets this with any straining and also when he tries to move around in bed such as turning from side to side. He cannot pick things up off the ground nor tie his shoes. The same pain if he tries to get in the car too. He rates this sharp apin a 9-10 everytime. Nothing takes this pain away. He can no longer do sit ups or push ups the closer the head is to the ground the instesity of the pressure pain is there. Once this has happens its a lingeirng headache for hours until he takes ibupropen. This has become dibiltating to his life. These simple tasks create pain for him daily. He doesnt smoke nor does he take any socail drugsor ever has he eats healthy and takes care of himself. He did take doxycycline in September for chest cold before the symptoms began in October. They have progressed since then. The ER doctor suggested teeth grinding..so were going to a doctor..but I thought it to be comical honestly. All the testing he has had done if read correctly by the radiologist are all in the clear no tumor no blockage no stroke. So now its possibly idiopathic intrcranial pressure he has maybe and there giving him acetazolamide..to see if it works to relive symptoms..but he has not pressure behind the eyes and no vision problems.He doesnt even have headaches unless he does those few movemets. He doesnt seem to meet the criterai of the IIH diagnosisI saw on the side effects of the doxycycline it can associated with the increased cranial pressure..I just hope someone else who has the same awful symptoms and is suffering will read this and provide some insight its so scary because after all this all these tests we no nothing........more doctors on the horizon more tests too..this is no way for somone to live without help in our modern life of science...the doctors to I feel are flooded with patience and its hard to find a doctor who will really listen and understand.
Headache,Headache since 3 weeks,"Hello ! I'm new here , I've been wanting to know about my headaches for a while now .Last month I had a pilonidal sinus excision done. I was given spinal anesthesia and after my recovery I had some slight side effects like a headache but I soon consulted my surgeon and he prescribed some medicines.It was cured and I was fine but after 2 weeks I began feeling weird .I started having mild sharp pain on the left side of my head and a slightly stiff neck.After a week it got worse .The pain spread all over my head and the pain wasn't unbearable it was just annoying . I did a huge mistake searching my symptoms on the net and thought I had brain cancer or something .My parents tried to make me understand but still deep down I think something's wrong with my head . I consulted my GP and he said it was usual stress related headache and then later I was not satisfied so I went back to my surgeon and asked him if I'm having side effects of the spinal anesthesia.He said that my headaches are stress related and I should start drinking coffee and also said to consult an Eye doctor . I still haven't had an MRI I'm just too scared to kno what's in my head . Sometimes I feel dizzy but not extremely . My head and neck just feels weird and heavy .sometimes my ear hurts .So I want to know if this is something I should be concerned about or is it my anxiety growing day by day ?Please help ..!"

Headache,Neck & head muscle spasms After surgery to remove osteoma tumor in sinus cavity,"I had surgery to remove an Osteoma tumor in my sinus cavity. It was very large and took 6 hrs to remove, chiseled through my nose, while my head was in a confined backward position. About 5-7 days after the surgery I noticed a new pain that went from my neck up the back of my head over to my forehead. Not like a headache, but like knives stabbing in my head. Also, motion from car affects it, and when I've tried to drive, my head feels like I can't hold it up and the pain becomes terrible. I went back to my surgeon who thought it might be occipital neuropathy, caused by surgery. She sent me to a neurosurgeon. He gave me a nerve block in the occipital nerve, did not help. He sent me to spine dr. Who did MRI on my spinal cord...nothing showed up so neurosurgeon did an intensive MRI on my brain to look at all aspects and found nothing. He sent me to a neurologist that specializes in headaches. He looked at all my records and thought I was having muscle spasms brought on by the surgery and gave me muscle relaxers. They have not helped. He said to try acupuncture and Yoga. This has been debilitating and has altered my life.

The back of my head has pain too and I think I may have tmj as my jaw clicks and my face hurts. I have seen an ENT specialist and all is ok. My ears crackle and plug to. I had an X-ray done of my head neck and sinuses and everything is good. I did blood work and all is ok. I have tried 2xs to do an MRI and could t do it die to clastrophobic even meds couldn't keep me calm . I'm trying the MRI again in June and I have an CT scan in March. Thursday I have an appt with a neurologist not because dr. Suggested but because I requested it. I'm convinced I have a brain tumor or brain cancer or an anerysum about to happen. Anyone have the same symptoms??? What test have you done? Also, who determines if you need a spinal tap?? Sorry for the long post. My dr. Not worried but I am. "
Headache,Which type of headache do I have? don't seem to fit one or the other and doctors don't know,"Fun never stops, more health problems. Thanks for reading i'll keep this breif Not looking for a cure, just trying to figure out which type of headache I have to push for a Nero or a ENT / get the right treatment. Had symptoms with no relief now for 8 weeks as follows: 24/7: Pressure in the front of my head both sides above eye brow, worse when i bend down and touching it hurts, not like a headache with a sharp pain Pressure behind eyes (like they are coming out of my head!) Sore Neck (cracks now, more recent symptom) Sound Sensitivity <-- worst one. My headache is NOT worse or better with sound, it's that things are actually much LOUDER and my ears crackle. Light Sensitivity - Looking at a bulb blinds me for a second but doesn't change the headacheLathargic / No concentration (probably because my headache is sucking the life out of me) Sometimes: Dizzy SweatingNo Energy No Appetite Been in regular contact with the GP and going again soon.Meds tried: Naproxen with Ibuprofen, Topamax, Paracetamol, Co codamol, Clonazepam... no relief what so ever. 10 day Antibiotic Amoxicillin many weeks ago which I am gonna ask to try again. Last 6 days Beta Blockers, mild help on the pain but no help with the pressure which is getting worse. Glad of any replies! "

Headache,Chronic Headache and Epilepsy ,"I have been treated for tension headaches and migraines since 2009. I have tried antimigraines, analgesics, muscle relaxants, nonsteroidal-anti-inflammatory and steroids, ssnri antidepressants and obviously acetaminophen and aspirin. I have had Botox, never block injections and sphenocath. My MRI CT scan and blood work are all clean. I often have to go to the ER for pain. They give me Benadryl cocktail among other IV meds. They end with Diludid which helps but when is wears off the headache immediately comes back. Nothing has ever fully relieved my headache. I just got out of the hospital after 3 weeks. My neurologist is out of ideas. He referred me to Mayo and even they said there was nothing they could do. My neurologist is doing another round of Botox and referring me to a headache center.

Headache,Long-lasting pressure in front of head?? (please help),"I’ll start from the beginning. I’m a 14 year old girl, 5’7ft/171 cm, 135 pounds. Around September of 2016, I started becoming extremely fatigued and had occasional headaches (though not often and not bad enough so I never really thought much about it). The fatigue was the worst part. It would cause me to become extremely tired throughout the day and I would be ready to fall asleep at 7pm every night. Waves of fatigue would come and go. I went to the doctor about this on two occasions for blood tests: no mono (I had it two years ago), nothing out of the ordinary.In early November 2016, I developed a pressure headache in the front of my head one night. It didn't feel like a migraine, just a terrible pressure mostly centered in my forehead. The feeling was a tightness or like something was pushing on my head. It was frustrating and aggravating. The pressure did not go away for two weeks. It was almost constant, sometimes the pressure would lessen, but never fully go away. It would get to the point where I would cry every night because it felt like my head was going to burst open. Later in the month I went to a neurologist who recommended getting my ferritin levels tested. Turns out I was at a 7, and I was prescribed with Ferrous Sulfate and a vitamin C supplement.Over the next 6 weeks, the fatigue disappeared almost completely. The headaches seemed to be improving, not constant and not as bad. In late December, the pressure in my forehead began to return. Over the course of a couple weeks, it became more constant and with higher intensity. I can feel the pressure even as I write this. After a couple weeks (now early January), the pressure became just like it was in November. Maybe not 24/7 constant, but the majority of the time. I first notice the pressure anywhere from 10 minutes to 1 hour after I wake up. The pressure is often around for so long that it makes me frustrated and moody. (My parents think that my headaches have to do with the hormones. In fact, the reason I am so upset is BECAUSE the headaches have been plaguing me. If the pressure disappeared, I would not be so upset.)I’m now starting to think that the fatigue and headaches were not related, and that the Ferrous Sulfate only fixed my fatigue. I went back to the neurologist on January 18th and she was very unhelpful, only speaking with me for less than 10 minutes and asking me what we should do next. She believes that my problem can be fixed with different kinds of medicine and isn’t looking anywhere else. As of two weeks ago, my ferritin is at a 22 and I’m continuing to take it.I tried Topamax for a couple days back in November, but I stopped because the side effects made me feel 5x worse. Two weeks ago, I tried Amitriptyline but stopped that because of the strange side effects. As of four days ago, I have been taking Propranolol, but nothing has changed.The neurologist seems to believe (and even though I have strongly told her otherwise) that I have anxiety and this is what is causing my headaches. I “have my head screwed on tight” as my dad says, and I truly don’t have any depression or anxiety. I am not abnormally stressed, and I do well in school. I go back to the neurologist on March 1st but I really don’t think I want to continue seeing her.I am looking for answers. I don’t know what else to do, my parents are underestimating me and chalking it up to hormones. These pressure headaches have been plaguing me ever since early November, and it is starting to affect my social life and attitude. I can’t live like this anymore and I really, truly just need help. Any advice is appreciated."

Headache,Intense pressure in my head,"I have been suffering from waves of intense pressure in my head. I am 24 years old. It started about two months ago. Before it started I was getting really bad headaches which was unusual for me. I also had ringing in my ears. I then started to get pains all over my body. The pain was random. For a couple minutes it would be throbbing pain in part of my leg and then it would stop and be on my arm. I decided to go to the doctor After I started getting the pressure in my head which would cause panic attacks. She took some blood tests and everything came back normal. I went back because it kept continuing. I kept getting waves of pressure. When it was happening it felt like I had super senses. Especially with smell. Sometimes it was a wave of powerful smell and sometimes it was continuous powerful smell. I was driving home one night and out of nowhere in less than a seconds time i couldn't feel my head neck or arms. I freaked out and called my dad to take me to the hospital. They did an ekg, blood tests and a ct scan. I have also had several more blood tests, an mri, an emg, an eeg, and everything came back normal (all scans were on head). I am no longer having panic attacks just the pressure in my head. It is becoming more and more frequent. I laid down the other night and the pressure was on the top of my head, so I put more pillows behind my head to prop my head up. The pressure moved slowly down my head putting pressure on my ears and backs of my eyes and temples. Also my blood pressure seems to be getting lower. Usually 110 over 70 or higher but keeps getting lower last check in was 98 over 68."

Headache,Terrified I have a Brain tumour ,"Hi, I'm 19 and for the past 4 months I've had these symptoms: Symptoms:* Nearly constant Headache * Ear ringing * fatigue * Tingling/numbness in hands and feet* Elastic band feeling and numbness in left calf muscle * ""The sighs""* Chills/sweating* Armpit pain - more in left* Occasional Chest pain - left side of breast and chest, sternum and below left breast - could still be costonchondritis though * Palpitations * Random nausea * Pain in right side of stomach - lower and higher * Lump in throat * Sore throat * Loss of appetite on occasion * Dizziness * Concentration lacking * Anxiety - mostly because of symptoms * Depression - mostly because of symptoms I went to the doctors probably in excess of 10 times. I had a blood test a couple months ago which discovered I have a b12 deficiency and borderline low thyroid. I was also slightly aenemic. I switched back to my old doctors recently and have had another blood test today to check for thyroid, vitamin D and something else I can't remember. I'm also having an MRI tomorrow morning. And I'm so scared I have a tumour. I've never been this scared in my entire life. And I stupidly watched some YouTube videos earlier of people who have had a brain tumour and they had similar symptoms to me and were even around the same age and it's freaked me out even more. I feel like I'm just getting iller and although I know my anxiety is in no way helping this, I can't help but still be terrified it is the worst case scenario "
Headache,Memory difficulties! Age 26,"Hi, I'm 26 years of age and I've always thought I've had a poor memory growing up I've (even to this day) never been able to learn a full song.

It's even effecting work, when I start a new job it's hard because I can't remember the information they're telling me. I'm not thick it's just down to my memory! I feel it's getting worse, I say this because I'm a week into a new job and even the questions I'm asking I've asked them a few times! Is this normal? My brain struggles to store information and it gets me down, massively! Please any feedback would be much appreciated. P"
Headache,Need advice about headaches.,"So here's a brief history on what I've been through recently. I was complaining of headaches and dizziness so I went to an ENT who performed an MRI of my brain which came back 100% normal. This was in October. I've seen a neuroligist who said everything was normal and that my headaches could be tension.The pain I'm experiencing is at the back of the head, the sides or behind my ear. Not all the time and not in all those spots at once. The pain comes and goes for a few seconds than goes away.A) Does anyone else have these headaches?B) Are they tension headaches, or could this be related to an unknow issue with my eyes?C) What is the easiest way to get rid of these headaches?D) Should I worry?Thanks!"

Headache,"Chronic headaches, dizziness and Tinnitus?","Hi all,Anyone having the same issues with me currently? I am having chronic daily headaches which are normally at my temples and dizziness as well. Recently I got tinnitus (which sounds like after you heard something loud) and I'm not sure it's because of the Amitriptyline I'm on (5mg/day).I'm very worried about the possibility of hydrocephalus/IIH (Intracranial hypertension).For your info, I have seen my Neuro 2 weeks ago and did an MRI too but he said I do not have any of these. I also saw a Ophthalmologist yesterday who said my optic nerves looked ok (and he cleared me of glaucoma as well). I saw an ENT today and he did hearing tests and it was fine but said the dizziness I'm hearing might be cause of a crystal in the ear (not exactly BPPV).I'm so scared if I have hydrocephalus/IIH and it's causing me to feel depressed and worried."

Headache,Head pains,"Just over 2 weeks ago I got these really big painful shooting pains going through the right side of my head through my eye, it was so bad I was hitting my head to try and stop it, I didn't know what to do. It lasted only about 10 seconds. Since then my head hasn't felt right, I've had a few headaches that go with pain killers. But I seem to have this constant dull ache still there. The odd mild shooting pain. I also get an aching around the eye socket and slightly down the side of my nose. I've been getting lightheaded at times, sometimes even when sitting still. I am 49 year old female. I am on blood pressure meds. I was ok before the shooting pain. I keep worrying I have something wrong going on in my brain. I have no other symptoms.sometimes I also feel my heart racing, but I think I might be in a panic sometimes. I am taking vitamin d for deficiancy and also iron because I was anemic. I can't help thinking I'm also in perimenopause, so wonder if that's anything to do with it. I will be seeing my dr tomorrow but I have little faith in him. He will probably say it's a virus. He always does when he doesn't know. I do suffer with migraines that I get every month or two. And it's in the same area of the shooting pain that I got. But this feels very different. Thank you for any answers. "
Headache,Why would slight pressure on my neck cause a headache?,"Hi all,I hope you can help me identify the cause of my headaches, which are increasing in severity.If external pressure is applied to either side of my neck or carotid arteries, such as from a shirt collar, I immediately develop discomfort and pain, which leads to a frontal headache. I first noticed the symptoms 16 months ago, when I found I could no longer wear a necktie for the entire workday without developing a headache.After several months, I could no longer wear a tie at all. Now, I cannot button the top two buttons of dress shirts, and even some loose T-shirts cause pain. At my current rate of decline, I may soon have constant pain in the absence of external pressure.My doctors are at a loss. I am an otherwise healthy man in my mid-forties. I have had a battery of tests, including CT scans, MRIs, and MRAs of my head and neck. They have been normal except for the presence of mild fibromyalgia dysplasia (FMD) in my internal carotid arteries. (The FMD is located inside my cranium, above my neck, and is not causing stenosis. My doctors do not think it is causing my symptoms.)I would greatly appreciate any help or ideas.Many thanks,Andrew"

Headache,Constant Headache for 2 months ,"I've had a constant headache in between my eyes for about 2 months. Before all of this I had an MRI on my neck area because I had been having neck issues at school. Nothing unusual turned up on the MRI about my neck.. But it did show I had a sinus infection. I got some antibiotics to treat it. Ever since then I've had constant pressure in between my eyes on my forehead above my nose. Do you guys think it's still a sinus issue or something else? Other than the headaches I feel pretty healthy. I don't have any congestion, coughing, or a fever. The last 3 days or so have been pretty bad. Another detail... I try ibuprofen and some over the counter nose sprays and nothing has helped it. Do you guys think it could be an eye issue as well? I wear contacts and have noticed the last couple weeks my left eye seems to be pretty blurry so I think I need a new prescription."

Headache,Please help! Constant headaches for 10 weeks that vary in pain! ,"Hello I'm a 29 year old male, who up until 10 weeks ago was healthy , active at the gym , however does smoke 15 a day (which even so shouldn't be doing this)One day I started to get a slight sense of dizziness followed by a headache. I have had headaches in the past , but normally a pint of water and couple of paracetamol is enough to ease it. The pain then got much worse for the next 2 weeks, violent headaches on both sides of head , sometimes waking me up. I tried codene , ibuprofen , paracetamol , everything. Eventually went to the doctors. I have had a CT scan and an MRI scan , both come back clear. I have had my eyes tested , perfect vision. I have been tested for gluten allergy and all clear. I have also had iron levels checked , no cause for concern. After the violent headaches passed after 2-3 weeks , I have had a daily headache since , when I wake up in the morning it's there without fail at the back of my head , normally either side of my crown. Also these headaches sometimes shift to behind my eye. However the daily headaches are mainly back of my head! I have migraines a lot more frequently where I can't stand light of loud noise. I have also had acupuncture and tension relief massages on my neck and back. I'm losing my mind!! I don't feel myself atall , very depressed about it all and thinking very negative thoughts daily ! Doctors fob you off with pills. I am now on naproxen which sometimes does ease it off , but not for long ! It would be very re assuring if someone else has developed this completely out of no where and also baring in mind all major stuff has apparently been ruled out , what my next step should be. The NHS In England is very stretched and it seems it's easier for them to just say ""take more pills"" which in fact isn't getting to the bottom of the problem. Thank you in advance for any replies Hello I'm a 29 year old male, who up until 10 weeks ago was healthy , active at the gym , however does smoke 15 a day (which even so shouldn't be doing this)One day I started to get a slight sense of dizziness followed by a headache. I have had headaches in the past , but normally a pint of water and couple of paracetamol is enough to ease it. The pain then got much worse for the next 2 weeks, violent headaches on both sides of head , sometimes waking me up. I tried codene , ibuprofen , paracetamol , everything. Eventually went to the doctors. I have had a CT scan and an MRI scan , both come back clear. I have had my eyes tested , perfect vision. I have been tested for gluten allergy and all clear. I have also had iron levels checked , no cause for concern.

Headache,"feeling numb/weird in head, neck, arms, chest","Recently I have been feeling weird in my forehead, neck, arms and chest area. I'll just explain past the last week. A little over a week ago (on a friday) I decided to smoke some weed with my friend after having quit for two months. Everything was fine after that, so I highly doubt this is the cause. Anyways the next two days i was studying and i manage to get only 3-4 hours of sleep each day. Then when i went to school on monday i noticed i had this tension headache where my head was squeezing. I went home and it went away. I continued to study for the next few days and finished my exams. I decided to chill with my friend, but while I was at his house i slipped on his staircase and hurt my hand while trying to stop my fall. My hand had some pain and tingling, but i thought it would go away, however when i went home it felt like my hand kinda wasn't there. It felt weird. Over the next few days leading up to today, my arms, chest, neck and forehead (sinus area too) has also felt this feeling. I don't know if it is just anxiety or a more serious problem. I also dont know how to describe it. Id say its like numbness but I can feel everything perfectly fine and I have full control over movement. I really don't know what to do and Im really worried.

Headache,Experiencing new type of headache,"Yesterday in the afternoon i started feeling some pain in my top right side of my head, unlike any headache I've ever had before. It varies in intensity, it can be very painful and it can be completely painless, though I can feel that it's still there. occacionally it can be completely gone and I even forget that i had it, then it creeps back up. When I woke up today I thought it was gone, then a couple of hours later it came back.

Headache,Severe pain in left side of head/jaw/eye/ear for 3 months,"Hello,In August I began developing pain solely on the left side of my face- mostly my jaw, ear, and eye. It was primarily diagnosed as sinusitis- however a CT scan that proved untrue. The pain is constant (I have researched into Trigeminal Neuralgia however my doctor insists it is not that as occaisionally the pain will shift to the other side) I was put on Amitriptyline, however this had no effect- and have been taking Propranolol for a month, and if anything my pain is worsening. Last week I had an MRI scan, to have just been informed it came back 'normal' and so I am unsure what to do now as I am a nineteen year old at university, i've quit my job, and am strongly considering dropping out as the pain means I stay in bed every day. Any suggestions of my condition would be so greatly appreciated, as I really am this close to giving up."
Headache,Three year headache and migraines just getting worst - please read,"Constant daily headaches that do sometimes turn into migraines. My headaches started around three years ago but would only occur about two to three times a week. As time went on they started to get more and more frequent until the 25th of August 2015 I had a major migraine that lasted 3 days even went to the doctor got pain injections and tablets that made me sleep most of the time – since than the pain in my head has not left me. The weird thing is this pain I can pin point where the pain and pressure is and even if I get a “normal” headache and I take my tablet I can feel the relieve of that from the normal headache but this pain that is causing the migraines to come and go is just not going away anymore does not matter what medication I take not even the injections work anymore – my memory is going I keep on walking into things and feel that my body is getting weaker. I use to be a clever person, now I struggle with the stupidest things. I only take my anti depressed as being in pain is causing me to feel depress. I don’t even want to take the pain medicine unless I need to be able to take care of something as it only brings partial relieve. I come to work every day and try my best as I need this job but honestly don’t know how long I can still hold on. I wear a gum guard at night and have to take sleeping tablets as the pain won’t let me sleep. The one new thing I have discovered is that that is a point at the top off the back of my head that is very sensitive and if I lie on it or press on it my migraine increase 10 folds, I don’t know anymore – I am a wife and a mother of two young boys that need me – I need my live back – please help "
Headache,Headache for 3 weeks and stiff/painful neck? ,"I've had this headache for just over 3 weeks now. It started out as a migraine and I was getting pain down my face. Went to the docs after 8 days & she said it was an ear infection. Went on a course of erythromycin for 7 days. They never worked. Went back. My temp was still high, ear inflamed and pain still in head (mainly at the back). Its now been just over 3 weeks and the pain is still there. When I lie down I have to make sure my head is straight, and even then my neck and head hurt. My neck feels quite stiff and my head feels so heavy. My headache gets worse when I move my neck or move in general. Like loads of pressure! I had blood tests done last time I went to the doctors to test for infection and they've all come back normal. I had a throat swab too but that result hadn't come back when I rang to find out the results. What could this be?"

Headache,"I need help with possible ""Rebound Headache"" symtoms","I was advised by a ER doctor to take Aleve for a jaw injury that left me in serious pain. After taking 2 pills a day for a little over a month ( again was recommended to me by the doctor ) I started developing bad headaches, I started getting very agitated and nervous for no reason as well. After being unable to get though to the doctor, I just had enough and stopped taking the pills. Its been abit over 2 weeks now and I still have the headaches, sometimes the headaches are more severe then others.After going online and researching the symtoms I have I found I may have something callled ""Rebound Headaches"" which is aquired through the over use of certian over the counter medication. My question is this...... How long do these rebound headaches last and should I take care of this on my own or should I go and seek help from a doctor."
Headache,Chronic daily headaches help me please. ,"My story: help!! I am a candidate for constant daily headaches that do sometimes turn into migrains. My headaches started around 2 years ago but would only occur about once a day. As time went on they started to get more and more frequent until I was having 2 - 3 more a day. At this time if I took OTC medication or someone massaged my head, my headache would be relieved. I could always pin point where the pain and pressure was coming from as well. Either the top right or left side of my temples or the back of my head in the left or right side. Always one of these 4 places. Also, these headaches would progressively get worse if I didn't take medication, and eventually turn into a migraine. Because medication always got rid of my headaches, I never did anything about them. As long as I had a way to take away the pain, I was okay. This being said, I was taking SO much OTC medication every single day, around 3-4 times a day. As more time passed the headaches become even more frequent to the point where I would wake up and go to bed with them. All OTC medication stopped working for me. Nothing helped these headaches anymore. I have braces due to a misaligned jaw problem, so we asked him if my headaches could be due to this. He didn't seem to think so. Went to my dentist and he said that anyone with such a horrible bite and as much orthotic stuff I have going on would cause headaches. He came me a steroid for inflammation that he was SURE would make my Tmj joint stop being inflamed and stop my headaches. Took it. No luck. I then tried 2 chiropractors who said I had one leg a cm longer than the other and THIS could be the cause because all my muscles are being pulled more on one side than the other. I was then directed to physical therapy to address this. But no relief after going 6 times so we stopped. I went multiple times to my local doctor who suggested they may be rebound headaches from so much medication usage over the past years. She prescribed me amitriptalyn which made my migraine at the time go away but my constant headache was still there. I then went to a neurologist who said that I had either rebound headaches, or it's just a genetic disfortune that I have where I will always have migrains, but that there's medication I can take to treat them. SO, he put me on a different medication, venlaflaxine, and said that if it worked, that would mean I was just blessed with the misfortune of having migrains and I would have to take it the rest of my life. I've been on it for a month now and it hasn't helped my headaches. So we think this isn't the case. I am almost completely hopeless because I feel like I have tried everything. Wasted so much money. And have found no relief. I have a CT scan set up to see if they find anything. But I'm not sure what else to resort to if it doesn't show anything. The only thing I haven't tried is diet, food allergies, etc. so is it rebound headaches? My longer leg? My misaligned jaw? Genetics? I hope and pray for the day we find an answer and I can be out of pain. Any advice or knowledge would be so much appreciated. I would love to become happy and enjoy my life againMy story: help!!

Headache,Headache on left side of head ,"Hi I have been having an on again off again pain in the back left side of my head almost behind my ear since April of this year.

Headache,"Dull Pain and Pressure Only in Right Side of Head, Any Explanations?","Hey there, for about 2 months now I've been dealing with this random pressure inside of the right side of my head, it came from out of nowhere.I have generalised anxiety and OCD thoughts, and have had this for about 4 years now, and that causes me to severely overthink things daily. I have been treated and have medication for my anxiety which seems to relax me well before bed and I recognise that before I fall asleep the pressure and headache in my head is almost gone on most nights.My anxiety fear is that I have a brain tumor, an aneurysm, a hemmorage or whatever severe thing I can think of (even as I'm writing those things I felt an instant pain in my head).I've been to the doctors, but he was quite rude and refused to let me get an MRI because there was apparently no physical evidence to prove I have pain in my head and it's all delusions. The symptoms I have been experiencing have been:Pressure in my head that has progressively gotten worse the more I have worried about it over the past 2 months.Dull pain in top right side of head that even hurts when I touch my head.Feeling fearful and worrying whenever I think about it which leads to it getting worse over the day.Constantly checking the internet to see what my symptoms relate to and praying it's not to anything severe.One thing I will note is that I had a concussion back in January this year that I never treated or anything, and the spot where it's hurting now is the place I hit my head on, so my fear is that it is related to that, however the doctor said that the symptoms would have occured sooner if it was related to that injury.I greatly appreciate any information anyone can give me on this subject and how I can stop worrying about it "
Headache,Nearly continuous headaches for several weeks??,"I'm 16 and I've been having headaches for a number of weeks now. It's a dull feeling pain usually and it's around the centre at the top of my head and it's always there. Sometimes I can't feel it at all but this lasts at maximum for about 1/2 a day. But usually it's just continuous and can feel worse when I'm moving around such as when I took the dog for a walk it got to a point where I had to sit down because of the pain. And there's been a few times where I've seen stars around the outside of my vision. It also throbs like I can feel my blood pumping around my head...Paracetamols definitely don't work I think they make it worse. Also I'm eating and drinking the same if not better, I'm also exercising a lot like usual but this increases the throbbing pain. The headaches go from when i wake up to when I sleep and the pain increases and decreases randomly through the day. Hopefully this gives enough info for someone to shed so light on this because it's not a good feeling!I'm 16 and I've been having headaches for a number of weeks now.

Headache,Anxiety or Tumour? ,"I've almost always stressed over something medical related. So when my headache started a few days ago I instantly thought about brain tumors. I've been under a lot of stress because of recent events so I convinced myself it was just because of that. However, the headache hasn't eased in the slightest and it feels different from my previous ones. I looked up online and now I've got the idea that it's definitely a brain tumor. I'm going to the doctors tomorrow but I can't stop obsessing over the idea. I feel so scared and I just don't know what to do. My symptoms are:- Constant pain (throbbing) on the left side of my head.- My eyes are sore.- I'm sleeping more than usual.- I have a twitch in my right thumb. - My eyes are a little all over the place but nothing too serious yet. I'm sure there's more. I'm sorry for posting so much, I just can't stop worrying. Has this happened to anyone else? I'm convinced I'm going to die, and even that makes me feel stupid. "

Tried paracetamol, cocodamol and paracetamol nothing works. Had mri last tuesday so until results come back doctor wont give me anything. I've suffered with migranes for years so i don't think this is one. I'm fearing the worst as this is just relentless. I go to bed like this n wake up like this. I admit to being a bit of a worrier so maybe that's making it worse. Ive been on paroxetine in the past but ive not been on them for over a year now. At my wits end.

The only thing they could diagnose is ""migraine or tension headache without cause."" I went to a new family doctor 2 weeks later. He said it could be either my blood pressure, weight, or anxiety. But I've had weight and anxiety issues for several years now and never had this until 6 weeks ago. I've had blood drawn and lab work done, which the doctor said came back perfect. He put me on blood pressure medicine and then doubled it. It didn't help the headaches, and the neck soreness actually worsened. I've tried staying more hydrated, consuming less caffeine, eating better, practicing better posture, getting more sleep, different pillows, pain killers, essential oils and herbal treatments. I am open to all your advice and recommendations. Thank you. I'm a 44-year-old, non-smoking, non-drinking American male.

Headache,Brain pressure at the back of head for almost three weeks.,"Hi all, I'm not good at putting a story together so I'll just spew what I've been experiencing. I've had this head pressure at the back of my head running into my neck since the 15/02/16 and the feeling has been a dull, weird, slight discomfort type of sensation and at times it would be constant. For the entire duration my fingers and hands have been in a way jittery/ twitchy? Not really though just a miniscal amount but if I were to put into perspective; for me, when I type, it's natural, I can touch type with ease and type fast as well but since I've had this problem I've had to focus more on ""brain power"" as you will into typing with ease and I would miss hit the wrong key or something along these lines. Moving my mouse as well has been the same. If I were to put it down into two words, they would be weird and different. I have to say though as the week goes past, it has become a little easier and in a sense back to normal and natural only slightly though.Another symptom I've been experiencing is dizziness, there would be times where I would feel lightheaded in a way and just dizzy. I would also stumble back a step and lose balance basically. When I talk, people say it sounds normal but I know in myself that when I talk it's different and something isn't normal, it's almost like I can feel a slight stutter when I talk, this has improved over time though but I can notice it every now and then. Last week, I was restless in bed, I couldn't really sleep but this may have been down to my sleeping pattern being terrible. This week however sleeping has been okay. Now I find that when I take Naproxen and/or paracetamol, majority of these symptoms go away, I'm typing right now as we speak with relative ease.I've been to see my GP three times now within the duration of this occuring, I've seen two doctors and both have said across the three appointments that it is a tension headache and muscle tension in the neck. They both don't believe it's anything sinister and said that it isn't a tumour nor is it anything neurodegenerative. In fact one of the doctors have said and I quote ""I will be happy to bet a wad of cash and say it's not Motor Neurone Disease nor is it anything neurodegenerative"". Now the other doctor who I saw twice, actually I saw them on Thursday and they said it's not a tumour and they also had a feel of my ear lymph nodes on my face and on my left side, they said that there is a lymph node there that is bumpy, they then proceeded to examine my ear and had a look inside the left ear and said that my left ear drum was red. She checked the right side and I think they said that was fine but I didn't quite hear because they was talking.I also have asked my friend who is a junior doctor and have told him everything I've told you and he said a tension headache doesn't sound too far fetched and that ""with these headaches, the best way to fix them is to relax"", he advised that I get a massage and just relax really. With all this being said, I'm not really stressed to be honest, I'm a pretty chill guy and take things easy. Nothing at the moment is causing me much stress except for this problem I have, I don't even know what it is, so I'll just say problem/ illness. Blood pressure, temperature have all been normal throughout all three appointments.I was recommended in my first appointment to go see an optician of which I saw today and they said, they didn't find anything wrong except my glasses prescription had changed a little but to be honest I barely wear my glasses anyway. I have astigmatism in my eyes and it doesn't really affect me too much hence I only wear them on occasion.Now with all this cleared up, the symptoms are still there. It's sort of on and off really now, I have days where I feel normal and great and I have days like today where it's back again. What I don't understand is, how does a headache/ pressure last almost three weeks? Now I've been told that ""three weeks in the world of medicine isn't too long"" by said friend doctor. I'm honestly confused as to what is wrong with me and would like to find out and just be rid of it really. Any help is appreciated.Thank you "
Headache,Hi. Ive been getting headaches at the back of part of my EVERYDAY. What should i do?,"Ive been getting a lot of headaches recently. Before this happened, I had dizziness and most of the time i am dizzy, sonet"
Headache,"I have been suffering from a medical phenomenon for 6 months, what should I do?","Personal info:-male-16 y/o 6 months ago:I started to notice that my eyes would get watery. At the time, I didn't think much of it becuase there was no pain involved and I thought it might be casued by looking at electronic screens for too long. 5 months ago: I morning during summer vacation, I was about to take a shower before starting my day. Before I entered the shower, I noticed a black spot on my toe . That black spot was not a birth mark and I had not ever seen it prior to this day. My initial reaction was to wipe it off. When it didn't come off, I started to panic. Immediately, I began to research skin cancer and different types of melanomas. Based off of what i read off the internet and the spot on my foot, I was certain I had skin cancer. This caused me great fear and anxiety. When I went to my appointment with my dermatologist, he checked out the spot and quickly dismissed it as being 'trapped blood' or a briuse. Even after that, I wasn't sure how to treat the spot but i had to take my doctor's word for it that i was not going to die of skin cancer. 4 months ago:For a couple of weeks I would wake up and I would feel a sharp pain in my left ear. I only felt this pain in the morning right after I woke up. I would never feel the pain throughout the day. One morning a severe headache accompnied the ear pain the moment I woke up. To this day, 4 months later, the headache has not gone away. The only difference is the severity in which I feel the headache. I feel a numbness on the top right side of my head and on the right side of my face (bridge of nose, forehead). I feel as if there is water sitting on my head or if someone has their hand on my head. This headache caused me anxiety becuase I thought that I had a brain tumor or an anuerysm. I had an MRI done of my brain with brain stem and it was clear. I also had blood work done. Everything in the blood work came out good except that bilirubin was slightly high. I also had a urine test that was clear of abnormalities. 3 months ago: I started to experience diarrhea and irriatable bowels as well as excessive belching. These symtoms have lasted until the present (3 months). I might get healthy solid stool once a week. The diarrhea is loose but not watery. There is no blood in the stool and it is not black. I also began to experience trouble swallowing around this time. I went to an Ear, Nose, Throat doctor and he diagnosed me with having acid reflux because my larynx was inflammed and because of the excessive belching. 2 months ago:At random moments during the day, my hands would tremor slightly. I would also get cramps and muscle spasms in my abdomen and legs. These symtoms worry me becuase it makes me think that I might have Parkinsons's or Lou Gerhig's Disease (ALS/Motor Neurone).1 month ago;My bladder, lower back, and pelvic area began to ache. About a week later, I started to feel a dull ache in my right testicle. I still that pain in my right testicle during the day. I have checked my testicle for lumps, but I dont find any. My testicle is not swollen or inflammed, it just aches. I am afraid that I have testicular cancer and I am going to die or that I am going to have to live with only one testicle. During the past six months, I have tried to research and browse the internet to find what illness that I could have. In these efforts, my fears led me to cancer websites. On these cancer websites I would read about how teenagers would be diagnosed with cancer during the primes of their lives. Undoubtedly, I am afriad that all the aforementioned syntoms are the caused as a result of cancer. More so, I have developed great stress, anxiety, and anger toward cancer. I truly wish that babies, children, teenagers, and young people did not have to suffer and die from cancer. I hope that there is a person that is able to fadvise me I should do next. I really want to feel healthy and feel good again. I want to live. "
Headache,Funny feeling ,"Yes, I just recently started feeling the same symptoms a few weeks ago. My neck aches where I'm cracking my neck all throughout the day. I feel disconnected sometimes like I'm going to be paralyzed almost. I'm cold at times and get a tingling sensation in my face. My fingers tense up and I feel like I'm loosing mobility in them for a minute. My body aches. Inside of my mouth also feels swollen but it's not. I have found cough drops and hot tea helps it go away for awhile. I just went to the ER and they did bloodwork, urine test, mri, EKG and everything came back good. I have a referral to go see a neurologist. It's crazy, I'm super healthy, eat right, exercise and I'm 45. I do have a little bit of anxiety which I take nothing for. Any suggestions????

Headache,Migraines and chronic daily headaches,"I have been dealing with migraines/headaches for 18 years, I have had a lot of struggling finding relief as I have a chronic headache every day all day for the past 13 years. The headaches can be a 2 to 6 on a pain scale and usually I have taken over the counter meds like excedrin to manage the pain. Recently I found a prevention medicine for my migraines that works pretty well 1 every 2 months however my daily headaches persist. I stopped taking the over the counter meds to see if they were caused by that but no such luck and now I'm starting to get stronger migraines again. My doctor just prescribed me a Amitriptyline on top of my prevention med and wanted to see if anyone has experienced this combination and or advice for my situation? Thanks in advance "

Headache,SUNCT/SUNA,"Hello, my name is Sarah and I have been suffering with SUNCT/SUNA for 12 years, although was only diagnosed 5 years ago. I have tried all medication without success, some of which made me very ill (Lamotrigine and Phenytoin gave me Stevens-Johnson Syndrome). I had an occipital nerve stimulator fitted in 2012 which improved the attacks slightly I think although it's hard to tell because around the same time I started to take high levels of oestrogen via HRT patches. I have always maintained that my headache disorder has something to do with hormones but I can't get to the bottom of it and the specialists seem to dismiss it. I have just undergone Microvascular Decompression which has been unsuccessful. I feel absolutely desperate at the moment. I'm not sure how everyone on here is measuring their attacks but a good day/night for me is around 30 pains an hour at 2/3 out of 10 on the pain scale which is manageable and I have never managed more than 8 weeks at this level. However at worst it can be 200+ an hour at 10/10. I experience pain on both sides of my head but mainly on the right and never both sides at once. The only pain relief I can get is through the use of Oramorph which is not ideal. I seem to get relapses every few years of which I am experiencing at the moment which started before the surgery and I can't seem to get more than 1-2 days at the manageable level; the rest of the time it's 7-9/10. I have done lots of research and have recently found a case in America of a man who has used Clomiphene citrate (a fertility drug) and has had complete alleviation of his symptoms - I am awaiting confirmation that I can start this drug. Other than this it would appear that my only and last option is deep brain stimulation which I am not keen to have. Three weeks after surgery I developed pins and needles in my hand and foot and shortly afterwards developed blurred vision in my right eye with a fully dilated pupil which righted itself 24 hours later. I can't have an MRI scan due to the battery in my chest for ONS. CT scan confirmed no bleed. Questions for fellow SUNCT sufferers:1. Can anyone else link their SUNCT syndrome to hormones?2. Did your mum receive hormone injections during her pregnancy?3. Has anyone tried Clomiphene?4. Has anyone had relief from DBS?5. Does anyone have MS with SUNCT?Have tried to keep this brief but so much has gone on in the last 12 years. "
Headache,Daith piercing for chronic migraine.,"FYI - I suffer from migraines 24/7 and have for 6 years now. I'd suffered from ""regular"" migraines for 30 years before they became constant. A week ago I got my daiths (pronounced doths) pierced a little over a week ago and am happy to report that even though I still have the migraines daily, they are much less painful. My pain on a good day was an 8 on the 1 to 10 pain scale. Since the daith piercing, a good day is a 4 or 5. To me this is finaminal! My niece who was having 15 or more per month is now down to 3 per month. I highly recommend having it done.FYI - I suffer from migraines 24/7 and have for 6 years now.

I still feel unbalanced a lot now.About 3 months ago a headache began, its in one side of my head and will usually throb if I cough and feel a deeper pressure if I bend forward. I get total relief from the headache for a few hours if I take ibuprofen. Also occasional it will throb quite painfully for a few seconds.In the past week I have had 3 severe vertigo attacks. The room feels like it is spinning , and everything whooses when I move my head. They last under 5 minutes. I t makes me feel so panicked when it happens.I have severe agoraphobia. Do going to a doctor feels impossible for me just thinking about it makes me want to cry with anxiety. I am so scared that he will tell me I need a scan at the hospital - I would not cope I could not get in one of those machines.At the same time living with these symptoms if having a serious effect on my mental health.

Headache,Strange sudden headache,"I just had a very strange experience. I bent over, and suddenly it was like there was water in my nose, but only in one nostril. And then my left nostril got all runny, and so did my left eye, and I got this intense pain on the left side of my head, but not just in like my sinuses, my whole head. The pain has mostly subsided now after a couple of minutes, but this has never happened to me before and it kinda freaked me out. What happened? "
Headache,Strange head symptoms?,"Hi, I'm looking for anyone who can give me advice on my symptoms until I can get an appt with my GP. For the last few months I have had various symptoms that have seemed to gradually get worse. These symptoms include:- Headaches. Can be throbbing, pressure feeling or sharp. - Sudden sharp pains localised in one spot on head. - Dizziness- Feeling like I'm about to pass out. - Hearing problems/ear pain on and off- Eye pains (sharp) sudden onset lasting 30 seconds then stop. - Tingling feeling in back. It's always localised in the exact same spot and feels like there's something crawling under skin (For any women reading this, the sensation is in the area where your bra fastener sits)- Strange smell/sensation in nose that'll last seconds and straight after that I'll become very dizzy. - Mood changes - get very irritated very easy. - Periods seem to be becoming further and further apart. - Eyelid twitches whenever I yawn, blink heavily, or scrunch my eyes closed. Does anyone have any ideas what all these symptoms could mean? I went to see my GP about 3 months ago about the headaches, dizziness and light headed but she dismissed it as migraines. "
Headache,"Strange pressure in the head, feeling detached from surroundings, getting anxiety","Hi. I am a 16yo male coming up on 17. The symptoms i am experiencing are: a strange pressure in my head that isnt painful but very annoying. It sometimes comes round to the bridge of my nose. My voice to myself sounds strange for some reason. I feel detached from my body although i still control my thoughts/ what i do etc. but i also feel like im living in a dream state. I sometimes get mildly bad anxiety (usually at night). All these symptoms are scaring me since i think im developing a mental disorder. I read in places that something in the neck can cause these symptoms and i hope thats it. Oh and another thing to mention is that when i press on the lower back left or right of my head in the soft part, the pressure in my head is felt. When i do things that require focus, i completely forget about my symptoms for the most part. I have had these symptoms for about 4 weeks now and they have been worsening and i dont know what to do. I cant currently see my gp or anyone i can talk to since im on holiday in spain, and i dont want to tell my parents because i dont want them to worry. If anyone can help me, it would be greatly appreciated."
Headache,Headaches plus other symptoms feeling v scared...,"HelloI have never been one for headaches apart from in my last pregnancy.I started with constant headaches 5 months ago but this co-incided with starting a new drug for anxiety called citalopram. I just put it down to a side effect but rather than it get better after time it has got worse to the point I decided to quite quickly come off the tablets after 4 months of these headaches.The headaches are like a heavy head/dull pressure type pain. Its over whole head but worst behind eyes. It felt alot like eye strain.After coming off the tablets headaches are even worse I thought due to withdrawal symptoms but its now four weeks after stopping.I also have an awful stiff neck and pain into lower skull. Lower back pain, flashes of sudden dizziness especially when moving my eyes.I have this headache 24/7 it never goes not even with extra strong pain killers.It is worse at night and in morning and when I wake and turn on side I feel really nauseous.I have bad brain fog feeling like I can't get on with anything and trouble looking after two demanding young kids as I am in constant pain.Has anyone else suffered these same symptoms, constant headache, head pressure, nausea and dizziness?I'm so scared that there is something not right and have been to the doctors who are going to refer me to neurologist. However my hospital is under staffed and have been told waiting list could be over 6 months they are not even sure if they are taking on new patients. So not sure where this leaves me?From a v scared mummy "

Headache,Random sharp pinches/throbbing pain at the back of the head.,"Briefing: I'm scheduled to have an MRI soon, but would like some insights on what I may be suffering from. I also had a blood test recently which came out fine with no abnormalities, however, I'm beginning to become anxious of what this pain may be.Location of Pain: Back of my head on the left side, at a position opposite my left eye. The area where I feel this pain is within the red box in the uploaded picture.Duration of Pain: Been suffering for the past 2 months.Details: Sometimes I feel a sharp painful pinch that's always at the same spot. Sometimes it feels like a throb, but nonetheless it's painful enough to make me clench the area for relief and make me space out for just a slight moment. Once the pain starts occurring it seems like head movements, maybe even eye movements, seem to trigger the pain. When I'm not in pain, I feel great. When I feel the pain, my mood goes down completely as I pray it does not happen again.Timing of Pain: It's unpredictable, although, the pain did occur for 2 hours today when I started sobbing over a depressing life event. The pain always lasts for less than a second. Sometimes the pain only occurs once and stops. However, sometimes it may even recur at random intervals for several minutes. This pain appears to be happening at least once every 1-2 days.What helps: While laying down, I massage and apply pressure at the area of pain, it seems to slow down the frequency of the pains most of the time.Other Symptoms: Infrequent sinus headaches; my sinus inside my nose has been pretty inflamed for the past summer and my other sinuses such as those behind my cheek and eyebrowns feel slightly pressured. My left eye seems a little blurred, but it's been like that for a while."

Headache,"'Brain fog' for almost a week now, please help","Hi all, I came back from a long overseas trip a little more than a week ago and a day or two after i arrived i started having this weird sensation in my head. I dont think its a fully blown headache but I feel slightly out of touch sometimes, my head feels heavy and i have this dull feeling at the base of my skull on the left side, which is really worrying me. Ive also had a runny nose which started a day or two after my head.

Its been almost a week of this constant on and off 'brain fog', and I've been really worried about it ever since it started( the waterworks were in full swing for an entire weekend)any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciatedThanks"
Headache,Mild headache and slight dizziness for 5 days straight,"Ok, so for about 5-6 days or so(after 2-3 days from recovering from sun poisoning), I've been having mild headaches and slight dizziness. In the first days I also had slightly blurred vision and problems concentrating. Now, I'm only dizzy and having mild headaches. The curious thing is, I mainly get the dizziness and the headaches ONLY if I don't do anything(like staying in bed or sitting down on a chair). If I exercise(eg. run or even walk), they both go away. Also, I've noticed that putting pressure(while standing) on my head temples relieves the mild headache. Now, I'm really scared of the possibility of a brain tumor and I'm wondering if anyone else had these symptoms and if so how did they get them treated(apart from running 24/7). Should I worry? The headaches are really mild, so mild that I'd only classify them as dizziness but they are clearly distracting.

I had a CT scan and nothing was discovered so I was just told to live with it.I have been struggling with headaches and migraines ever since, but within the last month they've gotten worse.I've had a headache every day for the past week and half, both my temples feel swollen and hurt and my neck is so tight.I feel sick due to the pain in my head. Regular painkillers do nothing for me.Right now as I'm typin this, my brain feels as though it's bursting out of my skull.I don't want to go to the doctor only to be turned away and told to 'deal with it' anymore.If nothing dodgy showed on the CT scan, then what is wrong with me? This pain is severely affecting my life, I can't get out of bed when it's like this. Please any suggestions or help? I'm so desperate "

Headache,Headache with vision changes & balance issues,"I've had a constant mild headache for a few months now. I figured it was due to my fibromyalgia. Over the past couple days, I've noticed that my vision gets blurry sometimes & I get dizzy/off-balance. I went to urgent care & the doctor said it wasn't due to high blood pressure or sinus issues. She gave me an anti-inflammatory shot that did nothing. Any idea what is causing this? I will definitely be talking to my regular doctor about this but I don't see him until next week.

Headache,Suffering from anxiety disorder especially health anxiety (hypochondria),"After a kind of break up and i m only 16 haha, my heartbeat gradually and my heart started pounding. At first i thought it is due to the break up but after 2 or 3 days i decided to google it. Dr google asked me strictly to go to a doctor as dr google thought i had heart disease. I went through depression after i read that all and decided to make an appoimtment with an cardiologist. He did an ecg and some blood tests and everything came back normal. Then i was happy but after some days i started worrying about every sensation in my body and always checked and searched about sensations on google which always suggested some terrifying diseases. Many times after that i went to the doctor with some new fears and everytime he said its just anxiety. I went through many fears like cancers, kidney diseases etc. The things which made me feel better was reading that all the symptoms from which I was suffering from like tingling sensations,bad breathing and many more were anxiety symptoms. But after knowing it all it was hard to believe that these all are just anxiety symptoms. Now i was feeling very better few weeks back but now again anxiety is back. I m suffering from headaches and head pressure and some weird sensations in my head like prickling and numbness and tightness in scalp and in back of the head and neck. I also feel like pressure on ear and like ear fullness. I always think about the worst possible and these symptoms puts me in fear all the time. But some times i also feel really relax and all these symptoms dissappers when i try to calm myself. Some of my family members also suffer from anxiety but we dont talk so much so i better decided to write here to get help from some people who have suffered from this type of health anxiety and want to know from u people that how u have get through this.

Headache,Constant headache with other unexplained symptoms,"Hoping someone can offer some advice, as I'm completely fed up. I'm a 33 y/o female with a history of migraines. I've always been able to control them in the past fairly easily with medication such as relpax. During pregnancy, they were pretty much non existent and post partem, I maybe get one every 6 months.However, the last few months or so, I've been getting the worst dibilitating headaches around my eyes, made worse with movement. I've been taking OTC meds daily, which only take the edge off. I'm currently into week 2 with the same headache. It has not stopped at any time during the day. I go to bed with it, and wake up with it. Also over the last few months, I have been experiencing fevers; some reaching 104, with no additional symptoms. Last time I saw my Dr, he said tension, which didn't make sense to me with the fever. Since I've seen my family Dr last, the headaches keep reoccurring and now recently I have had extreme back pain on one side as well as severe tendon pain in shoulder. Took antibiotics for possible kidney infection, and the pain is back again. I can't even function feeling like this, these headaches are going to be the death of me.

Headache,"Sudden blurred vision, feeling out of it, fatigue, neck stiffness, tightness in throat for 5 months.","HI there, I want to start by saying that I am going to be as thorough as possible with this post so be patient as I will be entering a lot of information starting with when my symptoms started exactly. For starters, I recently turned 20 years old and am entering my third year of University. I am an athlete and have been active and in good health my entire life. About 5 months ago, I was living a pretty normal life until one day my symptoms started. I remember it like it was yesterday, I hadn't gotten much sleep one night and had also been drinking that night. The next morning I had to wake up early to help set up for a super bowl watch party. Obviously I was sort of hungover but I didn't feel any different than usual. My friend and I went to the store to get some stuff, and suddenly I started feeling a strange ""out of it"" sensation. I felt dizzy, had blurred vision, and I remember having a tight sensation in my throat or feeling like there was a ball stuck in it. I figured maybe it was from the drinking and although I was worried I figured it would be gone when I woke up in the morning. Well, it didn't go away the next day and a day later when I was walking on campus towards my first class, I just couldn't make it there and felt like I was going to pass out. Since these symptoms first started, I have had good days and bad days, but ultimately my main symptoms have been blurred vision, a constant brain fog, sensitivity to sound and light, stiff feeling in back of neck and base of skull, fatigue, feeling like there is a notch in my throat. To date, I have had blood tests done, blood sugar tested, blood pressure, and an eye exam. Also it's not my heart because I had an EKG done a year ago when I was having shoulder/chest pain, turned out to be muscular. i have also been given sinus and migraine medication even though I knew it wasn't either of those causes. Ever since this started it has affected my grades, as I have had to walk out on exams for fear of passing out, it is affecting my personal relationships because anytime someone wants to hangout I just feel like I can't because I feel out of it and don't feel up to do anything at all. I have been working our 4-5 days a week since I was in high school it has been extremely hard to keep on working out since this started. I am tired a lot and have no drive. Based on my symptoms the main things that I think it could be and haven't been tested for would be a chiari malformation, lyme disease, Atlas sublexation in my neck, or something else. If any of you have any information that may help me with this, I would be so grateful, I really just want my life back and will do anything to get better. Thank you. Let me know if you need any more info. "

Headache,"Headache for 2 weeks. Left side, floaters, pain medication not working. ","Two weeks ago I suddenly got a headache over my lunch break. It was quite severe and wouldn't go, even after I drank my weight in water and took a variety of pain relievers (paracetamol, ibuprofen, coedine etc).

Headache,Monthlong Headache No Relief Please Help,"Hi there. I am a 23-year-old female, usually in very good health. I woke up with a throbbing pain in my left temple over a month ago that has moved behind my ears, behind my eyes, and into the back of my head. I have a history of migraines but nothing like this before.I got two torradol shots at the beginning of the migraine, three days apart. I took fioracet, maxalt, immitrix, narcotics including percacet, vicodin, and tramadol, and nothing has brought me relief.I have been to the ER twice when I could not keep down food anymore. Thefirst time I got a mixture of benadryl, torradol, and regalin. I went back a few days later and they gave me morphine, torradol, and regalin. Still the headache would not break.My CT is normal. I have been to a neurologist, who gave me an occipital nerve block shot. Nothing has worked. She seems to not be able to help me at this point. Please - anyone who has any advice, ideas, or similar experiences. I haven't left bed in a month and desperately want my life back. Please help."

Headache,Headaches and side effects,Have been having tension type headaches for a few months. Eyes checked new glasses everything ok. Nothing would relieve the pain. Went to GP told me to stop all pain killers still no joy. Because of my health anxiety I was becoming concerned it was somethings more serious. She said she could not find anything and put me on a new drug Topiramate 50mg. The pain carried on then I began to feel vey nauseous and off my food. A week later I woke up to a loud banging in my head and the noise and pain continued. Because of the noise I could not sleep so I had time off work. I returned to my GP who I do have a good relationship with and asked for a private referral to a neurologist. I do get some of the cost paid with my Westfield insurance. The next day I managed to sleep a couple of hours but woke up to fairy lights blinking around the room I was terrified. I went yesterday to see the neurologist and he said there was no tumour but my brain had gone into overdrive and was over sensitive to everything. I thought this might help anybody who might be having problems. The mind can play terrible tricks. He also said no more meds for 5 weeks. Still in pain and a brass band playing in my ear but no lights
Headache,Brain inflammation is it common?,2months back I went to a gp and did a ct scan. He found something in that report which at times he said is inflammation or sinus or allergies (yes i have food intolerance i suppose). He prescribed me medecins for Pakinson disease which I did not take. Later I had some very terrible bursting headache and dizziness and confusion. I was admitted to the clinic and did MRI of cervical and brain which was clear. I repeately have stiff neck which result in pain in the head and fast heart beat. Its so horribleAnyone familiar which these symptoms? I am 29.Thank you for your reply.

Headache,Headaches. Could this be an answer for some?,"I've had headaches for a couple of years now and I take pregabalin - previously I took gabapentin. I eagerly follow this site for help.My mum kept on at me to try an old wives remedy of keeping away from cheese. I started that last Thursday and it's been working quite well. However, it's now Tuesday and the headache came back this morning! I don't normally have headaches in the morning. All I had to eat earlier was a banana in addition to my usual porridge. I figured that the banana had to be problem. So I did an internet search for ""foods that give headaches cheese banana"". There were many results which pointed to sites detailing something in foods called Tyramine. Now I'm no doctor and I can't fully digest the explanations but if any of you people are able to understand, I'd appreciate the ""layman's"" explanation. To my untrained ""with a headache"" brain, it's telling me that aged foods produce tyramine and that interacts in the brain to give headaches. I have also found a list of foods to avoid. What I would now like to know is how do I get rid of tyramine (because I now have a headache) when I've just eaten something I didn't realise contained tyramine. Will drinking fluids help....or do I take paracetamol....or do I have to sit it out? "

Headache,"Started as a migraine, now pressure headaches for 3 weeks","Hello all,My name is Brandon and I am 23 years old. Recently i've had a number of stressful things happen, such as a new job change potential/promotion, and the soon arrival of my 2nd child. I suffer from anxiety pretty bad, and the job interviews and what not definitely triggered me along with scrambling and finding time to work on the nursery, etc. I have not been to a doctor for an official anxiety diagnosis but I know I suffer from it. I must add that I do physical work during the day for 8+ hours, and I am sitting at a desk for 6+ hours on the computer at home. This all started when I got home from work about 3 weeks ago, I came home and my daughter had the house looking a mess so I was scrambling around and cleaning with her. Once I sat down finally I noticed sort of an arc in my right eye and was not sure what it was so I rubbed my eyes for a bit and sat there. Then came the migraine which was on the left side of my head. I have never had a migraine before so this was surprising to me as I wasn't sure what it was at first. I went and grabbed an ice pack and laid down in bed for a couple hours to sleep it off. I woke up and my vision was pretty normal and the pain mostly gone. It might have been the next day, or a day after, I started feeling pressure in my head like a vice, with mild pain nothing crazy. I figured it would go away on its own so I ignored it. I am now on the 3rd week of this feeling, which the mild pain comes and goes through out the day. I don't feel any pain usually when I wake up, but it starts up through out the day randomly and ranges from the back of my head, to the sides, sometimes the crown just random. I sleep pretty messed up as well because when I wake up my neck and shoulders are tight, and my back sometimes as well. I have no real sensitivity to light, nausea, or loss of appetite. Any OTC painkillers I have tried havent really done much, the pain isnt terrible I just wanted to see how it would respond to it, so I deal with it. Also have some mild pain in what feels like my jaw near my temples but nothing crazy. Also the pain has never amplified it's stayed pretty constant for these 3 weeks in terms of intensity.The pressure feeling and mild pain is more of a nuisance to me than anything but I am worried since this has been going on for 3 weeks now. Has anyone ever experienced anything like this?Thank you!"
Headache,"I'm happy, healthy, except for these daily headaches!!","Hello, I'm suffering from daily headaches and sofar , I (and my doctor) haven't been able to find out what the cause might be. Here is my story.It all started 5-6 months ago. I had maybe once a month this ""headache attack"". The scenario goes like this:It starts slowly, on more or less random moments. Builds up to a maximum in 10-15 minutes where it really starts hurting. It goes up linear, without pulsating. Then it slows down and disappears after 15 minutes. So the whole cycle lasts 20-30 minutes. When it happens, I have tears coming out of my eyes and my nose running. I have difficulty in keeping my left eye open. The pain is intense and precisely located in the top left of my brain and left temple.In the beginning it was always during the evening between 21:00 and 24:00.Then, it became twice a month. Than once a week. And since 3-4 weeks it's every day. Once or twice a day. Either afternoon, either evening, either during the night when I sleep and it wakens me up. Never in the morning.When it happens, I take some paracetamol, but that just reduces the pain a bit. I had an MRI (with injection) done. Result: nothing.Before and after the attack, everything is perfect. I have no pain, dizzyness or other symptoms. I'm a 59 year old male and I have a pretty stressless life. No worries whatsoever. I take no pills or medicins whatsoever.I work at home and I spend quite a lot of time behind my computer, but I take care that I'm in the right position, have the right glasses, a good screen, and I take a break every 45-60 minutes.As far as food/drink is concerned. I do drink alcool . So I tried changing that. Other drinks, no drinks. But no change. Similar for smoking. My nutrition, which is maybe not the healthiest in the world, has been the same for the last 15 years, so I don't see any relation with that either.I'm running a bit out of ideas. If anyone here recognizes the same symptoms, I would like to hear from you, and especially what you did to cure it.Thank a lot in advance. "
Headache,"Constant headaches for over a year now, please help","I am 16 and have been suffering with constant headaches for over a year now. Recently the pain seems to be getting worse, it is interferring with my studies and daily activities. Some days the pain is so bad I am bedridden as when I get out of bed I am hit with a chronic headache along with dizziness and nausea as well. I am currently doing my A-levels and so studying is difficult when I wake up and go to sleep with a headache, but I persist with the pain. At first I coped with the pain and had a positive attitude, as I told myself that sooner or later the pain would ease or go comletely. But it has got to a point now where I just don't know what to do anymore, no pain killers or chiropractor or acupuncture can give me any sort of relief. I have recently tried triptans and have even been prescribed Topiramate but nothing has worked. It is slowly having a psychological effect on me, some days I just go into the garden or some place quiet and cry to myself. I try to stay strong for my family as they worry so much, as do my friends but I just don't know how long more I can last. I just want to know what it's like not to have a headache.Please, if you have any advice, or even if you just have similar stories or experiences share as it will be much appreciated,Katie"

Headache,Head aches and neck pains every day.,I am 16 years old and i have neck pains every day and seem to get head aches a lot almost every day.

Headache,I started getting cluster headaches for two years,"I began getting cluster headaches since I was 59. I've done a lot of research but nobody seems to have any real answers. I did use oxygen at the very start of the last one and did manage to abort it but I understand that only works a small % of the time. These clusters hit hours before I wake in the a.m., and drag on for 65-70 days. The nausea is awful. I also get migraines, runs in the DNA, during the cluster on the opposite side of my head. Anyone have any helpful suggestions? I sometimes feel like Edward Scissorhands live inside my skull."
Headache,"Headache, neck stiffness, should I insist on a CT scan?","Already seen a doctor and been given muscle relaxants for my neck. I'm male 43, normal blood pressure, no smoking, some drinking, some family stroke history.The reason I saw the doctor is that for about a week I've had an unusual headache in back of head (I never get headaches) accompanied by neck stiffness that comes and goes (sometimes severe on tilting back, hurts after a certain angle when turning side to side). No other symptoms, no nausea etc.My concern is whether this could be a missed warning sign for a brain bleed. Should I insist on a CT/CTA scan? I'm planning to be on a fairly remote beach in three weeks and it would be hard to get urgent medical care quickly if anything happened.Thanks for any insights!"

Headache,Chronic Headaches for Years?,"Hey all. Basically I am unsure as to if I suffer from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (now) or just an overall headache issue. Around 2.5 years ago, I got the flu and was left with HORRID fatigue that never got better up until now. But, the fatigue and other symptoms associated with CFS gradually improved, and I have learned to deal with it currently. My headaches have been bad since 3 years ago when this all began, but now I would say it is my worst symptom. Unlike many CFS sufferers, exersize makes me feel way better. I have no brain fog, soar throats, soreness, Post exertional malaise, nada. But, I still suffer intensely from horrrible exhaustion and the worst, HEADACHES.Lets forget the fatigue part for a second. Usually, I will wake up with a simple tension headache in my neck area. I will continue my day, sometimes taking advil in the morning. As the day progresses the headache gets worse. It moves from the neck to my temples, to the front of my head, and then back to my neck area. Lately (the last month), tylenol/advil have not helped me much at all. I do not get migraines, but my headaches feel like they are SO CLOSE to becoming migraines, but do not. What has helped me a little and also sometimes made things worse, is marijuana use. I also get a bit nauseous from my headaches. I am starting to wonder this: Am i slowly recovering from CFS, am I backtracking, OR are the constant headaches causing me to be more tired than normal?Lastly, I know that headaches are a major symptom of CFS, but to be honest, I suffer from only really headaches and fatigue, maybe one is causing the other? Thanks all!"
Headache,Chronic Tension Headache,"Hi one and all. I must start by saying that of many websites about matters to do with headaches and in particular chronic tension type headaches, this site is one of the best, if not the best I have come across. What comforted me (if that is an acceptable word for what people like me are going through?) is that there are many points on this site that have not been clearly stated elsewhere. And I found myself fitting into many of the symptoms the articles were describing. As a deep thinker, it made my mind relax just that wee bit more. I didn't want to think I had a tumour or ruptured blood clot, etc. Or maybe I still need to have a CT scan to rue this out, I don't know? My chronic headache started in mid- December 2014 and has continued daily ever since through to mid-May 2015 now! 5 months of a dull ache/pressure in the head with associated feelings of fatigue with possible eye strain (?) and every so often a period of anxiety with much stress, is by no means a pleasant experience. My GP described one person having a similar condition to mine but took one year to come out of it! In mid-December when things started for me, it was a really stressful period of being made suddenly redundant from my job and having my wife about to go in for a moderately serious operation in hospital and with a sudden death of a friend my age and having to find and move into another rental house because of being made redundant and our one dog becoming lame and needing a very expensive operation and other stuff I won't bore you with. I think my blood pressure and anxiety levels hit the roof and I am wondering just what 'damage' has been done. My head dull ache started fairly suddenly with what I would describe as a tension band around the back and sides of my head which left after about 3 weeks then what remained is what I have now, and I don't like it. I would say I'm about 30% less productive, feel lethargic often and wondering if this is also affecting my eyes due to me having prescription reading glasses about a year ago. Any thoughts or comments or helpful suggestions about what to do about all this and how to get through it? My GP just says to wait another few months to see how things go!"
Headache,The only headache remedy that works for me!,"I've had headaches daily for 15 years and tried about everything. The only thing that can stop my headaches in their tracks is heat! I fill a sock with rice and microwave it in 30 second intervals until warm. I put it on my face, neck, shoulders, anywhere I feel tension. Within minutes my headache fades away. It's amazing. It does what no medication can do for me. I like using the sock instead of a heating pad because it gives a little weight/pressure and forms around my face. Heating pads and ice packs don't do it for me but this is my saving grace. Might not work for all headache types but I wanted to share! Changed my life Enjoy!"
Headache,head pressure/ tension headache ," Basically I have constant pressure in my head that makes me so nauseous and drowsy. It is very uncomfortable makes me wanna just faint. my brain MRI was normal and I went to a neurologist and he gave me muscle relaxant and antidepressants that made me worse. I went to the emergency room and they didn't help they gave me Fioricet (Butalbital, Acetaminophen and caffeine) it helps but doesn't cure the issue. I'm scheduled to see a new neurologist tmw I hope I find a solution Bcse it's been 6 months since I'm suffering with this condition"
Headache,Vertigo/dizzy attack ,I had a constant pressure in my head I went to many doctors and they kept giving me headache/migraines meds which never helped. Then all of the sudden I had a dizziness attack where the pressure increased followed by lightheadedness numbness in legs and arms and neck pain almost passed out this attack was the key to diagnose my condition. The neurologist told me it was a vertigo/ dizzy attack which is most likely due to inner ear infection or nerve issue. my brain MRI was normal slightly hearing loss in one ear eng and vng tests are still pending. My ent on the other end said it is not an inner ear issue and my neck could be the cause of this dizzy attack. I'm now on meclizine and ear drops and I'm almost back to ky
Headache,"Just had a throbbing headache for 30 seconds, then it stopped, what is it?","No clue what happened, was sitting at my computer and my head started throbbing like a heartbeat for around 30 seconds and then it stopped. But I've never experienced anything like it. It actually hurt a lot.Now my neck is kind of sore.Anyone have any idea what this is?"
Headache,"Sharp, instant head pains, High Rheumatoid Factor. No Answers.","Hey everybody. So for about eight months I have been having these significantly sharp and intense head pains which feel like a popping followed by an instant sharp pain, located between my ears, and back of the head. This morning I woke up with what may be called a pressure headache, which is only produced when I cough, or bend over.I have had a CAT scan, and been to the doctors who have sent me to an ear specialist which showed nothing, and I am awaiting an appointment with a neurologist I have tried a chiropractor, having gone four times, but it only made the area he worked on sore a few months later, not lessening my pangs.I had a major spike in my Rheumatoid Factor which can happen to any healthy person, and will follow up in three months to determine whether or not to see a specialist for more testing.I am getting pretty sick of feeling fatigued all of the time, and while I drink nearly every day, I only usually have two, if that. Because of the headaches and fatigue I've gone without drinking for a few weeks and nothing has changed.One doctor recommended I take a very specific vitamin B, which I do.I have anxiety, and vesovegal with needles and heart palpitations, and am only 22 years old! Help."
Headache,How Do I Get Professional Advice For My Headaches,"Hi!?How do I get some professional advice for my headaches??I wouldn't mind finding a specialist online site with a headache specialist I can e-mail or do a live online chat with.?My doctor said it was a neurologist I need to see I think but is reluctant to send me to one for some reason. Obviously maybe cause he doesn't see any seriousness to them as such, which is probably right, but they're doing my head in excuse the pun.Thanks!"
Headache,Trying to find the source of my permanent headache ,"I'm going to try to explain this as best as I can without having to go through my entire history of symptoms which is long. I feel that some details cannot be omitted though in order to explain the nature of my headache so please bear with me.I have had fibromyalgia since my late teens (confirmed by a recent blood test) which first came as fatigue, cognitive dysfunction and nerve symptoms, then at 19 the muscle aches and sleep issues started to develop and the a permanent headache ensued in addition to all the classic fibromyalgia symptoms that afflict the nose, eyes, mouth, throat, bowels etc. You can say that the onset of symptoms and their intensities were gradual. I also have degenerative disc generation diagnosed at the age of 23 which seemed to come about gradually as well. The doctor's theory was that it was developing for quite a few years. I have TMJ, my jaw pops on the right when I open my mouth and it's painful at time. I'm 36 now and I've been practically disabled since my mid 20s which has made me resort to selling merchandise online as a means of living. Apart from the fatigue, I'd say my most debilitating symptom is my headache. It is very intense, never goes away, only eases once in a while and not enough to take me out of my misery. I haven't been able to get a hold of what intensifies or alleviates it and documenting my everyday life has not helped in catching a positive pattern. It just seems to be out of whack.Here's the best I can explain it. The pain seems to emanate from nerves in the back of my head towards the sides of head and on to the temples. There are several very painful trigger spots including temples, next to the eyebrows, upper sides of the head by the middle, where the ear meets the jaw and the muscles at the back of my skull. Let me also add that I have a lot of pain behind my eyes which fluctuates, very sore eyes and since 2013 I've developed permanent and mysterious blepharospasm (literally permanent eyelid twitching during my waking hours) which I'm supposed to get Botox shots for. It feels like a pressure headache and my ears pop at times, they also frequently pop when I move my eyes. I've been trying to find out the source of the headache while trying to treat the underlying symptoms of fibromyalgia but I haven't had any lasting success. Here's what I know it's notMigraine headache: does not fit the description and durationCluster headache: it's on both sides proportionallyStress: My life without my chronic condition would be nice and dandyTo the doctors that have been treating me, a few of my symptoms seemed very unusual and atypical of fibromyalgia so I'm opening my mind to the notion that I might have other complications. The closest literature I've found that describes my issue is occipital headaches but I'm really uncertain that this is it. I was diagnosed with pinched nerves in my back along with the DDD so I was wondering if there's a correlation. Could any issues in the back of the skull cause a permanent headache the way I described it? If any one has any plausible theories, please share. This has been an issue for over 10 years and has made me very desperate and miserable. Thank you. "
Headache,Sudden dull headaches lasting minutes,Has anyone experienced sudden onset of a dull headache and then colour draining from face which lasts a couple of minutes and then disappears.My husband has been experiencing these 'funny turns' for a few days often 3 or 4 times a day. This happened a few weeks ago and lasted about a week but then stopped. They have now reappeared and just wondered if anyone has experienced anything similar or has any idea why it could be happening. He does have high blood pressure which is managed with meducation and seems okay.
Headache,Headaches caused by physical exertion?,"I have been suffering from headaches along the front of my head when doing physical activity (i.e. manual labor/shoveling dirt, moving rocks). I drink a lot of fluids (water and coffee) prior to the headaches brought on by the manual labor. I am in my early 50's, have worked out nearly everyday lifting weights and cardio for the past 25 years, am not overweight and consider myself to be in excellent shape. I do not get the headaches when working out, just when bending, shoveling etc... I also have low/normal BP of 110/70 and a pulse of 58. I am hoping someone can help me out with a suggestion or tip. Thx"
Headache,Head lump causing pain. ,"Hey, so for about 3/4 years now I've had a small, pea sized lump on the top of my scalp. It's hard, doesn't move, looks smooth and red and hasn't grown in size. I've been to see a few nurses who have said it seems like a cyst but it's strange it doesn't move as scalp cysts typically can be moved under the skin. It occasionally causes pain and have been told it's usually infected when the pain starts, although there are no other signs of infection. Any advice? "
Headache,I've had a headache for 4 years. I'm perfectly healthy. They make me pass out. Any ideas? ,"I lead a healthy life, exercise, diet and sleep. I don't get stressed and I am a calm teenager. These headaches get worse with the lights and so much so that I pass out. Sometimes I almost have an electric shock-epilepsy episode before I pass out.This has been going on for 4 years and I have had every test from the doctors but they deem me fit and healthy. The headaches are very annoying and disrupt my A Levels and my previous GCSE's."
Headache,Migraines,Hi. Any advice welcome. I gave a 12 yr old son who has suffered from occasional migraines for a couple of years. They are now increasing in frequency and intensity. GP has prescribed tablets to reduce symptoms and referred us to the hospital for further investigation. At the moment have no idea of cause/triggers but seem to occur in afternoons/evening. He just wants to go to a dark room and sleep mainly to avoid nausea. Would like to hear from other parents who have children in similar situation. Foods/stimulants to avoid?. Treatment that has worked? Possible questions to ask Consultant when we do eventually receive an appointment. No family history of migraines. Thank you. Ps. My son has not reached puberty as I was thinking change of hormones because of the increased frequency of migraines. But just guessing.

Headache, Headache and constant brain fog,"Ok, so here's my story:For 2 years I went to the GP because I was getting these episodes of extreme fatigue. Blood tests were normal. Assumed it was just stress and anxiety. I keep going back and forth, but still nothing. Dull brain fog present, but I could live it. I've been doning everything I can exercising, sleeping right, eating healthy, you name it, but I would still get these episodes. They would come and go. There was a period when it seemed to dissapear, but only to come right backThen this year: I've been healthy, sleeping, working out, ignoring the fatigue and brain fog. I notice this I have a mild pressure at the top of my head (tension headache). I take ibuprofen and paracetamol for a week, nothing happens. Doesn't work (which was strange because it always works for my headaches). I up my dose of paracetamol and ibuprofen as prescribed by my physician. I take these for a week, nothing happens. I am then prescriped aspirin which I had to take for two weeks to remove this headache. I quit aspirin, the headaches are better. Then during easter vacation I suddenly get very very tired and fatigued. It was exhausting to stand upright, I had to lie down all the time. I would get very fatigued, nauseated and just feel weak upon standing. I would sleep all the time. I had this muscle weakness upon walking, it was difficult to walk. This lasted for about 4 days. I then get flue like symptoms, I feel sick, getting chills and feeling feverish, sore throat. This lasted for a week.Present: I get at least two headache attacks per day, they are really tension like. But for some reason I take pills for migrane attacks, which barely work. The headache relapses, then goes away after I take another pill. I also get sudden unpredictable attacks of exteme fatigue where I just feel annoyed, and get this weakness at the back of my neck and down my body. I then have to sleep. What bothers me the most though is that my memory seems to be deterioration more every day, my concentration is awful, I feel spaced out all the time, and I just don't want to do anything. I can barely remember anything these days. I cannot gather new info which is awful when your a student.I'm an 18 year old male. I have talked to two psychologists. It was clear I was not depressed, but had depressive symptoms which disappeared very quickly. I currently do not have symptoms of depression either, neither do I feel depressed. I have been diagnosed with social anxiety, but it really isn't bothering me anymore, it's become mild. Furthermore I've had an EKG, and MRI, complete blood tests, urine test and seen a neurologist. I seem healthy but I certainly do not feel that way at all. Can someone relate? If so, please reply so that maybe we can figure out what's going on together."

Headache,Headache for over a week.,"Hello I have been having the same type of headache for the past 5 years. When I have it, it lasts for over a week every single time and is always in the exact same spot; a small spot on the left side of my head, near the front. It always feels exactly the same; a dull pulsing ache which is on and off each day of the week that I have it. I don't think it's stress as I'm not stressed, it doesn't tie in with my periods, it can't be due to noise as I can sometimes just wake up with it and also it has no routine to it, meaning it just comes whenever, like sometimes it can be months and months until I have another one and other times it can be days.I am a 20 year old female and I have just been diagnosed with two types of nocturnal epilepsy this year. Please help me, I haven't been to the doctors as I didn't know if I should."
Headache,Trigeminal neuralgia,"I have been diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia, and prescribed tegremol. Been taking this for a week but no difference. Could any1 who suffers with this please help. The pains are so abrupt and severe that Ive already been back to doctor again this week. Ty in advance"
Headache,Ongoing headache/pain,"As I was going to sleep last Thursday night I felt a headache coming on. I was able to get to sleep without issue but woke early Friday morning with the headache in full force. The pain is focused on my left temple and at varying times extends down my jaw and to the top of my head (left side). I took a combination of paracetamol and ibuprofen on Friday and it went away fairly quickly. I felt nauseous for about 30 minutes that evening but it passed as soon as I ate something. I took another dose of paracetamol and ibuprofen just to be safe that night and woke up Saturday feeling fine until the evening when the pain came back. Since then paracetamol and ibuprofen haven't been able to touch it. The pain continued non-stop until Tuesday when after taking paracetamol and aspirin (switching out the ibuprofen) it seemed to clear up. I felt a pressure all day but it was largely pain free until I went to sleep that night and I woke up a few hours later with the exact same pain again. So it's now Wednesday and I'm still in pain. I have no other symptoms whatsoever. I read that migraines usually last between 4 and 72 hours with accompanying nausea but I haven't had any nausea apart from those 30 minutes on Friday evening. It varied from severe to dull but it was affecting my sleep. I'm sure it isn't sinus related because I don't have a cold or any other symptoms. The only time I've ever had an ongoing headache like this is because of sinus issues, but this isn't it I'm sure because I feel 100% fine otherwise. I feel better today and it's no longer severe but it's still there. I can always feel a pressure. I don't have any pain opening my jaws but it somehow feels like it could be the jaw joint.I'm a 25 y/o male. I get maybe one or two headaches per month but they're never an issue, just regular headaches. I've never once had a migraine as far as I know in the traditional sense of pain being accompanied by nausea, dizziness, vision issues, etc."

Headache,Is there something wrong with me?!,"I'm so sorry this is going to be such a long post!I will start with some basic information about me.I am 18 years old, currently in full-time college. I live in England and I am a female!Back when I was around 15, I had a knock to the head and this started chronic daily headaches.I have had blood tests for EVERYTHING and I still have frequent ones to make sure nothing has changed and everything is coming back normal.I have had an MRI, again came back normal.I started to become very tired about a year ago and thought it was to do with little sleep, so I now get about 8 hours sleep a night and it hasn't changed anything. Some days I have to leave college early due to either the severe headaches or I'm too tired to stay awake despite getting enough sleep, food, and drink.I then had tonsillitis in June last year (2015) It cleared with a course of antibiotics. It then kept coming back within about 4 times until September.Now ever since I have had swollen tonsils and a swollen gland which is about 2 - 3cm and hasn't gone down since (It's now March!)I went to the ENT specialist the other day and without even feeling my swollen lymph node in my neck, she could already see it when I lifted my head.She felt it and said it was quite big, and requested an urgent ultrasound and biopsy injection within the next 4 weeks.Here is a list of all the symptoms and other symptoms I am experiencing which I haven't said above are:- Chronic Headaches/Migraines- Tired 24/7- Tingling, aching, sharp pains around body- Swollen Neck Lymph Node since June 2015- Depression/Anxiety - I was sexually abused when I was 7 (Depression also runs in the family)- Balance Problems- Muscle Aches- Chest pains which come and go- Hair falls out a lot compared to years ago- Irregular Periods- Hyperactivity- Get hot really really quickly!!Medication I have been on are:- Pizotifen- Amatriptalyn- Lanzoparol- Propanalol- Sumatriptan- Topiramate - Made me faintAll of these medications made me really hyper and I was always getting the side effects rather than the benefit from the actual medication!I have also been taking B2 and Magnesium for about half a year.For my headaches, I have had Botox type A twice which has not helped at all!If anyone knows what is happening to me I'de be so so greatful, I'm so lost right now from all this!

Headache,Severe and frequent headaches,I'm a 15 year old girl and I have severe and frequent headaches. The pain doesn't stay in one spot and often happens on both sides of my head. I've been having this for a year or two now. They often cause photosensitivity and hinder my day to day activities. I think these might just be migraines but I get them so often. Does anyone know a way to get rid of them/reduce the pain. It's often a mixture of burning and sapping settles one more than the other. The burning feels like I have heartburn I'm my head.

Headache,Chronic Daily Headache Sufferer for 17 Years - feeling hopeless,"Up until about 17 years ago, I had never really experienced a ""headache"" of any form so I couldn't really appreciate how significantly it could impact someone's life. Since they started, my headaches, based on everything I've researched and been told, are in the 'tension type' category. However, although I do experience symptoms that would fall into that category, I often experience much, much more. I wake up EVERY morning with a headache and it continues all day, every day until I go to sleep (which takes a while because, you guessed it, I have a headache). In addition to the vice-like grip I feel on the sides and the back of my head all day, I also feel dizzy, irritable, sensitive to sound and light, and at times confused and searching for the proper words to use in my sentences. My short-term memeory is inconsistent at best which really scares me. When trying to hold eye contact during a conversation it hurts so bad I wnat to tear up. Further, I get these spasms that shoot up my neck and grab the back of my skull and cause it to twitch to the side (has anyone ever feltsomething like this?? scares me a lot), completely involuntarily. It almost feels like a tuning fork sensation travelling across the back of my head - happens several times a day! Put bluntly, it's torture and it seems to have no end. I have had 3 MRI's, CAT Scans, Blood tests, and tried every type of therapy and gimmick imaginable. All tests come back - ""normal"". The suffering I feel is anyhting BUT ""normal"". I've visited every type of doctor but nobody seems to be able to explain why it is I feel what I feel. They all have theories, but never answers. It is so frustrating. Tracing back to where it all began can be problematic as I was finishing a brief career in Junior hockey (during which I sustained at least 2 concussions that I know of) and starting to work a desk job which has me sitting in a very unhealthy position for most of the day. Is it concussion related or is it my neck jutting forward as I sit in front of a computer? I can't say for certian that it's either, or perhaps a combination of both. Apparently nobody can. I've had doctors tell me it's my posture, weak neck muscles, stress, depression, diet, not enough water....you name it. Problem is, I'm extremely active, eat well and drink a ton of water every day and furthermore, weak neck muscles shouldn't make me feel dizzy and confused (I don't believe so anyways). I'm amazed I`m abale to funtion to the level that i do, however i feel that pushing through the constant pain every day is taking its toll on me physically and mentally. Simpe tasks are feeling larger and larger. I'm at my wits end here. Hopeless doesn't even begin to describe how I feel when each morning arrives and another pressurized, spasming, tight-banded headache awaits me. I guess I'm writing on this forum with a faint hope that someone out there can offer some advice or perhaps even shed some light on their own similar experiences so that I can gain some insight on what may be causing this. Any ideas are welcome and sincerely appreciated. Thanks for reading this. "
Headache,Cluster Headache ,"I am writing this as at my wits end, my poor husband been suffering for a good 9 years with what has been identified as cluster headaches, he has a brain scan booked for tomorrow as I begged the Dr to please eliminate anything else. The latest episode has been over 17 weeks now and he looks and feels like he is dying, the pain is intolerable, he is doing all that he can to stop killing himself because of the pain, he in in misery every second of every day, he his either very very angry or in agony with the pain, I am terrified that he will overdose as nothing he takes works apart from the nasal spray but you only get so many of these prescribed and even they take a long time to work. He is now struggling to eat as it takes away his appetite. I just feel so helpless, my loving happy husband has disappeared and I just dont know what to do"
Headache,Chronic headaches ,"I have had headaches my whole life, but it seems that within the past year they have gotten worse. I would rate the pain in previous years as about a 4-5, and recently more like a 9-10. One day I had to stay home from work and even asked my husband to take me to the hospital. I have had doctors say I have tension headaches, sinus headaches, hormonal headaches, and even headaches related to the barometric pressure in the air...I have tried massage, chiropractor, muscle relaxers, and prescription pain meds of all sorts. I also have seen an ear, nose and throat doctor and got a CT scan which was completely normal. He told me to see a neurologist which I guess is my next step. He also told me that some people just get headaches and there's not much we can do about it. Has anyone else recieved this advice from a doctor? I was convinced I was having sinus heaches because it felt like a lot of pressure going on, but the CT scan was completely normal so now I am basically at square one. I also have low progesterone and read online that this can cause headaches, too. My gyno disagreed of course.Any advice or help anyone can provide would be SO appreciated. I have found that we need to be our own health advocates and not rely on doctors all the time. "
Headache,"i need some answers, cluster headaches","hello everyone.i just registered because i am trying to do some research. i am sorry if this is the completely wrong place to post this and if this is not allowed, but i feel i need some answers.four weeks ago i got an emergency appointment with my doctor because i had had a red eye for a week and i was very sensitive to light and looking at anything bright would send a shooting pain through my eye/head. moving my eye hurt, and i occasionally would get headaches on the right side of my head.the doctor was a question mark after he tested everything neurological and he sent me straight up to the emergency room where they admitted me, took more neurological tests, blood tests, urine/stool samples and eventually a CAT scan. that same night i needed to have a spinal tap and all these tests were completely fine.i stayed overnight and i got put on oxygen in the morning when i had an ""attack"", which did not help. then the pain just went away, and they diagnosed me with cluster headaches.i luckily had my friend with me and she commented on the fact that my eye had been constantly red throughout the week, when as i understand it, the redness should go away between attacks if it is in fact cluster headaches. i then got checked by an eye doctor and he looked at it and said that i had iridocyclitis.they then said there were some inconsistencies with my diagnoses, and said that there was a good chance i had both cluster headaches and iridocyclitis. i got sent home with eye drops and an eye cream that i was put on for three weeks. the pain disappeared the same night i started those, except for small pains in and around my eye occasionally. long story short - i got diagnosed with cluster headaches and then iridocyclitis and then the possibility of having both. pain went away. last night i had the same exact pain again, and my eye turned slightly red, just as before. i talked to my doctor who sent me to the eye doctor, who confirmed that there was no sign of the iridocyclitis anymore, and that i then most likely have cluster headaches.my questions are, as i understand it the pain is unbearable during an attack if it is in fact cluster headaches? i have looked around and tried finding stuff on the internet and it seems a million times worse than what i have. my eye/sometimes head just hurts when i look at light, and i occasionally get headaches but those are all over, and not localized to one side of the head. i also, like i said, was put on oxygen in the hospital but that had little to no effect on me. granted, cluster headaches can be ""mild"", but i would say the spinal tap i had was more painful than my ""attacks"". i should also say that i have no visual problems during these ""attacks"".i am just at a loss and do not know whether i have it or not. if anyone could shed just a little bit of light and share some experiences i would be so so so grateful!"

This is the only thing i am thinking these days.. The worst thing i did was google it.. and that really convinced me that i have Brain Tumour.. I still have a slightly stiff neck and i noticed that if turn my head on the right.. there is a shooting pain for a sec on one point of head. My qs is simple.. with all the people on the group.. Are the above symptoms of Brain Tumour.P.S: I have high BP for which i take medicine, have High Cholestrol for which i excercise..

Headache,"Tightness in head and black vision, any ideas?","This has been happening to me for a while and I've searched and searched, but nothing's come up. Every once in a while when I stand up, I'll get this tightness in my head, like someone is holding my brain in their hands and squeezing. I'll grab something to steady myself and then the pain will get more intense and vision will blacken, but I'll still be alert, hearing things and people around me, I can still move. Then, the pain will dissipate and my vision will come back. It only lasts a few seconds, a minute at the most. Any ideas?"
Headache,teenage son complaining of headaches,"my 14 year old son got a bad headache yesterday which he said came on very quickly. he then started to feel faint and nauseous. he has been in bed since, is feeling cold and has lost his appetite. he says the headache is constant and he feels like nothing tastes right hence his lack of appetite. could anyone suggest any causes or treatments for him. he is also still feeling nauseous and says that if he tries to stand up he feels faint immediately. I am trying to get him to eat something as I feel the dizziness is from not eating."
Headache,Head pain for 9 months. Help!,"Hello. I have been having headaches for going on 9 months, every single day. I have had multiple MRIs and CT scans of my head and neck, and all that has come back is that I have 3 degenerative discs in my neck. Additionally, my doctor found a bone spur in my neck on an x-ray. I do not have a diagnosis for my headaches but do have these things that have come back on tests. My headaches are generally pretty dull and travel all over my head. From the base of my skull, to the side, to the top of my head, front of my head and behind my eyes. The pain also shoots into my head and is alarming when it does. The shooting pain is not necessarily thunderclap pain, its more just piercing and can nearly cause me to jump when it happens. The pain somewhat burns and is very uncomfortable. My neck is almost constantly sore and seems to be very pressure- filled. Any time I move my head back or side to side, I hear a pop. These headaches are debilitating and have definitely decreased my enjoyment of life as I am scared something bad is going to happen to me and bring much fear and pain. I have tried a lot of different medicines from my neurologist: verapamil, topamax, amitryptiline, and lyrica to name a few. I have been to a great physical therapist for months with no relief. I have since stopped seeing her because the therapy does not help me. I have also been to a chiropractor, eye doctor, pain specialist (have had about 6 nerve blocks and trigger point therapy), been to dentist (got a mouthguard that I wear at night, no relief), I use a heating pad on my neck, tried dry needling, etc. I am going to an allergist later this week to see if I could be allergic to something. Anyway, I know this post is long but I really wanted to explain everything that is going on with me. I am waiting to get in to see a neck specialist at Johns Hopkins, am desperate for some relief. Among all of this, I am a 21 year old female, so obviously these symptoms are very strange. The doctors that I have seen so far say that there is no way that these degenerative discs could cause this type of head pain, and no one has really addressed the bone spur. As I stated, I am 21 years old and have also never really been sick in my life. If someone could please please provide some insight for what they think could be happening to me or give any helpful tips, I would really appreciate it. "

Headache,Bonespur ,"Hello. I have posted a few times on here before about my headaches that have been going on for 8 months now. I have had MRIs, CT scans, occipital nerve blocks, cervical epidural injection, been to PT, chiropractor, neurologist, tried different medications, had eye exam, and many more... No relief. My head pain seems to start in my neck and travel all over my head, behind my ears and eyes, primarily staying on the right side of my head, but also travels to my left side occasionally. I wake up with these headaches and they go pretty consistently all day. I go to sleep OK and sleep fine, and wake up with them all over again. I am now going to a back doctor/pain management specialist who seems to really want to help me. Today, he performed a facet injection in my lower neck. He told me that he could see a ""bone spur"" on my Xray. He told me not to get too excited that this is the cause of my headaches, but could definitely be contributing. He said that my facet injection could take 10 days to work and that the bone spur might be irritating my nerves, causing problems. Has anyone had a bone spur causing these types of headahces? If so, have you found anything that gives you some relief? Has anyone ever had a facet injection to relieve your headaches. Please let me know and give me any ideas to relieve my headaches! I have anxiety which is definietly making my headaches worse, but I know that my head pain is not soley from anxiety. No doctor seems to be able to pin things down with exactly what is wrong, and I am desperate to get better! Someone please let me know and give me some suggestions!Many thanks in advance. "
Headache,I've had headaches and dizziness for over a year what could it be?,"Late in 2014 I started getting headaches and dizzy spells but not together. The headaches would be on the front of my head, the top, or the back, and it was more a dull ache than an exrcuciating, unbearable pain. It wouldn't be in the same place either, but in different or varying places. It, or the dizzy spells would last for a few hours and then disappear on and off for days. I then could go two or three days symptom free. I went to Hospital on 23rd December 2014 thinking it could be something serious but I was told I was dehydrated. It carried on all the way through 2015. Dizzy spells, or headaches, but not together. There would be no predicting when it would happen or where, but usually I knew or could feel it coming on. I thought it was my Sinuses that were congested, as I have had this a few years ago, but on the 20th October I had a scan and they were clear. I had no symptoms until the 24th November then it started again. I have often, if I have had a dizzy spell, woke up after about two hours sleep and eventually gone back. I have woke up with it and then it has worn off in the day, It often has come on at night though I have noticed. I no longer get pain at the back of my head, and never at the side. When it starts, blue rings appear under my eyes and last until ends.I have never had double vision, been sick, collapsed, fainted or blacked out. I am functional with it and my cognitive abilities haven't been impaired. However, it is ruining the quality of my life and I would like to know if anybody has any idea what it is, and what is causing it.Thank you"

Headache,Worried Tension headaches everyday for a month ,"Hi, I've had headaches everyday from morning till the evening for around a month. They usually get worse during the day and I do think that I may be suffering from unresolved mental health issues. I do have a lot of anxiety at the moment from a bereavement that I havent coped well with. I went to the doctors because I got myself worked up and convinced i was dying. She said that it must be tension headaches because I dont have any other symptoms like nauseau/sickness/vision problems/ balance problems/ eye problems. I also explained that when I raise my eyebrows it hurts and she said its to do with the muscles. She gave me 10mg of amitriptyline to try but i am still worried. How can I have headaches everyday all of a sudden? Does anxiety cause that bad headaches? In other peoples experiences has amitriptyline helped? I can't stop thinking that something bad is going to happen ( i am well aware this is probably irrational but i cant stop worrying) "

Headache,Constant nagging headache for approx 3 months! What's wrong with me!,"Hello everyone,This is my first time here so bear with me. It all started very early september, I remember slowly gaining a headache while I was out running some errands. Nothing too bad that made me have to rush home. I went about the rest of my day until I slept. I woke up the next morning with the headache and it hasn't stopped since. I was at the ER about 4 times before I forced them to give me a ct scan as I was afraid of brain cancer. CT was negative, all blood work I recipeved was negative. I went to my primary care doctor who gave me fiorocet to no effect. He then referred me to my current neurologist but we seem to be at our wits end. The first session I received a cortisone shot in my neck as he thought it was occipital neuralgia. After it didn't work he prescribed nortiptylan which I am on now. I haven't noticed a difference. He says I don't need a mri as I have no neurological symptoms. However, my symptoms are basically head pain/head pressure in my forehead, temples, and back of neck. I also have noticed some days that shaking my head really aggrivates the pain and some dAys is so painful I can't even shake my head no. Other than that I don't really have any other symptoms. As of a few weeks ago I started to feel tingling in some of my fingers and feet, like they've fallen asleep, as well as a slight weakness in my arms and some mild fatigue. I have been out of work since this started and it's making me so depressed, things I once enjoyed are no longer enjoyable because all I can think about is what is wrong with me! I have it from the second I wake up to the second I go to sleep, and it never let's up fully. Is there anyone who shares my symptoms and can help?I've seen countless topics but the user never responds after a certain amount of time, making me think the worst. Help please! "
Headache,"Research into consistent, daily headaches","Hi guys,I've been following this site for a while now and it's crazy how my problems correlate with so many others, it's great not to be alone!I've been experiencing headaches every day for just over 10 months now, the severity of them changes; some days are unbareable and others I can get by. I've had an MRI scan, had massages, been going to the Chiropractor, acupuncture, accupressure, meditation, been to the doctors about 50 times etc.. I'm sure you guys know the drill.I'm 22, live quite a busy lifestyle working in a bar and as a musician gigging so I'm aware these things could contribute to my headaches but I really don't believe the cause is necessarily psychological (from anxiety, depression etc.)I'm on amytrip, as everyone else is, just been upped to 20mg. After around 3 weeks I felt amazing that my headaches were finally shifting, literally felt like a God send but now I feel like I've lost my tolerance to them or they just simply don't work anymore.Anyways, we've read enough situations similar to mine, we all know how frustrating it is that no one else can understand around us no matter how synmpathetic they are, how depressing and difficult it is socially and professionally to carry on. Trust me, I feel that pain.SOI've seen on a few posts that groups of people are working together to look towards identifying the cause and maybe a solution. I myself have been thinking strongly about this and I wanted to ask on this forum whether people would be up for completing surveys, maybe helping out with some research globally, looking at environmental factors, age, gender etc..These are the areas I would like to study to perhaps see if we an find a common factor, I'm no academic but I have a vague background in researching (college), and I feel like the medical system is never going to deem this issue large enough to actually address. Instead of handing out antidepressents for people (who most aren't even depressed in the first place, or are as a consequence of the headaches) they should be looking for root of the problem. Every doctors I've seen has been completely stumped, none of them know.It's interesting that many of us describe similar headaches in terms of severity and consistency, but some experience different symptoms. I have felt disorientation for the past year, pretty much every day. I get confused easily (its become a bit of a joke at work but I don't like to joke about it too much..) I can't sum up normal sentences off the tip of my tongue like I used to, its really bizarre as I was never like this. Let me know if anyone else has this issue.If anyone could provide any information they may have found so far, groups that are researching this, or any general information on case studies or any common connections they have noticed, I would be so grateful!We all need to stick together and find a solution!"
Headache,Occipital Neuralgia,"Does anyone have problems with occipital neuralgia? I have been having headaches everyday going on 7 months now that are dull and cause shooting head pain.

I have gone to PT for 4 months and had 2 nerve blocks. Nothing has given me relief. I went to a new doctor yesterday and he suggested that I may have occipital neuralgia. I am desperate to hear about what has helped other people and to hear about how eveyone else copes with this/if it has gotten better.Look forward to hearing back."

They started off quite mild, just a dull ache that lasted a few weeks then would go for a few weeks. The long I've had them the worse they've got. I've also got other symptoms:DizzinessNausea Swelling behind right earNeck stiffnessPins & needles in hands Numbness in right side of faceI've had 2 blood tests which came back clear.

Headache,Headaches,"Over the past year and a half, I have been struggling with headaches everyother day. I also have been having a racing heart, but not as often. Once a month or so. I've been to a PT, massage therapist, a headache specialist, and a chiropractor. My chiropractor thinks it is from stress, but when I am visibly stressed - I don't get a headache. I was thinking it was from something that I am eating, but I cannot find a common pattern in my food diaries. Maybe gluten or dairy? or is it really stress?? I did notice today that I had a monster migraine when I got to work. I was anticipating a very stressful day at work (it was fine though) and after I got home and had dinner - my headache was gone.? Thoughts?"

I'm am 18 year old female and I haven't been feeling well for the past 9 weeks, some days I feel better than others but I always have pain.

Headache,Head pain from neck/shoulders,"Hi all,I have been experiencing horrible head pain for the past 6 months. I've been to a neurologist and had multiple tests (MRI's/CT scans) performed and everything has come back normal. The only thing that has come up has been ""lordosis"" in my neck and ""slight changes in C5 and C6"" in my neck. My headaches started back in May when I was moving out of my apartment and seemed to have strained myself. I have been going to a PT and that has not helped. Additionally, I have had 2 nerve blocks, trigger point injections, and dry needling, none of which have helped. I am scheduled to get botox injections in my neck and lower head to hopefully help. Additionally, I am going to a neck/spine specialist. Both happening next week. Can anyone relate to the pain that I have been having? My pain seems to start in my neck and travel all over my head, on one side of head to the other, behind eyes, behind ears, etc. It feels like a stinging, uncomfortable pain. Someone please help, give suggestions, relate to me!! Feeling desperate and feeling like my head will never get better.Thanks."
Headache,I've had a chronic headache for over 5 years that is unresponsive to all treatments. Any advice?,"I'm a 53 year old male that has exhausted all known avenues in pursuit of relief from head pain following a fall, after a total loss of conciousness, resulting in a skull fracture and cerebral hemorrhage.The only ray of light is consesus by two neuro docs that it seems I might have CSF. However, as no evidence of such a diagnosis is indicated by tests or scans, they also are in consensus that justification for following protocol for locating the potential leak is difficult to provide.I would appreciate learning accounts from anyone who has or had a similar condition. I'm also open to any advice, guidance or inquiry."
Headache,"Please someone give me advice or just any feedback, I'd be very grateful?","I posted earlier but haven't gotten any doctors appointments (not that they would offer me help)..Again, this past year suddenly my health has just gone out of wack. The only things that really affecting my quality of life are the constant pain in my head, the quick detoriation of my eyesight and excessive hair loss.My eyesight worsened from perfect to needing glasses 24/7 within two months, the past three months I've had such horrific migraines - I couldn't walk or see, I couldn't lay down.. Far worse than any migraines I've had in the past. On top of that I seem to have a constant buzzing pain in my head that 9/10 turns into a headache every damn day.. My hair is falling out to the point where I can't move without it falling onto my top.. It looks straggly and it's a nuisance. I wear wigs because of how much hair I'm losing. I've not changed my hair care routine and I've always had strong and healthy hair..I've told my doctor about these symptoms - had a brain mri and blood tests. Blood tests were okay, no results from brain mri yet. I'm at a loss. I spend almost 10 hours every day lying in my bed because the tiniest thing can set off the buzzing pain into a headache.. I'm in pain almost all the time, I don't know what to do anymore. Nothing makes the pain go away."

We do not wake up with these headaches thou.We take different types of headache pills from different manufacterers.Only thing I could possibly think of is maybe the power lines that run by.They are about 100 meters away( about 330 feet)...All neighbors are not suffering from headaches and quite a few live closer to the lines ..It's spring time but both of us do not suffer from heyfever (excuse spelling)..other than that I'm stumped..I live in South africa hence my conversions, sorry if I got them wrong as I'm guessing.."
Headache,"Headaches, migraines, anxiety.... HELP!!","Hi, I write this as a last resort to find out what is wrong with me if anyone can help me and my smoky would be grateful. I am at my wits end, please be patient and bare with me, I babble! Oh and I am 25 years old. For years I have suffered, going back to what I can remember as the beginning was about 4 years ago. I remember feeling dizzy, sick, weak a lot with headaches. Left it a long while drs done blood tests to rule things out all was good. I began taking pain relief regularly although not massive amounts. My headaches got worse. After years of complaining to the drs they sent me for a scan on my head, only for me to find out I was pregnant on the day of the scan and I couldn't have it. By then my headaches had me in tears, is this normal, do I need to live like this? I was also having 2/3 migraines a month! A lovely gp had the pleasure of m breaking down, she said I was to go to a neurologist. I seen him whilst I was pregnant and he told me I was suffering from medication over use headaches AKA rebound headaches. He explained these are also closely related to caffeine too. I was unsure at the time but I cut everything out painkillers and caffeine and things improved. Throughout the rest of my pregnancy I thought things were great put the reY down to normal pregnancy stuff. My second child is now 7 months old, for the last 3 months thing have gotten worse. I don't drink caffeine drinks full stop altho I do have chocolate and I'm aware there is some in here and I avoid painkillers unless necessary. This time things are slightly different although this is how I remember things started 4 years ago, why I started taking pain killers in the first place. I feel sick, dizzy and weak and Ofcourse headaches. I try to do my research in types of headaches and sometimes I feel like I can relate to all of them. I get the tight band type feeling around forehead (tension headache??) I get terrible achey pain behind my eyes, my vison is just awful im so scared I'm just gona go blind, I have a slight astigmatism whoch I wear glasses for A's and when but they don't seem to ease my eyes as much as they used to, I'm thinking I need to go back, been 2 years in jan, is it possible for eye sight to alter in that time? I also get strange feeling/sensations in my head not so much painful but horrible, I get these in the back of my head, side of head, temples.And to top it off 6 weeks ago my migraines with aura returned out of the blue. As frequent as 3 within 8 days. The aura comes as blurred shapes in my vison, then I get the stra ge feeling in my head then pain starts in my eye along with nausea. Gp suggested propranolol 40mg I was skeptical as I tend to react badly of meds but thy seemed fine and after 3/4 weeks no migraines until today.Last week I was talking to gp about an article I read, this was the nice gp who seems very understanding. I was saying an article Id read about anxiety and I was shocked how much I could relate to alo t of symptoms, negative thoughts, over things and worrying about everything etc. I old her I worry so much about my head, I'm scared il have to leave my boys but I know it's nothing serious as the scan would have picked it up( oh I finally had a scan few months ago, all good she straight away agreed and suggested cognitive behVioural therapy. The more I think about anxiety it makes sense, however I don't think of my self as an anxious person but I do worry and over think every situation. I think it's just become normal to me. Now I'm questioning of this is the reason for my headaches? I also lately suffering back of head and neck a lot. It's really getting me down, that's acually an understatement, it's ruining my relationship, I'm cranky, snappy, on edge and moody and I don't want to me. I have two amazing little boys I want to get on the floor and play with but my head is always playing up. The only other thing I haven't mentioned is I always feel like some headaches are sinusey, hurt when I move feel stingy and tight? My go said any so us problems would have shown on scan. Sometimes I take an antihistamine which helps with those headaches. I am at my wits end, if anyone has any help or advice I would appreciate it. I NEED to get to the bottom of this I can't live like this I can feel myself getting lower and lower, I don't want to go down that route. ;("

Headache,Headache during jiujitsu,"I've been quite susceptible to headaches for a while. I can't go on rides at theme parks and even if I shake my head from side to side, this is enough to bring one on. Obviously I just don't do that though, so it's fine.I started jiujitsu lessons yesterday though and had issues. Firstly, a simple warm up exercise but alternating from side to side, brought on a huge headache and make me feel sickAs the lesson went on, it got worse and worse with every slight bump my head got. By the end, I had to sit in my car for 15 mins before driving home because moving my head made me feel like I was gonna puke. The headache was excruciating and I felt so sick.Can anyone suggest something that could cause this, or is my body prone to headaches and it's just one of those things? I'm really annoyed as it's the first time it will have stopped me doing something that I actually want to do. I know it's a waste of time going to my doctor as he'll just think of the most simple solution and tell me it's definitely that.Thanks in advance.

Headache,"Head(ache/pressure), tired, confusion","I've been having daily headaches for a while, sometimes just little ones and sometimes pretty bad. When I don't have a headache I often have a strange pressure on the right side of my head.Right now I feel a little shaky, very tired, my brain isn't working like it should. I often find I'm reading things multiple times or taking far too long to work out simple maths things. And frustrated, every little thing annoys me.I had put it down to stress or tiredness but I had a lovely day Sunday and woke up feeling like it yesterday and had a good 9 hours sleep last night and feel the same today.Going to the doctor tomorrow as I'm fed up of feeling like this.

Headache,Allodynia and Gabapentin ,"So I'll try to keep this brief but for two years I have been suffering with a burning pain on the top of my head that has been pretty much relentless. I have had an MR I and a CT scan which haven't showed anything. I have also had an MRI of my neck which showed that I have a disc bulge at C5 to C6 but again this is apparently isn't causing the pain.I eventually got referred to the headache clinic who told me this sounded like allodynia and recommended I start gabapentin. This was two months ago and I have worked my way up from 300 mg a day to 1800 mg a day. It has done absolutely nothing but since last week I have had a proper headache not just the burning that I cannot get rid of. I have had four days off work now because I just feel like I wouldn't be able to function. My consultant is away and the secretary recommended that I just go down to a lower dose of the gabapentin so I am now on 1200 mg but the headache is persisting. It varies between a burning pain and I squeezing pain and moves from the back, to the top and forehead. I went to see my GP who didn't really seem interested and gave me naproxen which hasn't done anything. First of all I would like to know if anyone has suffered with allodynia on their head and how they treated it secondly has anyone tried gabapentin and feels like I do and thirdly can anyone give me some advice because I am going crazy!!Thanks in advance!!

I am on Neurotin and propranolol for them. When they start, the back of my head gets a warm to hot sensation, feels like it's melting, them BOOM! pain.

Headache,pressure in head,"Have constantly had this pressure in my head all day, have took ibuprofen which has done nothing for it. Took myself back to bed and still woke up with it. It's all in the right side of my face and around my ear. It's making me feel slightly faint every now and then and all I want to do is close my eyes. I suffer with migraines including pressure migraine but I'm not sure if this is one of them? Any advice would be great."
Headache,Don't feel i'm on the right meds,"Hi thereBit of background.I'm a 42 yr old female. I have suffered with headaches for a long time. I would say i get what i would class as a migraine once every 2-3 months so around 6 a yr. I don't get light or sound sensitive, i tend to just have a severe headache with a crushing feeling that NOTHING will help. On occasions i get migraine auras but with no pain. I get tunnel vision and can lose sight completely (feel like i have milk bottle bottoms in front of my eyes so can see light and movement but not actual things if that makes sense). I've taken Ibuprofen for this on many occasions which seems to get rid of it although my doctor says Ibuprofen wouldn't help and it's coincidental.I get headaches for around 7 days just around the time of my period, what i would class as cluster headaches. With these i take Sumotriptan which usually work. Doctor said if i got a sever headache i could take 2 but when i have a severe headache Sumotriptan do not work and taking 2 just make me vomit anyway.I take 80mg of Propranolol twice a day and also 1-2 Amitryptaline at night time. However i don't feel any of this medication is helping me and i don't really want to be taking it. I think my headaches are hormone related.I also suffer with terrible PMS.I've been looking into the benefits of Magnesium and wondering if taking a supplement may also help.Would be happy to take peoples opinions.Many thanks "
Headache,Answer to Head Pressure,"I know a lot of people suffer from the dreaded 'Head Pressure'. I've read many stories on this and other sites and there is often no answer to the very similar symptoms of Pressure feeling from behind the bridge of nose or forhead region, headaches and light headidness because of this. Often people say they wake up and it isn't really there but once they start to move around the pressure starts and builds up throughout the day. Some people say by chewwing, swollowing, popping ears helps reduce the pressure.ANSWER: Ear Grommets. These are small insertions put into the ear drum usually if people have ear problems e.g. infections or ETD. What essentially in a lot of people who post on here, is for some reason to much air is being let into the cavities within the nose / head. By using a grommet to open an airway to the outside may reduce the pressure feeling. EXAMPLE if you pop your ears, your Eustichian Tube opens and air rushes from your nose to your ears, this can help to equalise pressure within the ear as if on a plane.EVIDENCE 6 weeks ago whilst popping my ears using the Vaslava manouver I made a tiny perforation of my left ear drum, air then rushed out for 20-25 seconds. After this I was symptom free, no pressure, no headache, no dizziness. It was the best feeling ever, I felt normal again and had the best day. Sadly over the next day or so the pressure just built back up again.So there you have it, there is some hope that we could get a solution. I've spoken to the specialist about putting in a grommet but he is reluctant as he says there's no medical evidence.If you are reading this and think these symptoms are very similar to yours then please reply. Together we can beat this and go back to living our lives again."
Headache,Anyone else had enough of headaches,"Hi joined this site today as I dont know who to talk to. I am a male and 65 years old. 6 years I have had clusters and am just about at the end of my tether. My clusters last for 2 months and in that time I get about 130 Cluster Headaches, attacks ranging from from 1 - 5 a day mostly at night. I have Oxygen thank god which stops the cluster headache from getting to the bad place, you will know what I mean and it normally only takes about 10 minutes. They then go away for 8 months leaving me with severe headaches every day, in the night or when I wake up in the morning or even if I take a nap in the afternoon. So the cycle is 2 months clusters then 8 months headaches and then it all repeatsand off we go again. Does anyone else get this sort of pain."
Headache,Headache that will not go away anyone with the same problem. ,It's like a tension some tightness feeling in my head... once in awhile I have to crack my jaw and my eyes strain sometimes. Headache is not full pain it's just a pressure and dull ache. The dull ache feeling is usually midday and now for the 9th day in a row... I am becoming more frustrated now.
Headache,Strange Head Pressure,"Just wondering if anyone has had anything similiar to this.When asleep, I get this strange head pressure feeling. It's quite hard to explain it really. It feels like a weakening sensation. That's probably the best way to explain it. it's in one part and I suppose it's kind of like when you've had a dead leg or arm feeling but in my head. It's gone now I've got up but it happens from time to time but only when I'm asleep. It wakes me up but I roll over and go back to sleep, or it doesn't wake me up bur when I do in the morning I'm aware it happened or can remember it sort of like a dream."

Headache,I've had a little lump on back of my head for about 3 months. What should I do?,"I'm a 19 year old guy. I've had some kind of a lump on top left side of the back of my head for about 3 months. It is about a size and shape of a bean or something. When I touch it, I sometimes don't feel anything, but sometimes it feels numb, itchy or even burns. A few times when it got irritated my whole left side of head hurted (not so much, but it did). Sometimes also my right side of head is a bit tender to touch. I also felt some pain behind my eye. I went to my doctor and she said it might be a pinched nerve or something, but she said she doesn't know what could it be. I've had some pressing matters with school so I didn't have time to go to a neurologist. I am planning to go to neurologist next week, but I am very scared. I've read about temporal arteritis and occipital neuralgia, and some other scary diseases, can someone tell me what could this be, please?P.S I didn't know which group to select, so |'ve selected headache."
Headache,Constant Head Pressure out of the blue! ~,"Hi, I am 35 and my head pressure began just over 2 and half months ago. 1 dr diagnosed me with a sinus infection and put me on a antibiotic, which I had a bad reaction to.. However, I ended up in ER a few a days later as the head pressure just became unbearable. They did a CT, came back normal. The ER dr said I didn't have a sinus infection at all as I had no symptoms of it, just head pressure so he diagnosed me with cluster headaches and prescribed Butal (basically tylenol and caffeine) to help with the headaches. It did help keep them at bay for a while but I still wanted to get to the source. I went to a Chiropractor who showed me on Xray that my C1 and C2 vertebrae are out of alignment and that this may be the cause of my head pressure. I went a few times for an adjustment but didn't feel that it was resolving my issue. I went to a Nuero dr who ordered an MRI which came back normal. We took it a step further and I had a Lumbar Puncture (spinal tap) and blood work done today at the hospital to check for possible spinal fluid leak, lupus, MS, infection, inflammation, etc.. If no answers from these tests, then it's back to the drawing board I guess. I have always been very healthy, active and recently began a mostly all organic diet. Just not sure what could have caused this head pressure. The last apartment I rented had mold/mildew issues I feel. It was a nice place right on the water and would have never thought it had issues but I could smell it on my clothes after a few months when I traveled. Although we couldn't see evidence of it, they did 2 ozone treatments over the course of 2 or 3 months. The building went under renovation 4 months after i moved in, my head pressure began 2 months after that.. After the smell came back after the 3rd time, they ended up letting me out of my lease. I was there a total of 8 months. Maybe this could be the cause of it in my case, we'll see. I will keep you posted. Thanks."
Headache,Headaches for almost 3 years! Any ideas?,"Hey! I'm Victoria and I am 17.I have been getting chronic headaches since December 2012, it all started from a bang to the head.I have been to the doctors numerous times, only to be given different diagnoses and tablets, such as Sinus problems, which I had antibiotics for, tension headaches, cluster headaches, ect...I have had 2 MRI's, luckily both are clear.I have had blood tests for Thyroid, Anemia, and Diabetes.I have been given so many tablets, but I always have side effects such as getting really hyper, or not being able to sleep.Here are the tablets I've been given in almost 3 years:- Pizotifen x4- Amatriptalyn x2- Lansoprazole x1 - I also had chest pains, which still come and go, but I've had an ECG for that and all is fine. - Propanalol x1- Sumatriptan x3- Topamax - Started at 25mg, never went any higher....On the 21st of May I went to the Neurologist, and he gave me the Topamax, starting on 25mg, and he wanted me to increase it to 50mg 2 weeks after, until I get to 200mg a day.I started getting more depressed ( I suffer from depression anyway, but it was just making it worse ) And I was way too tired to do anything.2nd of June I went to walk out the bathroom, and my vision went all blury and I fainted, I'm not sure if it was the tablets or not, but my mum made me stop taking them.Apart from them tablets, I am a really tired person anyway. No matter how many hours sleep I get, I am ALWAYS tired, I always need to have a nap during the day, and even then I still wake up tired.This has been happening since September 2014.My arms also ache a lot, and sometimes my stomach has sharp pains, as well as the top of my arm.I also get tingly hands and feet too.I'm not sure what is happening, but I just don't feel right anymore, I am always getting told by the doctors to take certain tablets, I never get a proper diagnoses that actually helps me.I take Magnesium and B2 everyday, but nothing seems to work.I usually get 2 migrains, if not 3 a week, but the headache is always there, from the minute I wake up to the minute I go to sleep, and the amount of college I have missed because of it is terrible.2 weeks ago I went to the doctor as I had a tonsile infection, and I had antibiotics for a week, and it cleared up... But It is really hard to swollow food, as if they have closed up, and I went to the doctors about it today (24th June), and they told me there is nothing wrong, but to have a Glucose levels and FBC blood test. So hopefully that will tell them something.I'm just so sick of going back and forth to the doctors, getting different answers each time. I don't know if there is something up, but I just need help or anything.Thank you-Victoria "
Headache,Can anyone give me any advice?,"Hi My name is Mick and Im 43 years old, about 8 years ago I started my first bout of cluster headaches, at the time I was on holiday and thought I had a serious brain condition, I was fotunate enough that they only lasted for 2 weeks and had gone by the time I arrived back in the UK so didnt go to the doctors and just put it down to the heat. Two years later they returned and lasted about 3 weeks and have done every two years since.Last night I had my first cluster, straight away I knew what it was and had been expecting them to reappear as its my two year anniversary for suffering.Four years ago I was offered an ""alternative therapy"" when they started and this did absolutely nothing to help and then was prescribed Imigran 20mg Nasal spray which relieves the severe pain after about 15 mins from commencement of a cluster, then two years ago the same.So I went to my doctors this morning as I know the next bout has started to firstly be asked well how do I know its a cluster headache (every sufferer reading this will know what I mean when you say you know EXACTLY that it is a cluster) then got asked if I wanted to try the alternative therapy again to which I replied no, I just want the Imigran because although it doesnt prevent the headaches, it certainly helps making the pain more manageable, to be told that this is expensive? after a bit of begging I managed to get 12 doses prescribed but told that if Im still suffering after they have run out then I will have to try the alternative therapy instead as its cheaper.Im so p*ssed off, I am so worried thast my Imigran is going to run out and I know I cant handle these headaches without this, I used to literally headbutt the floor before I found this drug.Does anyone know if I can buy this legit over the counter in the UK or online?Also is anyone else having the same problems getting it prescribed?I know this is a bit of a long winded post but Im so worried Im going to run out of Imigran before my latest bout finishes."
Headache,Severe headache and sickness for over 3 weeks,"Hi all,Ive been suffering with what I thought were migraines for about 3 years. I would get them once or twice a month for 3/4 days and although I would have a day when it was very severe it was for the most part bearable with painkillers.Last december I had heart surgery for a thoracic aortic aneurysm and replacement valve. Since the operation the headaches have gradually got worse, especially on bending down or coughing. 3 weeks ago my doctor sent me to A&E because my appoinment with a neurologist wasn't until 27th July and she felt I needed treatment sooner. I had a CT scan without contrast which came back normal (I was very relieved). My blood pressure is fine. I was able to see a Consultant neurologist who is of the opinion that it is migraine or intracranial hypertension. I can't have an MRI because I have a mechanical heart valve so he is ordering a CT scan with contrast for me which he says will show any pressure. 3 Weeks later still waiting for scan appointment to come through. My headache hasn't gone, I have to spend most of every day lying flat on my back. I've also been told to stop taking co-codomol as it causes rebound headaches and also to only take paracetamol 11 days out of the month. So I'm a mess, in pain and unable to carry on with my active life. Also now I cant lift anything without a pain in the top of my head like I've been stabbed and the pain on bending down is enough to make me shed a tear. Has anyone else had this, I feel it must be something bad to cause such pain. I also have terrible nausea with it. Please send me some hope, I am feeling so down about it all,Gailx"
Headache,Please..please help me..,"About a month ago I started developing tension headaches that only really happened more on the left side of my head rather than on both sides and really bad neck pain that is more on the left side. I went to the ER and to my primary doctor because I was 100 % sure I had a brain tumor and they asked if I had any other symptoms apart from the headaches and they also did a neurological test where they test my reflexes and check if I can follow their fingers with my eyes and not move my head and they said that it was simply just tension headaches, that I was fine.I had a tension headache for a month and then it went away for about three weeks, I was pain free and happy!! A couple of days ago they came back -_- and its about the same kind of dull pain but this time it goes over my eyebrow and my eye a little and it feels like my eye is cold. Now me being a hypochondriac I now assume I still have a brain tumor my psychologist and everyone else that I talk to this about say that they don't think that if I had a brain tumor or an aneurysm it would leave me be for three weeks and not give me pain whatsoever and then randomly come back, unfortunately I don't seem to get this through my head that I'm perfectly fine and I wanted to know your opinionsBy the way I have recently been diagnosed by my psychologist with severe clinical depression, severe generalized anxiety disorder with panic."

Headache,"Please, i'm really getting scared.",So about seven days ago I started to get a heache and nausea and I had to go home from work. Since then I have had pressure in my head and occasionally headaches and feel dizzy and nausea when standing. I have been to the doctor and they say it is a virus but I am not sure. I have never had anything like this. At the moment I am really scared that it will not go away. Has anyone else had a virus like this?

Headache,I'm 15 experiencing TERRIBLE brain fog ...,"Hi I'm 15 and have been experiencing brain fog for the last two weeks.During the past year I stupidely got in to a sort of ""party life"" using a LOT of MDMA(monthly use), smoking Cannabis(weekly use) and also drinking.The last time I took MDMA was about 4-5 weeks ago but in a very small quantity and about 2-3 weeks before that, but in a much bigger quantity.I last smoked Cannabis very stupidely last week-end(a lot) , assuming that the ""brain fog"" was just because of a hangover or something, I used to smoke Cannabis regularly (once a week on weekends, and sometimes during the week, and almost everyday during holidays) but have now quit due to the brain fog.I tried magic mushrooms 3 times.I drink on nights out with friends and tend to drink a lot.I also smoked Salvia once about 2 weeks ago before the ""brain fog"".And now for the last two weeks I constantly feel weird, I cannot concentrate, I constatly feel sort of ""buzzed out"" but in a bad way, when ever I do try to concentrate my brain sort of heats up and I get a headache and it gets much much worse, at sometimes I feel as though it is fading away and coming to an end but, then it just comes back as usual also I sometimes feel a sort of liquid going through my head and to the back of my eyes that feels like if it were bleeding and forgetfullness like I've never had before. What I find strange is that in recent weeks I have not done MDMA (which in Oct-Jan I used a LOT and barely affected in anyway me and managed to get good marks at school one of the reasons why I stupidely continued) but still have smoked Cannabis a bit more than usual but still I felt normal up until two weeks ago which during which I drank, smoked Cannabis and Salvia which is nothing compared to what I would usually do, so I find it strange that this only started two weeks ago sort of ""out of the blue"" .I'm very very worried about this and will take all the information and advice you can give ? thank you "
Headache,Headache for days now,Hi I'm 23 year old female and recently out of no where I began feeling this pressure on the side of my head both sides right above my ears. Then on Saturday the pain was so strong I even cried and threw up. I'm drinking Advil but the medicine isn't even relieving my pain. I've never experienced this and I'm getting very worried since the medicine is not helping me. Does anyone have a clue what it can be? I've never really suffered from headaches

Headache,"fell down after having starry vision, headache ect. -- is there anything of concern?","All day today I have felt not so good having a headache it would sometimes go away and come back occasionally). Tonight I felt really tired as I sat down to do work and couldnt think straight because the headache had gotten bigger and my vision had become cloudy and starry at times. My stomach started to feel uncomfortable and as I stood up, I became really dizzy. I walked to my room and just fell while I was walking to my drawer. I think I blacked out for a little bit, but not a long time maybe just a second, but I am not sure. I fell on my wrist and me head, both of which hurt a lot now. Should this be of consern to me? The sensationsof abnormal visions and headache occur often but never to the point of falling."
Headache,Constant head pressure / headache for 2 weeks,"Hello, for the past two weeks i've had a constant pressure kind of feeling in my head that does not ever go away. I don't really know how to describe it but it is like a tightness inside my head, under the top of my head and sometimes also behind by eyes. It has got progressively worse and it is horrible in the mornings. On top of this I have started to see more floaters and my vision has changed. I saw an experienced doctor recently and he told me it was stress related because I have my final a level exams coming up (I am 18 soon). I'm also stressing about whether it actually is stress. I had had on and off random head pains for about four weeks prior to this anyway.I have been to see many doctors over the past two months anyway because of other problems including abdominal pain, a change of bowel habits, sharp upper abdominal pain that occurs pretty much every day and always feeling bloated. The pain is near the bottom of my rib cage. I also feel a bit sick sometimes and back pain has become a recurring thing as-well. I had an ECG a month ago and that came back normal.I feel like I have gotten progressively worse during the run up to my exams and I am also a massive hyperchondriac and I can't stop worrying about this head problem or my general well-being. It's been the only thing on my mind and I can't tell if it's just me or there really is something wrong.Doctors told me a while ago it was probably IBS (the synptoms I had before the head pressure started) and they did a test to check it was not IBD after I sent in a stool sample. They said that was fine but since then I have started to see red things in my stool and i'm convinced this is blood, it isn't there every day though. This was all before the head pressure thing developed.I find it hard to concentrate now and this is stressing me out even more because I can't revise properly. Can it really be worrying and stress? I feel like my mental capabilities have dropped a bit, but maybe i have just convinced myself that as-well as thinking there are more floaters when there actually are not. I have been stressing about everything long before this started anyway but i've never read anything about a stress related head problem not going away.Can anyone help? My apologies because this sounds very specific and I don't know what else to do, I haven't felt myself for 2 months."

Headache,weird tingling headache on one side,Hi! So for a while I've been getting these weird headaches; typically on the right side of my head. It usually shifts from the back to the temple; it can be described as a slightly tingly feeling. My doctor says they're due to anxiety and tension. Is anyone else getting the same?
Headache,Pain whenever I lay down on my back,"I need help. I can't be the only one with this condition. My pain is mostly in the left side of my face, my left shoulder and my left arm. It is a very dull stabbing/aching pain. The trigger for my pain is when I lay down on my back. I feel pain when I first lay down. I awake in the morning feeling like I need a root canal on the left upper side. I have extracted three permanent molars trying to relieve the pain. This is not a joke! Please help!"
Headache,Constant headaches....health anxiety as well,"Hello, lets start by saying I've had about 10 blood tests last year that all came back normal. I have headaches that like to bother me and not go away for weeks at end. I also have this weird pressure..almost like a pinched nerve feeling around my right eye. I've had a CT scan done with no dye and a few doctors including a neurologist doing the flash light test, looking into my eyes, and the whole testing my strength and balance. I want to know would a CT scan show any aneurysms? They did the CT to check for any sinus issues. I am planning on going back to the urgent care (ct was done about a year ago) and see if they will investigate further and ask them their thoughts on the matter. I'm sure they would have the CT on record. "
Headache,I've had a headache for about 13 months?,"I've have a constant and I mean constant dull headache, everyday, every minute, every second. I don't get a rest from it at all and i've been suffering for over a year now.I've been on Amitripilyn, Fluxocilin, Amoxcilin, Gabapentin and now i'm currently on Co-Amoxicla (sorry if they are misspelt).I have also been taking 30mg / 500mg of co-codomol / solpadol and I've probably taken around 300 of these over the past 6 - 12 months. My doctor ruled out cluster headaches as my headaches are different from those in regards to where they originate.Yes I understand what co-codomol is and I understand the risks however I am now to the point where ending my life is becoming increasingly tempting and I really don't want to do that.Then recently i've developed a really bad chest infection and a blocked nose which has been present for about 9 weeks now. Anyway I then went to another doctor and they noticed I had a polip in my nose so they have reffered me with ENT specialist however I'm not 100% confident that this is what is causing my constant headaches.I always feel them coming from my shoulders / neck and up the back of my head and it kind of just sits ontop of my head aching constantly.. It's also worth mentioning that if I jolt my head forward fairly quickly, I get the pain shoot into my head which is completely immobilising.Does anyone have any similar issues they have received a diagnosis for? I'm just out of ideas now and as I say I really don't believe that the ENT specialist will be able to help me as it feels like a nerve / muscle issue.Thanks! "
Headache,headache and amiltriptiine,"Hi.You may have read my earlier posts about my circumstances and i'm bored with it too but after 40 years of constant headaches and steadily get worse i have got to sort it out as thr thought of another 20 or 30 years of this pain is not very appealing.I started over with a visit to my GP who refered me to a neuroligist who as usual said nothing to worry about. My GP said the usual tension headache stuff and suggested another go at Amiltriptine, so here i am on 20 mg at night unable to wake until 10 and carry around a lethergy all day. Has anybody else experiened the same thing? and of course my headaches are no better. I am hopeing that a medical proffessional reads my posts and is interested enough to get in touch.My symptoms... not a part of my head that has'nt ached or hurt, sometimes pressure in my left ear, sometimes visual disturbances ( eyes are ok), sometimes a metal taste in my mouth, sometimes shivvery cold feelings, sometimes sore neck that creeks when i move it and a very sore scalp that hurts to touch and even when brushing my hair.sorry to go on but getting desperate again. I do hope somebody reads this and can help me.Thankyou for reading this and no i'm not making it up as i suspect all of the Doctors i've seen think."
Headache,Pressure in Head,"Hello, I have had a very heavy pressure & awful pain in the back of my head for over 7 days. I normally take slow release oxycodone (morpheine) & amitriptyline, Naproxen & omeprazole for another condition I have. However I have never experienced pressure in my head like tis before, the pain was so bad for over 7 days I went to the doctor, he thought I may have a bleed, so off to A & E where I was given a ct scan, that showed nothing. Kept in hospital that evening and the next day a lumber pncture was performed, this in itself can give you a pressure headache, at this point I could not lift my head off the pillow. I have spent 4 days in hopsital and nothing has showed up although the culture test was not back at the time of me leaving. I am still in the same way, although all of the pain now covers the back and top of my head. In between morpheine I take & naproxen, paracetomol was also given as well as coedeine and Sumatriptan which made no difference. I am home now and still have this awful pressure with no answers.Strange thing is, the doctors look at you as if you are making it up, and you just want a test to come back positive just to prove the problem you have is real. I know other people have also listed this pressure in the head, there must be something to link eople whi are having this problem, what it is, is a mystery really, to me anyway. "

Headache,Friend experiencing serious headache problems. Seeking advice.,"Hi,I have a 29 year old friend who is having, what seems like to me, a very serious headache problem. I am wondering if it is advised for him to go and see a doctor. He has always seemed to have a headache problem his whole life on and off and has had strokes when he was a child, but refuses to go to the doctors because that is just the way he is. I am a bit concerned because these seem like they are worse than the last time he was having problems with headaches. He has tried to eat more regular meals and drink lots of water. Is there anything else that could be tried in the case that this could just be mild headache problem and anything really serious could be ruled out?Thank you any information or advice you may have! "

Headache,Cluster Headaches,"My Name is Eleni I am 30 years old and have been suffering from Cluster Headaches now for approximately 7 years however have only been correctly diagnosed for the last 3 years, which by the way was NOT by my doctor it was by my husband and sister who would sit on the computer day and night researching on the internet to try and find out what this pain was that I was going through as it was 100% NOT a migraine like my doctor constantly diagnosed me as having for years and years.When eventually my doctor finally listened to me once I demanded to be referred to a neurologist that is when I was finally diagnosed correctly that I suffer with Cluster Headaches... Finally will I now get these evil headaches under control???When reading through all of your messages I am saddened and can relate and sympathise to all of your pain that each person is experiencing.The pain I experience....It is always my right hand side of my neck, head, eye and jaw/ teeth. This pain feels like someone is pulling and stabbing my eye out of its socket without any pain relief along with someone yanking all of my teeth out one by one...before I even get a chance to prepare for this pain once again BANG the pain it in its full peak without any warning. I could not tell you if my eyes water as many people say this is one of their symptoms however this is only due to the fact that when I have a cluster I cry and scream like an absolutely baby just wanting to die just so that the pain will stop... after rocking myself back and forth and taking my injection the pain eventually STOPS suddenly just as sudden as it begun. I have noticed a pattern that my clusters seems to follow..Every 18 months I wake up approximately 2 hours into my sleep with a cluster headache and that's me for the next 4 weeks. I have read that people say there clusters are worse at night and I have to agree that this is mostly the case for me as well. Whether its a case of the fact that for days on end I have not slept and that these cluster headaches have completely wiped out very ounce of energy I had I don't know but to say the pain is excruciating is an understatement. I am a married women who luckily enough I have the most amazing husband ever who is there for me throughout each and every one of my clusters helping me to understand that it will only be 20-45 minutes of this pain and I will feel better soon but for the people who go through this all on their own I can only but sympathise with them.I have found that a few things I do seem to help slightly ease the pain following each and every time I get a cluster...Make sure that you either go outside or open all your windows for as much air as possible and take as deeper breath as possible through your mouth and then exhale through your nose. I have been told this helps by getting as much oxygen to the brain as possible which is why some people use oxygen tanks. I usually stand up which I find is better than sitting down.Water is a must for me, I drink as much as my body can take without feeling sick. Make sure it is not ice cold which can be just tap water or room temperature. This seem to dilute the length of my clusters ( be aware though that you can actually drink too much water for your body as well though )Do not take hot baths at all. I found that heat only but intensifies the pain for me even crowded roomsDo not use any deodorant, perfumes/ aftershaves, sprays or anything with oil based. Avoid strong smells even things like petrol. I would advise not to drink alcohol as this can bring on clusters and intensify a clustermaybe try using a cold flannel on your forehead Try making a very very strong black coffee no sugar and drink as quickly as you can ( please be aware that for some people this can make a cluster worse but for me it seems to helps )I make sure that I do not use any products on me like muscular pain relief gels in particular Menthol fragrance gels due to the smell as I mentioned above.I avoid chocolate, cheese and any other items that generally cause headachesI think the one thing that is the most upsetting is that for years and years NO ONE apart from my family would or could sympathise with the pain I go through every time I am in a cluster cycle. unless they experience seeing me when I get one in front of them. People at work would try to understand by saying “That's awful, I know when I get a headache I have to go to bed and lay down and try and get some sleep” but as we all know this is not like a normal headache this is by far the worst pain any human being could go through and so when people hear the word cluster headache they just assume its like the same thing and it cant be as bad as you make out. I am lucky that I actually had a very understanding work place and they sent me home and told me to come back when I felt better but I am sure that for most people this is not the case and I just wish that this was taken much more seriously once and for all by doctors who seem to incorrectly diagnose people all the time with migraines!!!Just in case this helps the medication I am prescribed during a cycle of my cluster headaches are( Obviously I can not say which medication will suit each person but this seems to have helped me )x3 tablets a day of Verapamil 80g which is a calcium channel blocker which is meant to prevent a cluster from coming on or at least limit the number of attacks I suffer from ( I take this when I am in a Cluster and carry on taking this until 1 week after my 4 week period which I usually have my clusters for )Sumatriptan / Imigran Injections 6mg which is what I take at the acute of an attack. The only problem is I am only allowed to take 2 of these in 24 Hours so I have to use my judgement on which cluster I feel I can handle without medication or if I need to take the injection. Once I have taken this injection which I would suggest in your arm my cluster would go within minutes. I must say that all medication is so so expensive especially when you are off work trying to deal with this horror situation.I really hope that, even if one of my part of my advise above helps just one person then I would feel truly grateful.Good Luck ( please remember I am not a doctor and can only go by what helps me this might not help everyone )"
Headache,My experience of headaches,"I started with tension type headaches about three years ago and took OTC painkillers which did nothing much at all, even co-codamol, however, I became hooked on the co-codamol and persuaded my gp to give me the 30/500 co-codamol. Initailly it cured the headaches but then they came back and I gradually increased my dosage until I came to a crisis in November 2014 when I overdosed on the co-codamol for sevarl days as the hedaaches were so bad. Pluckwed up courage and rang my gp who sent me straight to a&e who put me on the pracetamol antidote . I spent two days there with just ibuoprofen ansd a real bad head along with vomiting and rashes and breathing difficullties. When I got home I got rid of all my co-codamol and went cold turkey - it was absolutely aweful but in the end I got clean of the painkillers and and after about four weeks all the withdrawal symptoms had gone, along with the headaches. Obviously, my original headaches had morphed into rebound (painkiller) headaches and having got off the co-co I felt so much better, now I hardly ever get, headaches at all - unless its a hnagover lol!Just wanted to share my storyxxx"

Headache,alternatives,"Hi. Has anyone had success with any alternative treatments ie osteopathy, chiropractic, accupunture etc. I tried many years ago to no avail but am thinking of trying again as no help from doctors. The last treatment i sought was from a physiotherapist who assured me she was an expert on headaches so i gave it a go, over 2 sessions she attached a tens machine to my neck and left the room for 10 minites each time and charged me £130 and of course no relief. Any suggestions please?"
Headache,Medication-induced headaches? ,I am a 42 years'old woman with MS and congenital toxoplasmosis. I have been suffering headaches a great deal since my teenage years.. Long-term migraine treatments for a while and later on: paracetamol ad-hoc when in pain. 2 years go I started to have big / daily headaches ago. They came along with some burn-out problems at work and when my MS got worse suddenly. My neurolog prescribed some codein&ibuprofen painkillers. Which I have been taking almost daily since then.. Ending up in a vicious circle since I am now living with a helmet tight of headaches daily. I now have to reduce to ultimately stop my painkillers intake. By the end of March. I am almost a week done of a reducing the painkillers and It's hell!! So much pain.. And so tired! Anyone whom experienced that situation? When can I expect to see the end of tunnel? How long will it take? Do you have tips / recommendations of alternative treatment that could help during the coming months? A stupid question... Can I continue drinking coffee (forgot to check that with my doctors and I can't find info on that so far). Thanks for yr help!
Headache,head pain,"Hi. I've suffered head pain all of my life but now it is constant and ruling my life. I sleep and work. My main pains are either side of the top of my head like nails sticking in and the other is all over the top like being hit with a cricket bat. I have seen countless GP's including today when i was told to eat cheese and drink coke, i'm not joking. Over the years i have also been told to by a dog and go walking, turn the radio up and lay on a board.About every ten years i'm referred to a neurologist who after a few simple tests tell me i have'nt got a tumor. I've had numerous preventive meds, accupunture, homeopathy seen a choirpratic, osteopath and given up most things all to no avail. I have tried on numerous occassions to be referred to a headache specialist but none of them will.Anybody got any ideas?"
Headache,Constant head pressure / dizziness,"I've been suffering with constant head pressre and dizziness now for 2 months following a bad chest viral infection, although the dizziness had started quite a long before (but only for very short periods a couple of times a day). My doctor has no idea what it is and so far I have been prescibed medications covering vertigo, tension headache and migraine and nothing has worked. I am currenly on 20mg of amitriptyline which unfortunately hasnt helped either. This week the pressure has just got worse now accompanied by pain, made worse when I talk for some reason. I never take time off work but as I work on a computer all day I cannot cope with looking at a screen for long periods so cannot return. It has truly affected my life in every way. I have always been fit and active (I am 54) and love walking, acting and playing with my grand-children etc but not able to do any of these things at the moment which is awful.If anyone can help I would be so grateful.Thank you"
Headache,My head has been hurting for weeks and I don't know why,"Basically I've been getting headaches all my life put they've recently got progressively worst. I went to the GP and they took me for a blood test (came back as Vitamin D deficiency which I am now on medication for), but apart from that came back as fine. The GP then told me to go to the opticians and make a headache diary. I get approximately 5 to 10 headaches a day, plus lightheadedness and dizziness sometimes and fatigue and also to top it off strange creeping, tingling and numb sensations at the back of my head. The opticians said my eye prescription should change slightly but it would not be the sole cause for that level of headaches. My headaches vary from all around my head, and the creeping/tingling/numb feeling is getting progressively more and more and at one point spread to my back.Please help me figure out what it is because it's disrupting my work life "
Headache,Non-medication techniques for headaches,We would all like to use non-medication to treat our headaches. Two that I am trying at the moment are as follows:Stop eating all sugary stuff (like boiled sweets and cakes which I binge on once a week when I visit my mum).Wearing a beannie hat when I go to sleep at night. I started yesterday and I seem to be ok at the moment....fingers crossed it stays that way!Anyone have any other suggestions? If anyone says JUMP....please say how high! LOL
Headache,Light headache for 6 months. Please help.,"Hi everyone,Thanks for listening. 6 months ago it started. I started to have a light headache in the forehead, above the eyes. Mostly on the left side, but at certain moments it is (also) on the right side. A couple of days later I also developed post-nasal drip. This is the feeling of 'slime' dripping down your throat. I still have this everytime I swallow, but the amount differs a lot from day to day. Also, I still have the headache albeit pretty mildly. Mostly it is on the left side above my eye, but sometimes it moves towards the middle or right side...At first I didn't think much of it and I went to the doctor after a day or 10. He told me it is a slight inflammation of the sinus and gave me a cortison nasal spray and anti-histamine pills because most likely it was brought on by allergies.After using the spray for a couple of days, I started to have way more post-nasal drip so I thought it was working. Finally all this slime was 'coming loose' and was being transported out of my sinusses. The headache decreased a bit as well.Unfortunately, it never passed completely. We are now 6 months further and the symptoms still persist. Sometimes I have a week with almost no headaches, and then a week with more severe headache (although it never becomes really severe).In the meanwhile I have been to the doctor 6 times. I have used many different nasal sprays and have even used a 10-day course of anti-biotics.A couple of times I have stopped using anything whatsoever and after a week or 2 started a nasal spray again. Everytime this resulted in more severe post-nasal drip for a day or 2 so it seems to something at least. Unfortunately, it never passes completely.I am also taking vitamins, garlic/fishoil supplements, camiomille tea everyday, have tried steambaths, used saline nosesprays, etc. I have no idea anymore what's going on. Luckily the headache is not severe and I can live with the slight post-nasal drip, but things are just not going away. I've asked the doctor (several different ones) if it also can be a sign of anything more serious. All of them still stick to the diagnosis '(chronic) sinusitis' and say it cannot be anything like a tumor or something. Probably they are right. Nevertheless, I'm still kinda anxious about the fact that my body doesn't seem to be able to resolve this on its own.Anyone has any idea what else i might be? Is there anything else I can try myself to get rid of it? Anyone with a similar experience?Thanks so much!"

Headache,"Need advice, neck and head pain for two weeks!!!","I am a 48 year old female, started suffering with Migraines about 5 years ago. Went to Neurologist, had two MRI's and was given Triptan (Relpax) for bad migraine. Usually left side of my head, pulsating pain like my eye will fall out if I bend over. Nauseous and dizzy, I realized on my own my blood pressure was high, went to doc and was put on Norvasc. Thank God those typles of headaches went away. Now I am dealing with like a chronic daily headache. If I don't wake up with one I will get one eventually as the day goes on. Recently my problem is pain and stiffness in my neck. Radiates up the back of my head into my eyes and temples. I went back on Nortriptyline 25 mg then will go up to 75mg. Starting to help a little bit. I just don't understand why I get so fixated on anything physical that happens to me. I makes everything worse..I am asking if anyone knows how to stop obsessing about aches and pains..very depressing!! "
Headache,Sharp & dull headaches,"Like alot of people I had a pretty stressfull December, it culminated in shouting at my kids when they were playing up royally (exceptionally so for them as they are usually well behaved), after the shouting I felt a horrid pain in my chest which took several days to disappear. At the time I didn't feel it was A&E worthy and I wouldn't have been able to go as I had no childcare. I put this down to over stressing myself and that the symptoms would go away with time.The pain subsided and I thought nothing more of it, however since that time (and possibly before) I have been getting quick sharp headaches on the top left of my head, which I can only equate to being stabbed in the head and I often feel it still there in an dull everpresent feeling which is more obvious at times than others.I have a doctors appt on the 29th (the earliest I could get), whilst I am not overly concerned about the symptoms and dont feel the need to push for an earlier appt I thought i'd ask if anyone else has had these symptoms?Thanks,Rich "
Headache,Constant headache for 2 weeks!,"Hi, for the past 2 weeks I've had a constant headache. It has never really gone away. I've been to the doctor and have no bacterial infection. They have taken 3 blood samples and results back tomorrow. I've also been to an opticians and she advised I'm slightly short sighted but this would not be the issue all of a sudden. I'm sick with the worry that I've a tumour or something. Would getting a MRI scan rule out any cancer? I'm thinking of getting one done privately. Do I need to be referred by a doctor? Any advice would be great. Thanks"
Headache,Fed Up... Where to go next if my Occipital Nerve Stimmulator doesn't work,"HiI'm new to this site and want to ask if anyone else has had an Occipital Nerve Stimmulator fitted and if it was a success. I had it fitted in March 2014 and had to have the wires adjusted as they were causing problems in my neck and not helping my migraines. I had about 5 week of some relief and my medication intake did reduce. However, in September of this year. I felt the machine stop working and had no sensation from it on one side of my head. Over the past week I am no longer able to bend my head over or reach my arms out without getting pain and a pulling sensation at the back of my neck. I have been sent for X-rays this week and am now waiting for the whole procedure carrying out again. I had high hope's on this operation helping. I understand it's not a cure, but I just need help with reducing the severity of my daily headaches/migraines. Has anyone else had equipment failure? "
Headache,Left side back of the head headache,hey guys I just booked in my appointment with the doctor this morning and I have to be honest I cant quiet explain this but I will try my best and please bare with me on this. Woke up yesterday morning round 6am and usually i do a 100push up in the morning an habit i pic up few years bk then shower n on me car.

Headache,Muscle Contraction Headaches. Help!,"Hi, I'm Adam, 16 and I consider myself to be relatively fit and healthy. However, over the past 2 months I have been getting mild ""headaches"" which occur on most if not all days. They do not last all day as they come and go and occur on different spots of the head. I know which spots these are as they are sore when pressed on. I have been to the doctor who advised me to get my eyes checked to see if it was eye strain however, my tests showed my eyes were healthy. After Christmas I went back to the doctor (at this point I was seriously worried about my headaches being a result of a brain tumour), he asked if I had any other symptons (nausia, dizzines) which I did not and whether they ever woke me up in the night, again the headahces were not painful enough that I would wake from my sleep.In the end, he suggested that it could be because of a muscle contraction headache (muscles in head are not relaxed, could be caused by stress as well as many other things), very common in teens, which he then perscribed tablets which were to be taken over a 4 week period. Now, I am just on the two week mark and have noticed only a slight difference in the pattern of the headaches. Before they use to start about 30 minutes after I wake up and become most painful on the afternoon and towards the evening. Now I have noticed that they tend to go away around 11am for a short period but become more persistant around 2pm. What do you think is the cause of my headaches? Do you think it's a muscle contraction headache, a brain tumour headache or something else entirley? I have never had headaches like this before and as you can tell I am very worried. If you can give me advice I would be extremely greatful. "

Headache,Cayenne Pepper saved me :),"Hello Everyone! If you are a sufferer of cluster headaches you will know that you will pretty much try anything, to see if it works, to make these debilitating awful attacks from ever coming back. Here is what I have tried, and nothing worked as good as the last one!!Water treatment seamed to ease the pain slightly. I had a hard time drinking a full glass of water every 30 min. Although I think that is why it helps , while urinating I felt some relief from the cluster headache pain. Sumatriptan, IMITREX, etc etc - Nasal spray - seamed to work pretty good although not completely pain free, and there are some concerns regarding long term nasal spray applications. It actually tastes bitter & horrible & constantly drips down your throat, yuk!Magic Mushrooms - Yes i did say I would try anything to make them go away! I had access to some Liberty Caps (UK local mushrooms) - My attack cycle starts October 23 @ 10:30 am - 2:30pm for 10 days - it stopped my attacks for 2 whole days! And then the beast returned , GRRRR! I couldn't just keep tripping!!!! I run several business and have a big family to look after. So the hunt for the right treatment continued.Coffee and Caffeine Tablets - Seem to reduce intensity, but not by a lot.Cayenne Pepper *****(Capsicum) Yes this worked a treat! *****In fact this is my preferred way to beat the Vicious Cluster Headache! *****I ingested 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper on food or in water. This would give me 100% PAIN RELIEF for 50-60 minutes!!! AAHHHH!!! Simply eat another 1/2 a teaspoon and your free again my attacks last for 4 hours, so i would repeat 4 times. Its actually amazing how the pain instantly goes away! If you suffer from Cluster headaches you must try this treatment!The secret in how capsicum works in its ability to desensitize the sensory neurons within the Trigeminal nerve branches. Capsicum does this by depleting the nerve terminals of a chemical called “Substance P”, the chemical your body produces which activates the nerve fibers that cause swelling and pain throughout your sinus cavity and head.This is why when you eat spicy food usually containing hot peppers, your sinuses open up wide. It’s not the peppers themselves, but the chemical (capsicum) excreted by the peppers. As a cluster headache sufferer who found his solution, I felt obliged to share my experience if it can help you GREAT!GOOD LUCK!MAGNUS"

Headache,Confused and quite scared ,"Hi all,I am a 20 yr old student and my whole life i've never experienced anything quite like this. I don't have a history or familly history of tension type headaches but I had been experiencing quite a few headaches/migranes during a week so i decided to get it checked out with a doctor, from which he suggested firstly trying proranolol 10mg, taking one in the morning and one at night. I carried this out for a month and a bit but unfortunately my headaches continued and if anything felt worse, I could hardly concentrate let alone keep up with my studies at university. So I went back and got my meds chaged to amitriptyline 10 mg every night. Thankfully this worked a treat for a month but then my headaches starting coming back so i doubled my dose to 20 mg but still i was getting headaches. Here is the intreging bit, I ran out of tablets for a week or so and was away on holiday (Dubai) and my headaches stopped completely! everything was exaclty the same from diet to going to the gym. I come back home but within days my headaches start up again. Its getting to the point where I will have to drop out of university since the pain is too much to cope with and study at the same time. I'm not sure if any of you out there have had anything similar to me but any help would be really really appreciated! here you might say have you tried other remedies and i have, almonds did not have an effect, amd the peppermint oil helps for a few minutes then bang the headache is back. If you've read all this thank you for your time!"
Headache,Started getting strange headaches.. Please help,"Some background info:I'm a 21 year old male, in good health apart from suffering from a anxiety and IBS for a while. I have been on 20mg citalopram for about a month now. So the past four or so days I've been getting headaches every day. They are quite random in nature and are always very mild pain wise, just mostly an annoyance. Sometimes they will last a while and will travel round my head, other times it will literally be a pain somewhere in my head for like a second. They seem to trigger from poor lighting and a bright TV or bright lights etc. I'm having to squint a lot because of this. I had an eye exam last week and my eyes are fine apparently. Paracetamol seems to get rid of them and eating food seems to as well sometimes? But then they may randomly come back later. I was wondering whether they are a side effect of the citalopram as I never really got headaches before these four or so days (obviously the odd one here and there, but nothing like this) Obviously as an anxiety sufferer these are quite worrying for me, so what do you guys think? Some reassurance would be amazing for me. Thanks in advance. "
Headache,"I've had a headache for a month, what is wrong with me?","Hi, my name is Adam and I'm 16 years old. About a month ago I started having headaches everyday (I still have them now). The pain isn't constant but instead comes and goes throughout the day and the pain is mild. I do not wake up in the middle of the night because of these headaches but they start first thing in the morning and are on and off throughout the day. I have found that they present more in the night.I have had my eyes checked at the opticions and the results stated that my eyes were healthy. However, I am extremely worried this ""headache"" is a symptom of something more serious like a brain tumour. I can not think of any other cause. If you do, I would be grateful if you could suggest possible causes. Other than the headaches I have had no other symptoms except the occasional blocked nose. I really would appreciate it if you could give help me with this issue as I have never had anything like this before. What do you think?Please help!!"
Headache,Daily headache,"i am in my 50s, started having daily headaches 4 years ago, waking up with them even if I went to bed without pain. Almost always on the right behind my eye. My BP is normal and eye check also fine. The pain sometimes progresses to a full migraine which does respond to maxalt. My GP sent me to a Neurologist 4 years ago. Did a brain scan and started me on Flunarizine. Put on a stone and a half but felt better except a bit low and needing a sleep in the afternoons. Came off it 6 months ago and now on Amitriptylline 20 mg which stops me sleeping and makes me a bit hyper, so I now take 10mg in the morning. Still getting headaches 3 out of 7 mornings. Ibuprofen helps but I am wondering what to do next.....any thoughts?"
Headache,Headaches and Cimitidine,I started to take cimitidine abouta year ago when I had what seemed to be ibs. Quite by accident I found it got rid of the headaches that were non stop for months - the full ears etc. I had to stop taking it when I found it affected me with bad side effects. Then I had a bad cough which plagued me every day for a while and that went and the headaches came back. They are awful and go around the top of my head like a vice. The normalmedication for the headaches either did not work or gave me a bad stomach.In desperation I took one cimitidine and within half an hour it was nearly all gone and two hours later my ears and head were 100% again.Surely this must mean that the headaches are caused by silent acid reflux?
Headache,Headaches: Updated,"Hi, my name is Adam and I'm 16. Recently I went for an eye test because I have been getting headaches for 3 weeks straight, every single day. The pain is dull and comes and goes throughout the day. I am concerned it could be something quite series like a brain tumour. My eye test showed that my eyes are healthy. Does that mean I don't have anything to worry about because they looked behind my eyes for any pressure to the brain and found nothing. If it isn't what do you think it is and how can I make them go away."
Headache,head & neck ache for 4 weeks. ,I'm on Topiramate (2 tabs twice daily) and have been for a good 8 months or so now. I've now been put on Naproxen and 15/500 cocodamol to help with this pain and it doesn't seem to be helping. Pain in neck is from position I hold it because of pain in my head (I think). I'm holding it to the left because if I hold it upright the pain in my head is worse. Pain in head is really weird and varies from dull ache to stabbing to sharp and quick to burning sensation. Its in back and its above ear. Also get a headache in forehead. I'm experiencing dizziness too & a strange spaced out feeling. I just don't feel right at all. Any insight into what could be cause of this or what could help? I think I'm going to get another doctors appt. next week.

Ranging from the front, behind eye, side and just above my neck. I've also had dizziness, nausea, left side doesn't feel right, tiredness, lack of concentration, and a kina spaced out feeling. I've been to the doctors and emergency hospital numerous times and had my eyes checked fine and all of them say that I have nothing to worry about, even though I think they should be giving me a scan...."

Headache,Tooth ache that seems to be spreading to other locations.,"I started to get a tooth ache, and due to money I haven't yet been able to go and get my self checked out at the dentist (I'm waiting to see if I've been succesful in applying for the HC2).

It's been just over a week now.It's begun to sprea, I now have a very pressurised headache near the temples, as well as mild earache that almost feels like blocked ears.Does anyone have any idea as to what might be ailing me.I strongly suspect I'm overly tired (cause of my headache and earahce) As it's been difficult to get to sleep with the tooth ache."

Headache,A Long Story for a Long headache - advice to give - advice needed.,"Im posting firstly with empathy for those suffering chronic headaches amoung other symtoms & medication side effects which go hand in hand. The secound reason is having been fortunate to have seen top nuerologist - nerve speciliasts & dentists. No stone left unturned within my 10 month ongoing nightmare but like you giving up is not an option. I hope my story can help others while maybe you can help me?CH are triggered off by a number of reasons so wether the cause is relevant will depend on tests results. In my case severe left sided headaches started 48 hrs after root canal but there were others factors surrounding the week in question such as life style, stress/1st ever panic attack due to the severity of the headaches which were new being a perfectly healthy 37year old girl. The 1st neurologist shook my hand ""good news, your MRI, CT, Lumbar puncture & blood tests are all clear"". I didn't share his joy having no answer or cure while stress & 2nd panic attack followed with continued stabbing/throbbing tension type headaches.The 2nd nuerologist sat me down, ""Good news, 2nd MRI with blue dye run through my body, CT scan, Blood tests are all clear but there are signs of muscles spams in your neck - 6 weeks of physiotherpay & prescription of pills (antidepressants - amitiplyine & Naproxen will break the daily headache cycle"". I wasnt convinced but did as I was told completing physio & acupuncture with no real results.Within a week of taking these medications my mood became sucidial low with uncontrollable tears & anger. The nightmares were intense. I stopped eating. Numbness/pins & needles took over the left side of my body, sleep deperived & stressed severe heart palpations started. The stress triggered screeching deafening tone in my left ear which appears to be permament & fluctuates in tone depending on the strength of headache.My GP switched me immediatley to an antidepressant 'Nortriplyline', the same family of pain managememt medication but the side effects were torable depending what one can tolerate?. I became heavily consitpated, no libido, weight gain, insomnia/nightmares & new symtoms developed 'TMD' (Jaw inflammtion/clenching). As long I wasnt slitting my wrists I was grateful for some pain relief but found anything above 10mg (normal dose 25mg) would trigger numbness, tounge swelling & increased general side effects so combined my meds with over the counter pain killers which helped.My nuerologist becoming increasingly annoyed by me insisting such extreme side effects could only be in my head since all my results were clear, meds were a low dose & most likely suffering from depression. I left in tears feeling as if I couldn't maintain my relationship - support & understanding is so important! Im grateful he is still standing by me.Days later I pulled all my medical notes from the nureologist. Don't be afraid to go with gut feeling. I found a new GP who quickly diagnosed it as Nuraligia/Nerve damage, mostly likely caused by an injury & trigger from the root canal made worse by medications & stress. His first line of treatment offered was Carbapazipine which i was cautious to try due to side effects (was told to stop reading horror stories on the internet but in this case ignorance is not always bliss) Agreed to try Gabapentine which intially helped me with some side effects which passed quickly as I remained on a low dose continuing to combine pain killers.The GP gave me confidence to go back to my dentist explaining my situation since the procedure, intially he fobbed me off but I insisted on a referral to a specialised dental hospital. They confirmed TMD believeing the headaches may have been triggered by trauma to the Jaw during the intense 3 hour procedure which I was advised against (always do it in stages). The xrays showed no damage, infection & well performed root canal however physical tests showed extreme sensitivty yet there was no nerve? Keep the tooth or extract it against dentist's advice?Weeks later my health went down hill fast as i suffered intesfied headaches, numbness, burning on the soles of my feet, extreme short of breath, unable to walk a meter to the toilet, the pain was agnosing. I had rushed myself 3x to emergency, the panic attacks became frequent, every 6-8hours till I refused to leave the house. The hospital sent me home each time dosing me up on Xnanx & diazpam for 2 weeks until I didn't know what day of the week it was. Literally everyone became unsympathic & bored by the drama including my parents, so took it upon myself to search the internet & ask a handful of top private hospitals to find a specialist who could help. The waiting list was long even for private health care but I was deteremined to hold on to see the right person. 3rd Nuerologist/Nerve specialist who I had waited several weeks was unable to make it through the consultation, instead had me rushed to hospital, within 45 min I had camera up one end & down the other. My stomach was bleeding from over medicating & 2 stomach ulcers, acid filling my lungs, unable to breath, my insides inflammed. It was a definate low point lying in hositpal feeling sedated, 18 pounds over weight, my body failing me, all within 10 months.Upon recovery I thanked the specialist for acting accordingly. He arranged an EMG/Nerve conducation test and set up a consultation). With results in hand. This was his advice:""ALL results are clear. What we do know is you have 'Chronic Headache', 'Stomach Ulcers' & ""Anxiety'. Prior to this you were healthy. Anixety/Panic attacks are triggered by headaches so there are no mental health issues or depression. Any doctor that diagnoses you with 'Nuraligia' means they have no idea whats wrong with you therefore its as is, a chronic daily headache. Stomach ulcers have been caused by over medication. You take an average 4 nurofen/paracetmol daily x 7 = approx 28/30 pills a week, 1 month = 120 pills x 10 months = average 1000+ pills! The process to recovery is dealt with in stages. You will never receover if you do not get through the 1st stage of detoxing your body from pain killers. Here is a headache diary. I want a record of every pill you take. Slightly increase the Gabapentine which purley works at blocking pain signals which will help keep you off pain killers but it won't be easy, the first 10/14 days will be the hardest but do not take them. Instead drink 2L water daily, 400mg Ribo B2, 600mg Lipho Alpha Acid & pro biotics. Once your blood is clear of over counter meds then we reduce Gabapaentine with the goal to get you off all medication as they often cause the problems. Once at that stage we take it from there. Regarding the tooth, though not a dentist, extract it, bridge it & rule it out as it will only play on your mind as being a possible cause.""Im going to follow his advice and hope this encourages others, its been 10 days now & had some hard times but staying positive & will keep you posted.p.s. I gave up smoking / No alcohol "
Headache,"Fainting, Weakness, Tingling, Cluster Headaches...Confused?","Fainting, Weakness, Tingling, Cluster Headaches...Confused?Hi, I'm new to this so apologies if I'm going about this all wrong.I'll start by telling you who I am. I am a nineteen year old female student. I consider myself to have been in a good standard of health up until this year, however, illness has been a factor in my life as my mother is currently fighting her fifth battle with cancer and is a sufferer of Lupus and Sjogren's syndrome.In January of this year I became unwell, just with the general winter bugs that go around but after a month I was still suffering. Eventually, I phoned home and my parents decided to come and collect me from University as I was displaying symptoms of bacterial meningitis. I was taken to hospital and told it was a culmination of severe infections but not thought to have been meningitis. I was also diagnosed with cluster headaches. I returned to University and while I continued to be somewhat weak and still suffered the headaches but generally healthy.Three weeks pass and bring us up to date, I am currently home from Uni for spring break. Two days ago I attended a gig in a local bar with my family, we were stood; alongside many others, when I suddenly felt very sick, I looked around to find the exit and then toward my mother to try and tell her that I was going to be sick and wanted to leave but I couldn't seem to speak, she said something to me but my hearing had become muffled and somehow the silence was deafening, I looked at my feet and everything faded to black. I assume I passed out. The next thing I remember is being outside with my Dad shouting my name. I am told I hit the deck hard and was carried outside. I was incredibly hot and sweating but shivering and complaining I was cold. I had a sharp pain at the base of my neck, and my left leg was numb from the knee down, as was my right arm from the elbow down. Two days have passed now and I am still felling very odd. I still have tingling sensation in my finger tips and toes but the majority of numbness has gone. I am still going through phases of being extremely hot and sweaty and yet shivering. I have had the stabbing pain in my neck every now and again. I have had another headache, but that is normal as I suffer them three of four times a week. I am just a little confused. I would like to see a doctor but I am no longer registered at a doctors here and I live in a very rural area where there is no real chance of seeing an emergency doctor. I have been told by a few friends and my parents to go to Accident and Emergency but I don't feel that it is really that serious. Any thoughts, gratefully accepted! Thanks in advance! "
Headache,Wake up with headaches?,"Most mornings I seem to wake up with a headache? This morning I woke at 04.30am with a headache, still got it now 3 hours later?Any idea why this is happening? Could it be dehydration as I don't tend to drink anything in the evening? "

Headache,Constant headaches/migraines for the last 6 years...,"I am 19 years old and have been suffering from constant headaches/migraines that have been ongoing for over 6 years now. The pain that they cause usually ranges from bearable where I am able to block the throbbing feeling, to extreme pain where I cry and am unable to focus on anything. My doctor and the neurologists over the years have not been helpful as they have been unsuccessful in finding out what my problem is. My doctor has said that stress may be the cause and when I am not stressed anymore the headaches/migraines would stop. The only thing that I don't understand about this is that I can't be stressed 24/7. The neurologist I visited in January told me that my problem may be 'New daily persistent headache' or 'Chronic migraines'.I have been given various different medications. Gone for many neurologist appointments with not much success. I have had a CAT and MRI scan done, but the results did not show anything unusual. I stopped taking any medication prescribed by doctors as they do not help with relieving the pains of my migraines. The current way that I deal with the problem is that sometimes; music, going for walks or even just sitting outdoors can help.The migraines have caused me to suffer from back and muscle pains. When I find my migraines are at their worst I am unable to concentrate, think and feel completely drained. My headaches/migraines make me feel quite nauseous and make my eyes quite sensitive to the light. In the last month my eyes have been 'blacking-out' for about 5-10 second periods where I begin to feel really dizzy and sick. This has happened before, but in the last month have become quite regular. The headaches/migraines make it hard for me to remember things, as my focus is on the pain that I am in. When the migraine pain gets really unbearable I can't help but cry because I have no idea what to do. It is at times like this that I usually try to fall asleep as that would usually help in making me feel a bit better.This issue has made it really difficult for me during my education, as I find it really hard to concentrate in lessons. It was also due to this problem that I had to redo a year of college, as I wasn't able to do the exams well. The issue is really bothering me as I am hoping to go to university in September and don't want the headaches/migraines to affect my education there.I would really gratefully appreciate if anyone can give me any answers as to how to relieve some of the pain or things that have worked for them.Jessie"
Headache,Severe Headaches getting Me Down,"I have suffered headaches for many years, ranging from mild tension/sinus type headaches to severe debiltating can't do anything headaches which exhaust me. My ""bad"" headaches have become increasingly worse over the last year to the point where I am either on sick leave or using holiday leave & now at the point of final formal warning. I enjoy my job as an RMHN but i'm struggling at the moment. Various GP's/hospital doctors/alternative therapists have diagnosed me with different things so as to try all the known treatments. Sprays for ""sinusitis"", migraleve/imigran etc.. for ""migraines"", neuroleptics for ""tri-menial neuralgia"", various analgesics for ""cluster headaches"", a bespoke mouth guard for ""Temporomandibular joint disorder"", various diets for ""allergies"", chiropractic for ""neck problems"", citalopram for the depression associated with so much pain which may be ""psychosomatic"" or ""stress"". I won't go into the various alternative therapies, which have helped, but only short term unless you can afford time & money daily. I am currently taking dihydrocodeine (double dose as now tolerant), oxycontin & Longtec, which is oxycontin slow release, & still on the citalopram. I know all this medication is adding to the problem & causes re-bound headaches, however, when I attempt to reduce, the pain is worse than ever & requires even more medication. I am stuck in this horrendous cycle & feel no-one can help. I have had one MRI scan 3yrs ago which showed ""flairs"" but was inconsequental. I have ""plodded on"" with help via analgesia for so long it is losing it's efficacy. On return to my GP i was restarted on the various meds tried in the past with little success again & have booked a private consultation at £200 which has been already been cancelled/changed on 4 occasions. If there are any new treatments that others have had with some success, PLEASE let me know......"
Headache,Anyone still take Dosulepin? ,I have been taking dosulepin for 5 weeks now and when I first started taking them I was on 25mg after 3 weeks I had to up it to 50mg and in 2 weeks time I have to up it to 75mg. I am taking this for tension headaches and migraines. When I first started taking this medication it seemed to be working for about 2 weeks but since then I am having headaches everyday again and having to resort back to taking strong pain killers. I have noticed a few side effects like fast heartbeat and hot flushes every now and again. But now I have noticed that my period is late and missed periods isn't listed as a side effect on the leaflet that came with the medication so I decided to look it up on the internet and every post that I found is from at least 4/5 years ago. So I was just wondering if anyone else was having this as a side effect? If people are still taking this medication. 
Headache,What is causing my pain?,"I have been having very bad headaches the last few months and am trying to figure out what the cause is. I have seen a few doctors, and they now say it is coming from my jaw. The first doctor thought is was TMJ, and referred me to a specialist. That specialist said it was not the joint but my muscle. He was able to isolate the muscle and notice the spasm and extreme tightness. He has said heat and regular medicine should help, but I have been dealing with this pain for a long time and know that isnt the case. Does anyone have any ideas what might be going on?"
Headache,"It is over 3 weeks and my headache it just getting worse, plz help","I have been having a sharp pain in the left side of my head for over 3 weeks 24/24. I can't sleep at night and when I get badly tired I fall asleep and then after few hours it wakes me up again. I took paracetamol and it didn't help at all and then ibuprofen 400mg it eases the pain a bit but I still feel it, and again it just takes 3 to 4 hours before the effect of ibuprofen wears out. In about a week now I feel and hear clicking and popping sounds in my head and they make the pain worse. Also sometimes when I lean forward, sneeze, cough, shewing or just walking the pain gets worse.I just stepped out of the misery of having urticaria for over 4 months and now this is happening... What can this be plz? It is making me desperate, and depressing me too bad "
Headache,What is causing terrible sinus and head pressure?,"I have been dealing with sinus pressure, blurriness at times and severe headaches that has been worsening this past year. I got allergy tested in high school And was told I'm not allergic to anything. That was at least 4 years ago. Recently I was seen by an ENT where my MD looked at my sinuses through a camera and said there wasn't anything abnormal. He then put me on abx to rule out infection, did a sinus ct and put me on antihistamines. Everything came back normal With the CT. The abx and antihistamines didn't work either. My ENT then referred me to a neurologist where she dx with migranes. I got put on two different medications ,noretripyline first with bad side affects, and then nadolol which made my sinus pressure worse. I feel like I have tried everything and no MD knows what the exact answer is to make me not so miserable. The pressure is affecting my day to day life and need some help! "
Headache,Headaches and alcohol,"Hi!I am a 38yo male, 10 and a half stone (147lbs), good physical health generally (apart from headaches, anxiety and depression).I tend to suffer from bad headaches. I first suffered when I was about 15/16yo at school, and had a lot of time off. Then after I left school they stopped. They were migraines I think, I had to take 2 paracetemol and go lye down in a dark room and I'd always wake an hour or so later with the headache gone. From what my doctor said at the time, I put it down to hormones or stress, due to not liking school and having a bit of mild bullying.Since then (up until the past 7yrs) I only ever, had a headache (apart from once in a blue moon) the morning after I drank, and they were always pretty bad. I then drifted onto drugs and onto hard drugs like heroin in my early 20's. I never had a headache at all. Then bam, after being clean off heroin for 6months, I smoked some in the morning (after about 6 weeks of being back on it again) and about an hour later, I felt sick, and got an excruciating headache. I had to go lye down and took a paracetamol. I woke up and projectile vomited. Everytime since then, if I took heroin, I had a bad headache. I don't know what happened, but think I have damaged my brain somehow. I eventually in 2007 got off heroin, had a 2yr relapse in 2008-2010, but only dabbling on it from time to time and smoking only (as used to inject it also) but since Oct 2010, have stopped completely and never looked back.I have since though, been getting a bad headache off drinking. I don't want to go mad, I would just like to have a normal night out, just have 5 or 6 pints on a night, but I can't. It's killed my social life. So I have subsequently stopped drinking, didn't have a drink for about a year, till about 9 days ago. I had 3 cans of lager in the fridge, and I like a cold can of lager, so I decided to have one. It was ok, and I woke up the next day fine. A couple of nights after, I had the other can of lager (same brand), and again, woke up the next day fine. The third time though, a couple of nights after, I drank the third can (different band, same strength, about 5%), and woke the next day with a headache. I must say, I always tend to wake with the headache these days. I never develop one during the day. I either wake with a bad headache straight off, or wake with a bit of a headache, and it progressively gets worse and worse during the day. Anyway, after that third can, and waking with the bad head the next day, I took a paracetamol, and as the day progressed (took ibruprofen and more paracetamol during the day too) it just go worse and worse. The strange thing is, is the kind of headache. It's hard to describe it. The one I got the other day, was kind of like, this is the only way to describe it, like a burning kind of sensation almost. Well it wasn't a dull ache, wasn't a pulsing or throbbing headache and wasn't a pressure or band headache, which I have had before.Forgetting the previous history build up though, and sticking to the alcohol related headache, and the type of headache I had the other day, has anyone had a headache like this, or know kind of headache it is? it lasted 4 days off and on too, but I was taking paracetamol and ibuprofen periodically. It went yesterday evening (Tuesday) but started on the Saturday morning, after drinking that can of lager the night before. I mean 1 can of lager is hardly much, and to have 4 days of feeling like crap with an off and on headache. These headaches I get just make me sad and depressed and a bit moody also. I want to find out why, what's causing them, and how (I know not drinking) but how to eradicate them. I think it's some kind of chemical imbalance, something I've altered drug wise, in my honest opinion. I've asked my doctor to refer me to a headache specialist but doesn't seem like he wants to. Just sent me to see a therapist for my anxiety and depression. He seems to think they're anxiety related which could be a possibility but that wouldn't explain why alcohol affects me so bad would it."

Headache,Does daily medication help migraines,"I have suffered for years with regular headaches, the doctors never really managed to help, but at last I have been told that I need to take daily tablets to try to prevent them. I also have bad sinus problems so cant take the usual medications. Has anyone had success with using the daily medication to prevent there headaches or do they just make you feel sleepy and lethargic.Interested on your thoughts "
Headache,Complicated Headaches,"Hi ive been to the doctor a few times over a period of time about this but I dont really get much of a helpful response. Its just dismissed and I get told take painkillers. So anyway about my headaches, its usally worse on a Saturday, I wake up with a funny feeling in my head and eyes, gradually getting worse and seeming to center in a particular spot in my head (top middle just to the right) if I do something to cause my heart to beat faster like stand up quickly or lift something it causes alot more severe pain in that 1 spot and I can feel there each beat of my heart, its like a sharp pain like ive been hit on that spot with a hammer. This type of headache will be with me all day long.Its consistent, if I change my sleeping scedual even tho I give my self the same sleep time this will happen. This made alot lot worse if I sleep longer than my optimum time of just under 8 hours, I avoid that at all costs. If I have the right amount of sleep but stay in bed with my eyes closed and rest it will again be very bad, if I have the right amount of sleep but stay in bed with my eyes open and watch tv or just rest I will have the same just less severe. If I take pain killers then sometimes it helps sometimes it does nothing and sometimes it can make that precise area in my head very very painful like.. I cant explain maybe Like a nail has been driven in my head, feels like maybe theres a blockage and blood cant flow causing immense presure, I dont know. I am prone to a higher than average general headaches. I dont drink alot I smoke only 1 cigarette in the evening if that, I try to drink plenty of water but I also have a issue there, I need to wee alot. I wake up alot in the night needing the toilet and find if I need to go but dont wake up that will cause me to have a bad head getting worse as the day goes on.This is starting to drive me mad ive lost so many days to this over the years but I dont know what to do, any advise on this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance "
Headache,I have suffered from chronic tension headaches for at le...,"I have suffered from chronic tension headaches for at least 15 years and three day migraines for at least 25 years. You may be surprised that I have never been to the doctor's in relation to the migraines, which have tailed off to about three a year (0f three days of migraine each time). I have taken Syndol over the counter for the last ten years, and although this does not stop the migraine, which usually occur at about 4 am and is already virtually untreatable. The Syndol eventually makes me sick and along with lots of water, I'm afraid that I let it take its course and get on with my life as best I can (which can be a struggle), until the three days of hell are over, when taht drained feeling sets in. Now the severe tension headaches are another matter. I have consulted physicians on a few times over the last 15 years, resulting in xrays of my neck and head, revealing no obvious problem, apart from a small fracture of the second vertibrae, which I can't remember doing - and has healed well. I have also tried allergy testing and altered my diet accordingly, but to no avail. So these days I can honestly say that I have a headache (neck headache that is) every day of my life. Yet I have never smoked and dislike alcohol (teetotal) and am 6ft 1"" tall and about 12st 9lbs and run four times a week over 6.5 miles - so I often wonder why I should suffer from these severe tension headaches - because I can honestly say that I simply don't feel at all tense within myself That area around the band at the back of the neck just seems to be my weak spot, which when I become angry or tense or talk too much over say a loud music backround, this can make the tension of my upper neck muscles much worse as can some kinds of food or smokey rooms etc. The Syndol never ever completely gets rid of the symptoms, but will definitely improve them. I can best describe the feeling sometimes as like a car sickness neck headache. Most people think that I am very fit due to the fact that I run a lot and walk or cycle to work - yet they don't realise that I have simply put up with this condition as part of my normal life for so long. However, I don't want any strong medication for the condition and ideally I would like to not have to take Syndol either - but I think that I may be addicted to it. Any comments that will help me are worth listeming to. Mike.[i:f666a9936d]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:f666a9936d]"

Headache,suffering cluster headaches 13 yrs,"hi i am 36 yrs old and been a cluster headache suferer for 13 yrs. I was only diagnosed with this condition however 3 yrs ago. The pain is so unbearable i have like others resorted in banging my head on walls and doors , feels like you are having a heammorrage and is very frightening . I for years was trying to treat these headaches with ibuprofen and cocodemol.Without any effect and i feel like when you say to anyone bout these headaches they are not on the same wave length and find little sympathy , i have however a very supportive husband and friends. This has been invaluble because at times i have felt so low and exhausted from the pain i have considered suicide , and only for the sake of my children has probably kept me going. I find it very dibilitating and cannot cope with anything when in pain so having 3 kids becomes very hard to deal with.I have been misdiagnosed with sinnusitis and since moving doctors and bein admitted to hospital has my diagnosis been clear.I am now being referred to a neurologist so hope they have all the answers !! I am taking verapermil 120mg once a day now this is used to prevent the clusters and has just been effective in my last bout of 4 weeks .My clusters typically happen at night and i get 2 a day at least and they last from 3 - 6 weeks at a time .I am using sumitriptan nasel sprays but like to use the injections as reading on other experiences seem to be the most effective way forward long term and oxygen so when i see this neurologist i am going to ask for this. Hopefully this recent attack is finally over and i wont get them for another 3 yrs hears hoping"

Headache,Is My Dr. Wrong About Cluster Headache Treatments?,"I'm a 23 yr old female and I've just been diagnosed with cluster headaches. My Dr. said I just had to put up with the pain and to take Nurofen when it gets too much which doesnt seem to help.The first thing I did when I had the chance was to look up cluster headaches and treatment on the internet, and it said that sumatriptan injections should be used as a first line treatment, so I rang my Dr. up and he told me that they were only used for migraines and they wouldnt work for me. He has prescribed one tablet for me to try but I havent had it from the chemist yet. Just wanted to know if it's worked for anyone else and shouldn't it be an injection he should prescribe? I read that tablets (5-ht1 agonists) don't take the pain away fast enough and that painkillers dont do anything to lessen the pain.Would appreciate any response...Vikki"
