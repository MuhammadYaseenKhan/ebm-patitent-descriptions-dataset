Arthritis,Joint pain,"i have been suffering from joint pain for the last 9 months now or nearly. it started as my thigh felt numb like it feel to sleep while i was sat down and then a about a month later i has this aching pain in my big toe which felt like i broke it. and then from there its been pretty much everywhere and nowhere. one minute its in my knee then my finger or wrist and the next i'm fine. first the doctors thought lymes disease or gout. both tests came back ok. then they sent me to the hospital as maybe arthritis and they apparently said no its not or is unlikely as no swelling or redness at all ever. been tested for the gene of spondylitis and came back negative, haven't spoken to doctor on whats next yet.the pain is agonising some times and thats mainly in my knee but it is literally all over and feels like its cotton wool if that makes sense.i aslo have coeliacs disease which i was diagnosed with last june (2018).im worried its something that is been looked over that is also a progressive disease or something"
Arthritis,Multiple Joints Pain - Doctors can't figure out cause! ,"Hello!I am 21 years old and for about the past 5 years I have suffered from joint pains.The pain has progressively been getting worse over time. The joints that are affected are in my hips/pelvis, knees, ankles, wrists, shoulders and lower back. I have been to the doctors many times with no luck! They have given me blood tests, MRI scans of my hips, physical therapy and put me on cocodamol painkillers. So far they have ruled out many potential causes e.g rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, lupus, bursitis, tendinitis and have said that it is not due to any inflammatory problems.Here are some of my symptoms:Joint pain in all joints but is not warm or swollenPain is an ache not sharp painsNo pain when sleeping unless lying on joint e.g hip jointHurts when sitting down in the same position for long periods of timePain persists until pressure is off of the joint (e.g sit down, stop carrying something)Chest Pain and shortness of breath occasionallyJoints only hurt when moving, lying on them or applying pressure to themHeadaches with eye pain occasionally (maybe stress related?)Joint pain is gradually getting worse over time (started about 5 years ago)Joints hurt when proddedCold makes pain worseHeat makes back pain better (heat pack when on period)Joints crack/grate and hurt afterwards (might be double jointed?)The joint pain comes from inside the joint not the whole/around the jointCannot sit crossed legged/kneel/squat/swim without painAny ideas or related stories are welcome!Thank you,E."
Arthritis,Health issues during LOCKDOWN,"My mental health has survived reasonably wellMy physical health has deteriorated considerablySpecifically - My right knee and right hip have caused sleepless nightsI had my left knee, replaced - 4 years ago - but, at the time - my right knee was fineIt is now showing similar signs as the left knee didMy left hand as well - I fell heavily in October 2019 and believe that I may have damaged the little finger joint - it is still painfulBut I am unable to do anything until the lockdown is over !"
Arthritis,I suppose it’s arthritis ,The first finger on my left hand is showing the sign of arthritis a bit deformed but I am experiencing moments of extreme stabs of pain. i can only describe it as a hot needle stabbing and then s burning pain. It comes without warning and the settles down for a few hours. my worry is that it will affect the fingers and thumb of both hands eventually and wonder if anyone can offer any assistance as to how i can stop this painful condition and if this is the way arthritis progresses.
Arthritis,Constant Joint Pain and Cracking,"I have had this issue for a few years now (I am 19), and if anything it's getting worse.My Fingers, wrist, elbow, shoulders, neck, jaw and sometimes knees. Are always in a lot of discomfort. I feel the need to constantly crack all of them, like 1-3 every 10 minutes. They feel really tense if I don't.The more I use the joints the worse the feeling gets. My whole body cracks and grinds with any movement.Is this any concern, what can I do to prevent this from happening, it's destroying quality of life."
Arthritis,Feeling wrist pain getting worse and worse as a 22 years old.,"Over the past 4 years my right wrist has needed 2 surgeries as I hurt it bad playing sport. This meant while it was healing I put a lot of pressure on my left hand to complete most tasks.I play a fair bit of video games and my bar work requires me to use my hands a lot.Over the past few months my left wrist has started becoming really sore after work, gaming, weight lifting ect. I have no idea if its early signs of arthritis or carpel tunnel but I would like to know what exercises, certain foods I can eat or other ways I can slow down the process of me actually getting either of these medical conditions.Thanks."

Arthritis,Arthritis,"Hello, Back in August this year (2019 I was diagnosed with Cervical Spondylosis.MyC5-6 discs are worn....wear and tear from age. I now think I have more goingon as I wake up with painful neck, shoulder, arms, legs, knees, hips and buttocks.The pain is awful. I've recently had a blood test to check my inflammatory markers(CRP) and really hope I don't get diagnosed with Polymyalgia Rheumatica as thereis a risk of getting Giant Cell Arteritis with this condition and if not treated swiftlywith Prednisone steroid tablets there is a risk of blindness.Is there anyone that suffers the same?Thank youAnne"
Arthritis,Thumb Joint Artificial Replacement,Hi allI would love to hear from anyone who has had a thumb joint replaced. I've hopefully attached a picture of the same replacement I had done a couple of years ago. It's like a mini hip joint.Many thanks
Arthritis,Some form of arthritis,"don't get me wrong I'm happy someone is finally taking me seriously and not looking at me as an age(I'm 29) yes there only looking into my hands atmo but it's finely a good start after 16years of arguing over all the pain im always in . I've got an x-ray coming up up on the 7th of Jan as I've got bone growth on my finger joints And I'm struggling to hold things ie unable to use a knife and fork properly due to the pain and stiffness, both my parents have this and been told its osteoarthritis what's the chances I could also have this? And is there anything I can do in mean time to help make things easier or lessen the pain I'm on alot of meditations for my hips/knees/wrists And back but doesn't help with the pain in my fingers."
Arthritis,Achy bone for a month after a sexual encounter,"im 30 years old, been having achy bone a week after a sexual encounter.i have many other weird symptoms but achy bone is the most lasting ones. it started off with bone feeling achy throughout my body. the kind of body ache you get before a fever hits but i had fever. it comes and goes. its mild generally but its uncomfortable. sometimes i feel it on my legs, sometimes the arms, sometimes the entire body. when i google, it says cancer. could somebody please shed some light? i still suspect that its hiv even though i tested negative at 1 month because 1 month isnt really conclusive and all these symptoms just makes no sense and there really isnt many other causes of achy bones."
Arthritis,Arthrodesis-Anyone have this?,"I am considering arthrodesis (A surgery to immobilize your joint by screwing a plate onto the bones) for my wrist which has become quite bad from osteo and inflammatory arthritis. I am worried It will not really relieve pain for the loss of movement involved. If anyone had this and tell me what you are like afterwards, I would appreciate it!"

Arthritis,Basal thumb arthritis - how do you manage,"I've got OA in my thumbs which make everyday tasks painful. Such as putting on my socks, holding a drinking glass or putting on my seat belt. I wear a thumb brace on both hands most of the time. How do you handle these kinds of things."
Arthritis,Whole body dull muscle aches. Any ideas,"Mid 40s male.Beginning about 5 years ago I began experiencing constant pain and it's gradually getting worse. It is not any worse when I move. It does not increase on touch. It's a deep pain, although sometimes I get muscle cramping too. It's not isolated to any particular area - it's body wide. It is the worst in the morning when waking, but constant throughout the day. About 600mg ibuprofen will make it a bit more tolerable during the day and let me be more active. I've had all the standard tests for arthritis come back negative. I've been physically active all my life in sports etc. Now, It's a pain to get up and simply walk. Any insight as to what I should explore other than arthritis etc? Thank you."
Arthritis,A Level Product Design Help,"Hi my name is Mia and i'm 17. i am doing a design project centered around arthritis at school for my A Levels, so i was wondering if anyone could help me out.Do you have any problems in your day ti day life that i could help by creating a product to solve that problem?Are there any products/ gadgets you use that help you with arthritis that you think need to be redesigned to improve their function?Or if you have any other information that you think could be helpful.Thanks"
Arthritis,Stem Cell Injection,"I have gone through the Stem Cell Injection to my hips and knee and finished up the last injection two weeks ago. The one before it and after it was platelets.I was told not to take Motrin but tylenol. I couldn't do it. Without Motrin I couldn't even get in the bed to sleep at night I was so stiff. They said it wouldn't make or break it but I am reading that it does. Has anyone gone through stem cell on their hips and if so did you follow the exact procedure? How soon did you see results and did you see them without physical therapy?Thank you,"
Arthritis,I have had sever foot pain coming on 3 months,"Sorry First post!I have been having an issue with my feet for the past two years where one or the other becomes too sore to stand on. This could last from two to four weeks and usually stop for about eight weeks in between.Recently, I have been having the pain consistently on one foot or the other. I have been to my doctor multiple times in the past few months and have been semi-diagnosed with gout as they aren't 100% sure if it is it or not. The pain isn't around my big toe it is affecting the top of the foot and the outer part of the bottom of the foot. I have changed my diet to a mainly vegetarian one having meat once a week and consume alcohol once a week.Would love some advise on what i should do to get this treated or if it sounds like how gout is meant to behave. Thanks in advance!"
Arthritis,Hip and knee problems doctors taking time to help.,"Hi all, sorry if this is a common problem.but ever since i was walking i always walked a bit strange, not glaringly obvious, bit of a limp, and when younger on my tip toes until i forced myself to walk heal to floor first so its natural now. my mum took me to doctors as a child, which apparently was told i would grow out of it im now 24. apparently i was hip checked a couple of times as a mandatory check whilst under 6 months old, i found the records. all fine.anyway the last 2-3 years ive been in considerable pain with my R knee. it first started off as a slight grinding sound, now its ridiculously loud and crunching, popping etc. went see a GP over uncomfortable feelings in knee, and the crunching. my GP whipped off his shoe and swiveled his ankle round and said, ""we all click in joints nothing wrong with you"" he didnt even get me to make them crunch, or even look at my legs.i explained the feelings i have and he said ""if youre that concerned go refer yourself to physiotherapy"" which i did.12 weeks later i see a physiotherapist and basically instantly get signed off as even though im in pain, ive still got good mobility..along with that ive had my hip clicking all my life both sides, just when i walk, ive never really paid much attention to this, as ive never known my life without it, but now its very painful on days especially if i walk a distance or go up the stairs, right deep within the groin.Ive genuinely gone to GP around 18 times for this issue, and then they started fobbing me off as anxiety. which by this point i am probably getting apprehensive that im conscious that my joints are being ground to a pulp.its clear ive got knock knees always have. you dont need to be a scientist to work that out. but GPs wont even look.anyway. now ive seen another GP at same practice. 5 months ago.after complaining numrous times.he took one look at my legs and said 'do you know you have knock knees'he also did some mobility flexes to me, and said 'thats not right, im sending you for xray'well now other knee is doing exactly the same (starting to)xray has come back, my ball (fits into socket) is smooth and fine on knee, its satisfactory.. which obviously was a shock because im in agony in bed, cant do much exercise or walking, without pain flaring up. walking round shops is embarrassing as you can literally hear grinding with every step if your in a 10ft vicinity of me, some days are better than others. he said he wants to focus on knee first then hip. why cant they just diagnose both, then work out a care plan on one at a time once i know.i just dont know where else to turn. anyway this one GP is nice. and he has referred me to a MSK clinic he said they are GPs with more power.?? why cant he just refer me to joint specialist ? anyway my appointment is in September, that will be 4 years since initial appointment.. i literally cannot wait any longer. i just genuinely cannot cope no more. 24 with mobility issues?? then when i go to MSK clinic, im worried they will discharge me instantly. like physiotherapy and i have to start again, or ill have to wait till december (NHS waiting times) for more scans e.g MRI i really cannot wait that long. hard because people who dont really see my often cant see how much its effecting me, because to them nothing is wrong, nothing has changed. a regular member of public wouldnt instantly know im struggling to walk. like i cant even stand still for long periods, its like a dire need to sit. i am 5ft 7 9st 10lbs so not over weight either.sorry for long post. any ideas would be great of what it could be, or just general help. sorry again ."

Arthritis,"Sudden Leg/Hip Pain Woke Me Up, what is happening?","When I went to bed, I felt fine. In fact, I felt great! I was finally feeling better (after 2 weeks battling bronchitis) & I had just hula hooped in the park that afternoon to celebrate. BUT around 4am, while I was lying in my usual fetal position on my left side, I was awakened by a sudden extreme pain in my right thigh where my leg & hip connect. I thought: maybe it's the way I'm laying? So I tried to lay on my back. No luck. The pain only intensifies. My instinct was to go find my muscle rub. Limping around for a few minutes (I couldn't put any weight on it), and unable to locate said muscle rub, I grabbed my heating pad and wrapped my leg in it for some temporary relief. That's where I am now. I have a big day on my feet tomorrow, but I can barely walk right now. What is happening & do I need to see a doctor?"

Arthritis,thumb arthritis stem cell therapy,"Has anyone had stem cell therapy on a thumb? I am a 70 year old woman interested in Bone Marrow, and PRP injections but have not found anyone who has had this procedure done. Wondering if it will be worth it. I realize there is no guarantee of success, but did it help you and for how long?"
Arthritis,Chronic backache causes by hip arthritis,Has anyone else experienced hip arthritis that also gives you low back pain. I am 70 years old and have hip arthritis with all the accompanying groin pain etc. It seems to be affecting my back too. The longer I spend on my feet the more my back hurts.

Arthritis,Terrible swelling after breaking ankle and leg,"I broke both bones in my lower leg, resulting in a lot of skin damage as they broke through the skin. I also managed to fracture my ankle.I had two surgeries. there is an IMB nail in my bone and my ankle is pinned in places. Hard to know whats been done exactly as I am still waiting to see my surgery notes and was too out of it when they explained it in hospital.Mainly in hospital they were focused on my horrific skin damage. Now 6 weeks later they are pleased with how my frankenstein looking leg has healed. However i have yet to see an ortho doctor and amconcerned with how swollen my foot is every day and how much my ankle currently hurts. They had me weight bearing from day 4 as couldn't have a cast due to the skin damage and bandages needing to be changed.Was doing really well with my walking and exercises but now it hurts too much to do them. Feeling like I've taken a massive step back in my progress.Anyone else suffering bad swelling?"
Arthritis,Knee Pain,"At 66 I suffered from knee pain, and a pain down the side of my shin for several months. My GP recommended some cream while I waited for an injection into the joint. I have not used the cream nor had an injection. Instead I thought I would try a magnetic bracelet. It took a couple of weeks to work and now I have been totally pain free for two/three months with no medication. I am not sure if this is coincidence or due to the bracelet, but one thing for sure I am not taking the bracelet off."
Arthritis,"My leg hurts when I don't move it, I can't sleep!","Hi,I have pain in my knee that travels up my leg (think it's arthritis) . It's not that bad when I'm moving it but sleeping is a nightmare! I wake up and because the leg hasn't been moved it is very painful. I was just wondering if there are any pillows that anybody has used they could recommend? I'm only 40 so I don't want to start taking tablets everyday.Thanks in Advance!"

Arthritis,Tights aid,Hello I hope this might be the forum where someone might know the answer to my question. I am having trouble putting my tights on. Most of the aids I have seen seem to concentrate on those who cannot pull them up once both feet are in the tights. This is not my problem once my feet are in the tights I can pull them up no problem. The trouble I have is that I can get one foot in but have trouble getting the other one in because I can't get it over the foot with out causing pain in the lower back hips. A couple of times I have done it with difficulty and then found I could not stand up straight. I did this a couple of days ago and this morning the pain was a lot better but I tried to put them on and the pain is back. Any ideas please and where I could purchase what I need. I am 71 oa in neck spine and knees diagnosed possibly hips. Thanks.
Arthritis,basil joint replacement and carpel tunnel,Hi all! I'm KarylI'm in my 7th week after basel thumb surgery and carpel tunnel on my right hand. I had a cast for 4 weeks then a splint for thumb and haft arm for 2 . Now I'm a splint for just my thumb. I'm just this week working on touching my fingers with my thumb. much harder then I expected. My Dr. had told me it would be about 6 to 8 week recovery. I'm thinking it will be longer! Anyone out there with simuler situation?Thanks!
Arthritis,So um.. what is wrong with me?,"Hello everyone.So, this all started one month ago. Out of no where, every morning, it would hurt just below my right ankle. It would go away after 5 or 10 minutes, but I just couldn't walk. No idea why this was happening. Anyways, this happened for about 4 days. I just ignored it. After that, my ankle swelled up like a baloon. For the first three days, I just applied Voltaren and iced it. After no progress, I went to the doctor. He said it was too early to tell what it was, so he prescribed some oral medication. After I took that, I felt much better and my swelling cut down quite a bit. After a few days however, my left ankle began swelling up a little, then the back of my knees began hurting a lot, then my elbows began to hurt, and then my wrist. I also began coughing quite a bit. My parents thought this was all a side effect of that medication, so they asked to stop it. I did that, but my right ankle swelled up like a balloon again. I still had a lot of tightness and pain in my other ankle, knees, elbows, and wrists. Also still had that horrible cough. Like, I had a lot of trouble walking, going to the bathroom, and showering. So I went to the doctor again (a different one), and he prescribed protnozone (however you spell it). However, I didn't immediately go for it, as I wanted to wait a bit before I went on another medication. The doctor also ordered a blood test and x ray for the right ankle. I did that, and the doctor said everything looked fine. He said they tested me for everything, and everything came out normal. So he said what I might have are symptoms of rheumatoid artharitis, without actually having the disease. He said to take either advil or aleeve, and rest, but suggested I take the pretnezone (again, sorry for the spelling). I was on advil and then aleeve that for about a week, but nothing improved. I was still in a lot of discomfort. So my parents took me to the emergency room. I had two different doctors look at me, and they think I might have triggered some muscle pains somehow. So they told me to go on the pretnezone (?). I was prescribed to be on it for 5 days. So I started that, and I literally felt cured. I hadn't felt so good in 3 weeks. So I used up the prescription, but all my joint pain, tightness, and swelling came back (swelling wasn't as intense, but it still was there). And then my coughing picked up horribly. Like I haven't coughed like this ever. At first when this started, it was a dry cough. Now I got a lot of phlegm. This morning, I coughed up some bloody phlegm. After that though, there was no blood. Seriously, this coughing is annoying the hell out of me. For a month now, I have been taking Halls, warm honey water, warm honey and ginger water, warm water with clove, and I suck on clove once in a while to give me a break from the cough. Nothing has worked so far.So what the heck is going on? Do I have some kind of virus? I haven't traveled anywhere, I'm a healthy guy, and there is no family history of any kind of disease. All of this happened to me suddenly on January 26th. Nothing has changed. Only the swelling has decreased on both ankles but the pain and tightness is still strong there, and elsewhere the places I mentioned"
Arthritis,"I've been experiencing a lot different symptoms, that I suspect may be linked to each other.","Age: 17Sex: MaleRace: Scandinavian/Middle Eastern?Height: 6'6Weight: 158 poundsHello,I've for a very long time been experiencing several issues with my body, I suspect that some of these issues may be connected, and I would really appreciate if you could take a look.I have other issues, like bad eyesight, second hand smoker, seborrhoisk dermatitis, which could also be linked.3 Years ago, I caught the worst cold I ever had, which I belive lasted about 2 weeks? I was experiencing extreme fatigue and wasn't really able to do anything for the entire duration, after the sore throat and coughing was gone. I thought I was perfectly healthy, but I was still experiencing extreme fatigue, this went on for like a month, before I got I went to my local doctor, I was told I probably had Glandular fever, and that I would probably go away within like 3-4 weeks or so, I don't remember exactly. 2-3 Months went by, and I was still experiencing these symptoms. I then decided to go to a specialized doctor, who took some blood tests, and I was told that they had too many white blood cells, and I probably had some sort of infection that you get after having Glandular fever. I also went to the hospital to get my throat x-ray scanned, but I don't remember what they suspected it to be, no results. I was told to wait a month, and then get my blood tested again. My blood tests came back, showing no inbalance. I was still experiencing fatigue, this went on for another year, until the symptoms just dissappeared out of nowhere.8 months ago, a cherry sized thing on my back appeared, which turned out to be an infection of the sebaceous gland. I was told to take pencilin/antibiotics, 3 times a day for 2 weeks. 2 weeks went by, and the infection seemed to be gone, only to reppear 2 days later way worse than before. I went to the doctor again, and I was told to take pencilin again, for another 3 weeks. After 3 weeks, this time, it didn't even dissappear, the antibiotics just did nothing at all.. I contacted my doctor, and I was told that it wasn't actually dangerous, and the only real reason to get surgery was if the pain was too much. But she wouldn't recommend it. I still have this issue currently, where it appears and dissappears once in a while, but for the most part I don't experience pain.3 weeks ago, I noticed a non-visible small lump on the back of my head, marked on this picture. https://imgur.com/a/TcSAKHV I went on here to ask for help, and was told that it was probably a lymph node, and I should get it checked out. Which I did, I went to the doctor, and he sort just felt it, and said it was just a sebaceous gland.2 Weeks ago, I started experiencing very uncomfortable pain in both my hands and fingers. I thought that this was probably linked to bad posture, but I got it checked out anyways. I was checked for marfan syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome and hand arthritis, I didn't have any of them. My blood sample did however show that I was D vitamin sufficient and I had too many white blood cells, once again. I didn't have any viral infection going when I got my blood sampled. My doctor concluded that this all could have something to do with too little vitamin d, and told me to take daily supplements, for 3 months. I have started taking these, not really sure if I should be feeling any difference yet, but I am not. This is what I'm the most worried about, since my job is using my computer, and I'm not sure if I cause permanent damage, by still using it. I was 100% that I had carpal tunnel syndrome, since I have been experiencing a sharp tingling sensation very occasionally in my finger tips, starting like a year prior to this maybe a bit less.A week ago, I started getting a weird feeling when I turn my back, it makes this ""grinding noise"", I can hear it pretty clearly, and it feels like I run out of breath or something, when this occurs. Now when I stand up to long, I get this very discomforting pain in the left side of my back until I sit or lay down. I want to get this checked, but I don't know how to explain it to my doctor.That was pretty much everything, I really really hope that someone is able to guide me on how to go about my issue. Sorry for poor explanation but english is not my native language. Questions are very much welcome, I can provide pictures if asked for."

Arthritis, meniscal tear.,Hi I have a meniscal tear and wondered if surgery is needed?
Arthritis,20 year old female with joint/muscle pain + a ton of other symptoms - please help?!,"Hi all,I don't really know where to start with this one. I've been experiencing a number of symptoms since October 2014 and am failing to find a good treatment or diagnosis! I am a 20 year old female in my final year of university and can safely say this final year has been ruined So, I guess it first started in October with a flu-like illness (my GP hasn't confirmed whether it was flu or not) and since then I have not recovered. This illness lasted for approximately 3 weeks, then I felt better for about two weeks. After this two week period of feeling relatively better, extreme fatigue set in in November and December, along with these symptoms:- muscle aches- menstrual irregularities- brain fog (my short-term memory is now horrific, can't concentrate or follow through with thoughts etc)- dry skin- dry eyes- mild weight gainI went to my GP and she suggested I have an underactive thyroid based on a strong family history, but this came back normal twice. She said to come back after the Christmas holidays if symptoms persisted.In December the joint pain started. I first had shooting and burning pains in my knuckles accompanied with some redness but no warmth. Over December/January my MCP joints started to become very swollen intermittently and painful (still no warmth). My shoulders, elbows, wrists, knees and ankles can be added onto the joint pain list, however I have only experienced slight swelling in wrists and ankles. I also have morning stiffness for at least 2 hours, sometimes stretching into the afternoon. In January I also started to experience pain in my lower back, which is sometimes so bad it makes me cry in agony when standing or sitting. The pain in my joints/around my joints improves with movement and becomes worse with inactivity, however as most people will have experienced... really fatigued so want to rest but makes pain worse ahhhh In late January I got a referral from my GP to see a rheumatologist but the NHS waiting time was until June so I was fortunately able to go private. I first saw the rheumatologist in February. He did the normal physical examination, ordered blood tests, x-ray of chest and pelvis and a hand ultrasound.Blood work has come back normal, as have x-rays and ultrasound. The rheumatologist says its a soft tissue rheumatism which should go away soon and was triggered by the virus I had last year. He said it could also possibly be the start of fibromyalgia. He gave me a Depo-Medrone injection in the bottom and said this would help to make me feel better... all its done is caused me grief. Over the past week since the injection I have had very bad muscular pain all over and other symptoms such as loss of appetite, increased stiffness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness (nearly embarrassingly fell over on the spot in a shop at the weekend), sore throat and worsened fatigue. Just very washed out at the moment. I am wondering if I should see a GP about these side effects?The pain levels have only increased in my lower back and this pain is starting to move up my spine, with stabbing pain the ribs. My legs and arms sometimes go numb very quickly. Prior to October 2014 I had the occasional hand tremor but I just didn't think much of it - I am wondering now if this is part of the problem. Should I ask for an MRI scan at my next appointment with the rheumy? I am wondering if something like ankylosing spondylitis or multiple sclerosis is the real problem? I really hope it isn't as serious as that but I feel like 'soft tissue rheumatism' doesn't really explain fully the range of symptoms I've been experiencing? Co-codamol and anti-inflammatories such as naproxen are not working for pain relief anymore.I am sorry for the massive essay! I just want my normal life back and I'm sure so many of you can sympathise with this. I've probably forgotten a lot of things here thanks to my lovely memory problems If anyone could provide any insight I will really appreciate it. Thanks for reading "

Arthritis,Symptoms of Cervical arthritis,"Hello, Over many years I have been diagnosed with osteo arthritis in neck, spine, and knees. During the last few months the neck pain has got worse and I was referred for physio therapy which did help with the pain and stiffness. Now it seemed to have spread to the shoulders as well although I realise that might be part of the spine problem. I have also started having trouble with my hands especially the right one. I get some aching and wrist pain and some tingling in the fingers sort of sizzling. The ring finger but on right hand triggers in the morning but not during the day (I did have a steroid injection in the middle finger for triggering some years a go no pain just the trigger finger and the injection worked). I also have a lot of head aches I assume caused by the neck although I have been a life long headache sufferer with some migraines. I have recently had yearly blood tests for thyroid etc. My gp thought that maybe the thyroid medication needs adjusting or maybe Vitamin D (which I take) or B12 levels. I have not had the results yet. It does seem that once you get over 70 everything is put down to arthritis and you are left to get on with it. What I would like to know is exactly what symptoms any of you with neck arthritis get. This might help me to see where the pains are coming from before returning to the gp. All this is not helped by digestive problems all diagnosed by tests as any pain in the stomach is often felt in the back as many will know. Thank you for reading this. "

Arthritis,I have pain in my wrist that alternates. Help?,"I have had alternating wrist pain in both of my wrists for about three years now. It originally started with my right wrist, and after it faded away my left wrist started to hurt (about a month or two later). It only hurts to bend it, and when I went to a doctor I was given an ace bandage and nothing else (not even advice or a diagnosis). My wrist will slowly start to hurt, getting worse and worse, until it reaches its peak (which is fairly painful) and then it slowly starts to get better. After that I seem to have a month or two of rest before the other wrist starts to hurt. I was thinking it had to do with overuse possibly? My theory originally was that I have somewhat weak wrists and doing simple things like push-ups or holding a door open are hard on my wrist and I injure it. After I injure it, I start to do things with the other hand. I guess that would explain why it switches, but I really have no idea. It would be really helpful to have an idea of what could be wrong with it. I have gone to the doctor multiple times, and I haven’t ever seen my doctor concerned about it. "

Arthritis,I’ve had results back but there still not clear. Any help? ,"Hi, so I’ll go into a little bit of a brief detail last September I was hit with this over whelming pain in my shoulder and went to see doctors who said it was just frozen shoulder. I had physio for 3 months which did not help so he sent me back to my doctor who sent me for a neck X-ray which came back clear. So nearly a year down the line and the pain still there and numbness, pain and tingling down my left arm I was referred to a neurologist who sent me for an MRI and Nerve Conduction test. The results came back last week and the neurologist report says there are no sinister neurological conditions that I have. So my question is where do I go from here because I just seem to be stuck in this loop of hoping to find an answer then being back at square one while still being in a hell of a lot of pain and now struggling to do some daily activities like brushing my hair or putting socks on."

Arthritis,Addicted to dihydrocodeine and pegabalin,"Hi, I'm new to this forum and in quite a bad way health wise, it started approximately 1 year ago, I'm taking sertraline and mirtazapine for treatment resistant depression since the age of 15, I'm now 40 I would like to add. I gradually started getting pain and swelling on both feet and ankles, so after many doctor appointments I was diagnosed with having re-active arthritis in connection with a stomach bug I'd had very recently, very strange I thought?! I was told to elevate my legs and have baths in Epsom salts and the swelling and pain would gradually ease. I also did some research on my condition, turns out that it is possible that some of the bacteria from the stomach can reach different parts of the body and cause exactly the symptoms I was experiencing, but it not very common and only effects parts of the body which are already suffering someway and that you are unaware of?! Anyway the swelling did not get better and it was not long before both my legs were swollen. So again after many doctors visits I was sent to have an X-Ray's on both ankle's, the results came back and showed I had bone osteopytes and my diagnosis changed to ankle osteoarthritis, this was now about 4 months from when it all started, the pain was so bad I was put on codeine which helped at first but then just did nothing even though quite often I would take more than the prescribed dose of 240 mg. My symptoms continued to get worse with more swelling and pain, now in my hips and legs and started to put on a lot of weight due to inactivity, I had a blood test which came back fine, so as far as the doctor was concerned I was O.K?! Now I was put on Dihydrocodeine which helped tremendously and could go about my day no problem at all. Soon enough I found myself taking much more than 8 a day, more like 25-30! It was shocking and could not believe what I was doing to myself, I was far too embarrassed and ashamed to tell the doctor and just said I'd like to come off opioid medication and try something different to manage the pain. Then I was put on Pregabalin, so I started these right away. They worked so well I was able to almost stop my Dihydrocodeine completely, but after a while I found myself being addicted to both and I lost control of things completely. I now to this day take at least 600 mg pregabalin and 300 - 400 mg Dihydrocodeine! Obviously now I am buying elsewhere to keep my habit going. My health to this day is still the same with swelling in both legs with pain and have gained weight rapidly. I hope I have made things clear as the last 1 year of my life has been all over the place and have not spoken out to anyone.Hi, I'm new to this forum and in quite a bad way health wise, it started approximately 1 year ago, I'm taking sertraline and mirtazapine for treatment resistant depression since the age of 15, I'm now 40 I would like to add. I gradually started getting pain and swelling on both feet and ankles, so after many doctor appointments I was diagnosed with having re-active arthritis in connection with a stomach bug I'd had very recently, very strange I thought?! I was told to elevate my legs and have baths in Epsom salts and the swelling and pain would gradually ease. I also did some research on my condition, turns out that it is possible that some of the bacteria from the stomach can reach different parts of the body and cause exactly the symptoms I was experiencing, but it not very common and only effects parts of the body which are already suffering someway and that you are unaware of?!

Arthritis,Knee pain with stiff fingers and stiff back,I am 37 yrs old. I went for an X-ray after struggling with a lingering pain on my left knee. Doctor told me that I have early stage osteoarthritis. I am so scared and confused as I did not expect this to happen to me since I am rather inactive and I am not overweight with a bmi of 19. The problem is that I started to recall that I have been having stiff back and stiff fingers which come on and off for a period of a few years. And these have come back in the last few days. I am not sure if these are related to my knee osteoarthritis. If I wake up in the middle of the night my lower back feels locked in place. There was a few period of time where I woke up in the morning with severe back pain and I couldn't stand straight. I am now worried that my knee osteoarthritis is just one of the symptoms of something larger. Can someone advise me what could I be having ? Is it possible to have osteoarthritis in multiple joints?

Arthritis, Bilateral hip pain and not taking NSAIDs ,"Hi I’ve had arthritis in my hands ( heberdens nodes) mainly for 10 years now, and started to have pain in my right hip about 2/ 3 years ago.went to GP some months ago and she’s sent me for x ray that showed starting of arthritis. I use voltarol cream sometimes if pain is really bad.Now recently I started having pain in my left groin a lot too and now everyday as I’m in activity gets worse. Both hip groins hurt and I can’t take NSAIDs because I have chronic gastritis caused by bile. I’m taking sucralfate for the gastritis for now. I’m in total distress.I went to the gp this week about the hips pain and he didn’t referred me to a rheumatologist but physiotherapist which I don’t understand . I don’t know for sure which arthritis I have if RA or OA. My blood tests are SUPER negative for RA factor. RA runs in my family and having pain in both hips now at 42 I don’t know.I’m thinking in using my bupa insurance to see a rheumatologist instead, and see if he can run more tests. I even researched about stem cells therapy because this pain is unbearable and it’s just the early stages of arthritis. I’m on amytripiline prescribed by doctor for pain but it’s not helping and paracetamol. Has anyone tried the stem cells therapy so far and feel made a difference? I’ve also read about NO-NSAIDs pills but still in research think. I’m dealing with two terrible chronic conditions at moment and I feel depressed a lot . Thank you "

Arthritis,Really stiff and sore finger joints...,"Just wondered if anyone could help? About three months ago my middle finger's second joint on my left hand became really sore and very stiff (especially in the morning). I had to use Voltarol to take the discomfort away and noticed that it was swollen and very sore to touch (but not full of fluid). Then it settled after a few weeks and I hoped it was just a random thing.Then about three weeks ago a couple of finger joints on my right hand have started to do the same thing and I am waking at night with pain and a lot of stiffness. In the morning it is as if they are 'stuck' in the same position and after a little while they come back to life (although remain sore throughout the day).Do you think it could be the start of a kind of Arthritis? Not sure if I should go to my doctor or just buy some joint vitamins or if anyone can help shed light? I eat really well and look after myself, take exercise and starflower and fish oil supplements.Many thanks"
Arthritis,Palendromic rhumetism - food triggers...,"Hi all. New here. I’ve had a PR diagnosis for about 2 years now. Treated/managed with sulfasalizine currently. Since before the diagnosis, I’ve thought that pork-related meats always seemed to trigger the response. I’m now certain of it. Worst reactions come on about 24-36 hours after dry-cured(sodium nitrate??) pork like capicolla/sausages/prosciutto/baked ham etc. Milder(much) reactions come after chops/ground etc. As I’m still putting a list of “do not eats” together....has anyone else had anything similar. I’d love some more insight. Thanks in advance. "
Arthritis,Arthritis in hips. Please help with any advice.,"Hi I need desperate advice about the pain in my hips.My right hip started hurting back in 2014, when my only child was born. I had some bony lumps in my hand fingers and I knew it was some type of arthritis as it runs in the family ( mum’s side). Since then my pain got gradually worse. This year I had an x ray and found out I have some narrowing in the bone in my right hip which explains hurting so much but not all the time. Now my left hip in the groin started aching too so I’m in total panic 😨 because I’m really scared that it’s as well arthritis in the hip. I’m 42 very soon, and I feel my life is going to be very hard to live with this constant pains and aches.I had blood work done to check for rheumatoid arthritis and it is negative but I know I can still have it. I can’t take NSAIDs because I have gastritis so how am I going to cope with two painful hips? I’m living in the UK ( born in Portugal), and I spend all of my time ( when not looking after my little daughter) reading and searching online for new treatments and even possible cure for this terrible disease. Has anyone had any success with some new treatment like stem cells or platelet plasma or injections to treat arthritis . Please someone let me know and God give us all the strength to live .. 😓thanks."

Arthritis,Arms and legs numb during sleeping,"It has been happening for a long time now. I changed the bed and pillow but it did not help.

During sleep it is so serious that It keeps waking me up. I dont like my local gp, he keeps telling me everything is ok. I want to pay to a private doctor to check me thoroughly. Are there private doctors/clinics in uk? What are they called? I travelled to UK to work 8 years ago? I was very young then and had no worries. But now I am being concerned about my health every day. Please advise as I am no getting worried about myselfMany thanks Krum"

Arthritis,Knee Pain For Two Years,"This is my first post, and I am 16 years old, so please bear with me!!Around two years ago, I sustained a knee injury when I was playing ringette, an ice sport similar to hockey. I was tripped, and landed directly on my knee, and when I stood up, my knee gave out. After a month of pain, I seen a doctor at a local hospital whose expertise was knee injuries. The doctor yanked my knee every which way, causing a ton of pain, then dismissed me in an disrespectful manner and said, ""You're fine. There's nothing wrong with you."" However, I know there is damage that was not properly addressed because if there was no injury, I wouldn't be in any pain. Fast forward a week, and I did some physiotherapy and continuously did exercises to strengthen my knee, yet I still had pain. But last year and a year after the diagnosing of the injury, I yet again injured my knee. Rarely ever do I cry when I sustain an injury in ringette, but I cried when I injured my knee. Both times. I had no use of my knee for a week before going right back into strenuous activities. I have had constant pain in my knee that worsens with physical activity, and I am considered an elite athlete, so quitting sports is not an option. I have fallen down because my knee gives out, and I get the pain deep in my knee, on the inner parts of my knee and all around the front of the knee. I want my knee to get better, so please give me some ideas of what my injury could be so I can deal with it immediately, and I don't want my knee to be any worse than it is now."

My question is can anyone with this condition tell me their experience with the following.1. where in the back do you get pain2. what does it feel like3. what helps4 Does it ever seem like it could be affecting digestion.I am due back to my gp on Tuesday, I thought of asking for an MRI scan, gallbladder scan and camera down the throat. I should add I am 70 years of age and have just managed to get through my 70th birthday party this weekend in pain at various times. I also have arthritis in my knees, possibly hips. I have IBS and diverticular disease plus some other health conditions. I am concerned this pain in serious. Thank you in advance."
Arthritis,"Shoulder pain for 1 year, what should I do?","Last September I started doing some dancing for a bit of fitness. 3 weeks into the weekly sessions I got a sharp stabbing pain radiating through my shoulder from the base of my neck all the way down to the bottom of my rib cage and across. I was seen by a doctor who said I had reactions Frozen shoulder this couldn't of been the case as I have a full range of movement. So I was referred for physio and carried this on for three months with no improvements and re accruing visits to the doctors. By this point I was taking 20 tablets a day including anti depressants as the doctors believed this was the cause. The physio wrote a report back to the doctor explaining that there was no improvment. By this point I had seen 3/4 doctors and I finally was seeing one who was generally concerned and wanting to help. She referred me for blood tests which they found I had a low, but in the normal bracket, levels of b12 and folic acid tablets. They hoped that giving me folic acid tablet supplements would help. These didn't help so I was referred for a neurology appointment which was this morning. From this I will be having an MRI scan however the consultant believes that the reason I am in so much pain is because of my b12 levels. What do I do?

I have diabetes, controlled high blood pressure, diverticulosis, and bilaterial knee osteoarthritis. I've been treated with steroid shots in one knee.

I have to rotate these because one will tend to stop working after a while, so I go on to the next one. Sometimes I have to use a cane.I've been on a low-carb diet for two weeks and have only lost one pound. I am so discouraged. Today I threw in the towel and ate a hamburger. Now I really feel guilty. I'm trying to stay away from sugar and bread. I'm in a panic now because my vacation is coming up at the end of September and I can barely walk. I went shopping today and had to cut it short when my knees started ""catching"" and the pain was too much. I'm wondering if I should get a brace. I have very large legs. From the ones I see on Amazon, I'll have to get a size 6X. What kind should I get? An offloader? Not sure. My pain is on the inside medial part of each knee. Probably from years of pronation or supination? I just bought a really good pair of shoes with orthotics in them but sometimes it's just not enough. Any advise would be appreciated. I know I need to exercise but it sure hurts. I have been to physical therapy but the relief didn't last very long. Probably should still be doing the exercises. I will at least start that.

Which helped me sleep and relieved the pain .I went back to see him and he then let me speak and say I have inflammation and I know this is not associated with fibro.( three months later and Ive decided to leave the medication because I cant take it forever)My symptoms are as follows :1. Stiff in the mornings . Duration seems to be varying . Thats a factor forconfusion for me.2. I have very bad crepitus in my knees and find great discomfort in kneeling , bending to pick things up.3. Every night and only night time My knees swell up as well as my feet as the pictures attached . ( This is not found in my blood tests)4. In the mornings / during the day my feet turn off blue / gray as the first picture presents.5. I have PAIN most of the time in my knees and or ankles.6. I have occasional pains in my wrists.7. I cannot sleep at night because of the pain.8. My joints(Knees , Ankles, Wrists, shoulders) in general are always crackling ( I know this might not be arelative factor but it can be pretty painful at times)all seems very confusing . I am 28years old and used to love gymming . I had to give that up . Simply because when I attempt any form of physical activity , I have tremendous pain and swelling which is especially in my knees.I also just question people who say I should push through the pain and gym anyway it will eventually get better. I just wonder all the time if this is some sort of Degenerative joint disease should I really be preforming these activities ?I would appreciate it if anyone could get back to me with similar symptoms ?Advise ? Any sort of response ? "
Arthritis,Bed Side Manner,"This is a question mostly for the ladies, simply because men and women patients are treated didfferently sometimes. Historically women were often viewed as ""hysterical"" about their health and so weren't taken seriously.I have seen many doctors and on the first visit they're always pleasant and attentive. But as soon as they see my negative blood tests they get very dismissive and won't listen at all. One doctor literally yelled at me when I wanted to discontinue NSAIDS since they weren't working and had to decline PT because I couldn't afford it. They seem to think I'm questioning their medical judgement and start treaing me like a hypochondriac. It's been implied that I'm drug ""shopping"" even when I decline everything, that I'm just depressed, and that drugs don't work because I'm not taking them as prescribed. They get irritated if I ask questions and seem eager to rush me out the door. It is such a shock to see the change in attitude.I'm ever so sorry I have ""perfect"" blood but I still have pain and it's the doctor's job to figure out why, not to assume I'm making it up."
Arthritis,Joint stiffness and pain in fingers. Age 21,"Hi there i've had symptoms of joint stiffness and pain for almost 2 years. It started of as a very subtle stiffness, and now is quite painful. I go to the gym regularly and have lost grip strength as my joints are very painful doing deadlifts. I've also noticed a bony growth on 1 of my PIP joints. I have seen the doctor and all my blood tests were fine, and I have no other symptoms. The doctors seem to brush this off because i'm quite young. But i'm really worried as i'm very young and don't want to lose function of my hands. i just wanted to get anny suggestions from you guys. I thought about OA but I'm fit and healthy and exercise regulary so I don't know why I would develop it so young.Would appeciate some advice"
Arthritis,Bilateral hip replacement!,Hi! Two weeks ago I had both hips replaced- (bilateral hip replacement) - (anterior approach ) after unsuccessfully trying stem cell therapy a year ago on both hips..I am a professional Choreographer/performer/ dance instructor ....So far I'm progressing well....doing stairs and almost on a cane instead of my walker thanks to GREAT home PT! Something I noticed about my body since the surgery .....My hips feel wider? Is this what happens after bilateral hip replacement? Both of my hips were bone on bone before the surgery. ... I am still swollen and numb on certain parts of my legs...but my hip width is definitely bigger than before? My pants are really tight at the waist........ ( and I have lost a few pounds since the surgery. ) I feel a little bit like my figure has changed. My hips were always smaller than my shoulder width but immediately after the surgery they were wider. Will this go back to the way it was before or do I need to buy new clothes?Thanks!Hi!

Arthritis,Crepitus - why is it not taken seriously?!,"HiI've just searched through the forums to see if anyone has done a discussion about crepitus. It seems not - which is nothing against any contributors or the medical profession, but it does seem to be indicative of the lack of info/concensus about excessive popping/cracking/snapping,Does anyone else present excessive crepitus? As in most joints in the body - especially the elbows, shoulders, wrists, knees, feet and disturbingly for me, the neck, spine and even head! Of all my presenting symptoms, the crepitus is the worse as it pretty much is saying - your skeleton ain't moving properly. Unfortunately it seems there's a contradiction in what it might be trying to say - on one hand, I've read in some areas it's a sign of arthritis, yet the doctors generally tell you not to worry about it if no pain comes with it? It's very confusing!Anyone, not sure I've got a question to ask per se - just interested to see if anyone else suffers from it as much as I do."

Arthritis,Arthritis caused by broken wrist,"My 20-year old son broke his wrist in a cycling accident last month. At A&E the x-ray showed not too bad a fracture, a small chip off the bone. He was put in a cast and told that he would only hear from the virtual fracture clinic if they found anything from the x-ray. He then heard nothing. A couple of weeks later our sharp-eyed postman belatedly brought us some letters addressed to the wrong number in our street by the hospital. One included notification of a now-missed appointment. My son rang and was given a new appointment two weeks later. A new x-ray was taken and a new cast put on. Another routine appointment then came through, at which today he was x-rayed and they took the second cast off but didn't replace it. The doctor said the latest x-ray showed that because of the delay caused by the misaddressed letter, the fracture had healed just under a millimetre out of alignment. and this could mean he would get arthritis in 10-15 years, ""but don't worry"". My son is very worried. What is the actual likelihood? Are there any preventative steps that could be taken?My 20-year old son broke his wrist in a cycling accident last month.

Arthritis,Inflamed colon and use of NSAIDs,"I have polyarthritis and fibromyalgia for which I take ibuprofen. The last few months ive had to up this due to life changes which have stressed my body more - moving house. A pain which was intermittent in my colon area became constant and acute. I had a virtual colonoscopy which revealed diverticulitis but the pain hasnt gone away. I realise that what has changed since moving is my increased dosage and also less water intake as my routines have all changed. Im wondering whether anyone else has noticed that ibuprofen long term inflames their colon? Ive gone cold turkey on the ibuprofen and am drinking more water and had a change of drugs at least temporarily which seems to be helping slightly. My GP didnt think this would be a cause when I asked her, but I am not so sure. Experiences welcomed!"
Arthritis,Wonderful Arthritis Cream that works!,"Hello everyone. Have you arthritis pain in one or all of your joints, relax I have found a wonderful cream. I have arthritis in both knees, and am waiting for the first knee replacement surgery. On line I found creams that are based on CELADRIN which works amazingly on myself. It lubricates the bones that are rubbing together that causes intense pain. I apply a generous amount and rub into my knees every morning as soon as I get up. Rub in well so that there is no residue which will soak into your clothes. Takes a few minutes. I have wonderful relief for the whole day, often finding one application works well and I am pain free. There is a good one on Amazon, in a white tub with a blue and yellow label on it, which says Celadrin Ultra (initial S.......). Good Luck. Give it a try it works wonders and the effect gets better when used every day."
Arthritis,Feeling Crippled and In Constant Pain,"This is a rather long story but I hope someone can supply some feedback or has had a similar experience. I am not young by any means but I look years younger than my age and have a positive attitude. I have been dealing with some GI problems, but haven't found them nearly as debilitating as what happened to me starting in the beginning of April. One day I woke up feeling a bit strange, like I had a touch of some bug. Regardless, I did my errands even though feeling very tired. My entire body ached and for days I noticed I had barely any energy. I decided to see my doctor, who did a blood profile, concluding that everything looked more or less normal. Gradually, I got some strength back but my body still ached in a weird way. A few days prior to May 8, my spine became so painful that it felt like my back was broken. All the ribs on the right side hurt and so did my right leg, from the toes to the hip joint. On May 8 I went to Urgent Care, as I could not move or walk without extreme pain. I knew my back was not actually broken, but was tired of wondering what was going on.?Several x-rays were taken of the spine and I was given pain medication. I quote from the report: ""1. Mild multilevel degenerative disc changes. 2. Moderate degenerative facet changes, greatest at L4-5 and L5-S1.""?That is not so bad in writing but my back and leg still hurt like the devil today, May 13. No change at all. As far as the leg is concerned, I think I might have a pinched nerve, The radiologist's report also stated that my spine curved slightly to the right. Yes, ""mild"", ""slightly"", ""moderate"" but, if it's no big deal, why am I in chronic severe pain all of the time now? I feel best while lying on my stomach and it's a good thing I sleep that way so at least I can get a few hours of rest during the night. It also helps me to lie in a hot bath, which, of course, I now have trouble entering and exiting due to general stiffness. I feel like I've suddenly become an old woman of 90. Any thoughts would be much appreciated."

Arthritis,my grandfather is 71 and has horrible back problems,"Hi, my grandfather is 71 years old and has arthritis in his lower back. He has recently had 3 steroid injections which were weeks apart. He has also had other injections in the past I beleive and has taken some scary strong drugs to help with his back pain. Sometimes they help him and other times nothing. His back is still killing him. He moves very slowly throughout the day. Sometimes just certain movements make him hurt. Even sitting can be painful or turning while sitting. He tries to stay active by doing chores around the house and in the yard like most elderly people. He is retired and lives off his pension. I worry about him though. I do not know the exact details of his problems but the doctor said that surgery was not necessary. He is however doing horrible on a day to day basis and his back always hurts. Even laying on his side in bed, getting on the bed sometimes results in him screaming in pain very loudly. Is this normal for arthritis? I fear he will get worse or immobile completely as he ages. Should I be worried about it? Thank you for any help and I wish you well!"

Kept up with family all the way but suffered from terrible pain, especially in left knee. To the point where it become swollen, with pockets of fluid. Went to GP when I returned home and was given stronger pain killers and sent for X-ray. GP said she thought it would be cartilage and would a operation. Swelling has gone down a bit but had to come off Naploxin (improfen based medication) as my stomach was really sore and upset. So back to square one as far as pain is concerned.

Arthritis,Capable of work apparently ,"Hi all. I had my left hip replaced 6 months ago due to osthio arthritis.

How can I work when I have this pain, plus I need physio and have to wait for an appointment with the hospital for an injection in my spine. Has anyone else experienced this? Cheers Jules. "

Arthritis,Mystery disease-Very Painful-Over 2 years-Need Help!,"Long story short- I have pain in my legs, hips, shoulders, back, arms, knees, wrists. Extreme fatigue and weakness. Shortness of breath and new unusual heart palpitations. This all started in my right leg and ankle and moved it's way up to my shoulder and then eventually to the left side of my body. First I limped, then I got a cane, then a walker and fear a wheelchair will be next. This all started when I was 28 years old. I am now 30 years old. I've had thyroid and reheumatoid arthritis ruled out from a specialist. They have found some impingements and nerve damage on my left shoulder, hip, and elbow. I never had any accidents. No reason to wake up with all of this one day: MRI showed lesions and perpendicular white matter on my brain. 1st neurologist did spinal tap and the test that electrocutes your muscles and shoves needles in your muscles and moves them around. Anyways they didn't see anything of great significance through any of them. The last thing my new neurologist has said was the lesions could be from mild MS or from anything... I could have been born with them. I've experienced weight loss, naseau, and intense brain fog. Ex. I'm looking at the orange juice and in thinking orange juice... then lemonade comes out for no unferstanfable reason. Sometimes I just forget how to text or type. Sometimes I will tell someone the same story 3 times and have no recollection telling them once. This scares me a lot but what's going on with my body scares me more. My doctor has ran tons of tests. I've done everything they've asked me too and still am nowhere near an answer. I am a single mom with 2 children. I work full time and I can't take days off when I feel terrible or my arms and legs don't want to work. I don't have that luxury. My kids see me scream in pain when I try to lift up my arms or take steps. I try to hide it's much as I can but is nearly impossible. They deserve to have a healthy mom who can have fun, laugh, and take them to the park. Physically getting worse is taking an enormous mental tole I me now as well. I've tried to be hopeful but after several years it's hard to stay positive. Not getting any answers and doctors trying to shove anti depressants down my throats is starting to make me depressed. What's aggravating is that they make me feel like I'm a depressed person and that the depression is causing these symptoms. I never had depression before this. All my life. Check my history! Everything that's happening to me physically is starting to make me depressed. If I didn't have children, and they couldn't figure this out. I'd be gone. Because being in so much pain and physically disabled out of nowhere is too much to deal with sometimes. I have the two sweetest, kindest kids in the entire world and would never leave them behind. Which is why I need some ideas and help to point me in the right direction to get better! Mayo Clinic called me for an appointment but they don't take my insurance and I don't have 6 grand for the initial appointment and routine testing. Plus if they don't figure it out with that, than you have to come up with more money up front to continue.I am so desperate to fix this. Please.

I'm looking at the orange juice and in thinking orange juice... then lemonade comes out for no unferstanfable reason. Sometimes I just forget how to text or type. Sometimes I will tell someone the same story 3 times and have no recollection telling them once. This scares me a lot but what's going on with my body scares me more. My doctor has ran tons of tests. I've done everything they've asked me too and still am nowhere near an answer. I am a single mom with 2 children. I work full time and I can't take days off when I feel terrible or my arms and legs don't want to work. I don't have that luxury. My kids see me scream in pain when I try to lift up my arms or take steps. I try to hide it's much as I can but is nearly impossible. They deserve to have a healthy mom who can have fun, laugh, and take them to the park. Physically getting worse is taking an enormous mental tole I me now as well. I've tried to be hopeful but after several years it's hard to stay positive. Not getting any answers and doctors trying to shove anti depressants down my throats is starting to make me depressed. What's aggravating is that they make me feel like I'm a depressed person and that the depression is causing these symptoms. I never had depression before this. All my life. Check my history! Everything that's happening to me physically is starting to make me depressed. If I didn't have children, and they couldn't figure this out. I'd be gone. Because being in so much pain and physically disabled out of nowhere is too much to deal with sometimes. I have the two sweetest, kindest kids in the entire world and would never leave them behind. Which is why I need some ideas and help to point me in the right direction to get better! Mayo Clinic called me for an appointment but they don't take my insurance and I don't have 6 grand for the initial appointment and routine testing. Plus if they don't figure it out with that, than you have to come up with more money up front to continue.I am so desperate to fix this. Please. Anybody?"

Arthritis,"10 years of Blood Tests, CFS and Fibromyalgia, Confused.","Hello,just want some advice on the next set of blood tests I should be asking my Doctor about, as been going round in circles for over 5 years now. I'm UK based.I have been diagnosed with M.E. (CFS) for 15 years, Fibromyalgia for 6 years and supposedly Rheumatoid Arthritis for 4 years.Latest Results:Plasma Viscosity: 1.91White Blood Cell: 11.3Hemoglobin: 11.4CRP: 25Platelets: 4.51Neutropenia?? (Neutrophils) Neutra Something: 8.18Glucose: 10I've had the standard two blood tests for Lupus, they came back negative. My hands get swollen and my Rheumatologist thinks RA and Gout (crystals in the blood tests), so have been on Sulfinpyrazone and Hydroxychloroquine for a number of years. But stopped taking the pills for this latest blood test and found that they were not actually doing anything. My Doctor is stumped. Had Thyroid checks, Celiac disease and most of the standard blood checks.Inflammation indicator is too high but doesn't pinpoint what is causing the inflammation. What should I be doing more or investigating?Thank you for any advance."

Arthritis,Bodywide cracking,"Hi all,I'm very concerned, I've had bodywide cracking of my joints which has gotten progressively worse over the last couple of years. My physio wanted me to be tested for RA. I had some tests done although they missed out RF for some reason and instead looked for inflammatory markers - negative.My wrists, elbows, knees and ankles seem to be the worst offenders. There is also sometimes pain assosciated with the cracking too, which is what got me worried. Often there will be a sense of tightness and uncomfort in the joint, then this loud cracking will solve that issue.Every time I do a press up, my elbow and shoulder clicks, every single time.If I crack my knee like a normal person would which pops the nitrogen bubbles etc, I can do it again within 1-2 minutes of the intial pop, whereas I read a normal person would have to wait 20 minutes atleast.I'd really like to find an answer and wondered if anyone had similar issues and got to the bottom of it? Im trying to progress in life but I can't as I'm worried I'm falling apart. I'm only 24.Many thanks for any help."

Arthritis,Supercool deep freeze muscle spray best relief,"Hi, I am new to this section of the forum but have suffered muscle and joint pain for several years, and I find great comfort from a product and would like to share with you.Firstly what I always found with deep heat and similar ""heating"" remedies, was that it made my skin feel itchy and uncomfortable, and then I tried deep freeze supercool sprays in the blue and white cans available originally from Wilkinsons.I found the cooling spray made me feel so much better, it relaxed the muscles, it cooled as well as healing and I'm also a sufferer with high blood pressure so it doubled up to help me get some relief from that as well, and I actually feel after a good spray, mainly on my legs but also back, neck shoulders, even arms, quite delirious and overwhelmingly relieved.I don't know if it would work for you but for me its the only thing that does, so if you think it might, I can tell you the best place to get it from is Weldricks pharmacy, as Wilks no longer do it and from Weldricks it is only £1 a can plus two or three quid for shipping on top, so a bargain especially if you get through a lot as I do.So anyway, just thought I'd share. Be warned though, do not get the smaller pale blue cans as they are more expensive and I have not found them so effective nor last as long, best wishes, Fiona"

Arthritis,Chronic joint pain and gabapentin,"Thousands and thousands of people suffer chronic pain, and I am one of and them the nhs doesn't seem to have the facilities to help us. I damaged my back as a teenager and although I managed to train as a professional ballet dancer was forced to retire at age 25.Since then the backache has got worse and been joined by shoulder pain and ankle pain and now knee pain - also my fingers are swollen at every joint making them look like a witch's.My GP prescribed nsaids, co-proxamol then co-codamol, tramadol, and now gabapentin. He refuses to send me for an mri scan but xrays have only shown normal 'wear and tear' damage (I am 74).I think the problem is that I'm so used to putting on a cheerful face for the world no-one takes me seriously, although the pain reduces me to crying and I know I'm not a nice person in the privacy of home - all due to pain.Gabapentin (only 300mls so far) has proved quite effective although the side effects are worrying. I am in 'la la land' and forget words and names, its like walking around in a haze - completely spaced out. The biggest problem for me though is I have gained 10lbs weight in a month although my appetite is non-existent. This cannot continue as I was quite portly anyhow due to beng so inactive.Has anyone has similar experiences, and does anyone have any helpful suggestions?"

Arthritis,"Vague arthritis diagnosis - frustrated, scared and confused","Hi everyone,I got a diagnosis today from a rheumatologist of ""a rheumatoid variant arthritis."" I'm a 38 year old female with a history of pain: daily pain in my thorasic spine, occasional flare ups in low back, right hip, and right shoulder. Pain goes back to my late teens/mid 20s. I tested negative for RA and lupus, and negative for the ankylosing spondylitis gene. C reactive protein was high, though. Low back mri showed some bone changes but nothing suggesting ankylosing spondylitis.He said that I should think of myself as ""basically healthy, but with some kind of inflammatory disease."" He said to take NSAIDS to treat it when it flares up, and that I can continue doing physical therapy and chiropractic, but unless the pain gets to the point that I can't control it with over the counter stuff, I can just go about living my life and not worry about it. I'm having what you might call ""all the feelings"" about this. He looked at some decade-old mri and CT reports and really felt that they indicated the inflammatory disease. Why didn't my primary doc or my orthopedist say anything about that 10 years ago? Were they wrong, or is he? This is basically a non-diagnosis diagnosis, so it just feels really amorphous and like it's just his opinion. Everyone else was saying that I just have biomechanical issues, but he says all my joint pain is related to this. But then why did no one see anything other than normal degenerative changes on my thorasic mri a few months ago, when that has hurt every day for 15 years?I'm just sad and angry and frustrated and confused and then angry again and then crying again. I'm trying to remember that it's not that bad a diagnosis - he said this rarely causes disability in females and I don't need to limit my activities in any way. So why am I so upset????I guess I'm just looking for some people who can understand how crazy-making this is, and maybe reassure me that even if this is a form of arthritis, it's going to be okay. Also, I'm going to ask my primary to suggest a rheumatologist for a secondition opinion...any specific questions you would suggest I ask?Thanks.Beth"
Arthritis," Medications. What helps, What dont?","I am wondering for any others who have been diagnosed with arthritis what medications you were prescribed and whether you found them helpful or not? I was initially diagnosed with Spinal Arthritis back in 2012 for which I was prescribed Arthrotec for it. In the beginning I will say it did help me so I can go about my day. Over time pain gradually became worse. In April of this year during a 2 week hospital stay ( Had no mobility (severe pain. couldnt sit, stand, walk) and at first they though I broke my hip. During my hospital stay and extensive testing (mri, xrays, ct scans) I was diagnosed further with Scoliosis and DDD. Since then I've been on Morphine, Dilaudid, Naproxen, Tylenlol 3, also Baclofen. To this date I must say I havent had much success with any of these medications really helping to manage my pain. Does anybody know of any other medication I can discuss with my doctor that may bring me relief? I get such severe pain right now that is so bad I can only walk maybe 1 block before it causes me to double over. At this point in time I cant even shower unassisted. I just want some type of relief even if its just a few hours at a time.OTC Medications Ive triedTylenol ArthritisIbuprofenTylenol w/ CodeineRobax Platnium"

I visited my gp a couple of days ago as I can't sleep for the pain. She just told me it was wear and tear and gave me painkillers and sent me for a blood test for rheumotoid arthritis (my grandma had it) but said she didn't expect it to come back positive. I'm not sure what's going on, I've got burning muscle pain around the hip joints, I can't lift anything heavy as my elbows hurt so much. My ankles throb constantly even in bed, I used ot look forward to going to bed to 'rest' but now it's just as uncomfortable being in bed and I'm not resting. It doesn't feel like normal 'wear and tear' as the gp said. I'm exhausted and although I'm still working, as I have no choice, my life is affected by this pain. I don't know if this is related to menopause, arthritis or something else but it's making my life a misery. I asked the gp for x-rays but she refused saying that it's too difficult as it's multiple joints that are affected. I feel like I'm being fobbed off, and the painkillers don't ease it whatsoever.Mandy."

I was just wondering if anyone has any advice as i'm just generally feeling fed up and down along with the pain as I was meant to go to university this year but now have to defer while all my friends are getting ready to go and going out and doing things during the summer I've been order to stay in hospital for 2 weeks and then mostly bed rest for 8 more, and because i'm so young when people first see me with my walking stick and splints I then need to explain it all to them and I feel like i'm being babied a lot and I know it's just them being helpful but i'm finding it really difficult to adapt to this being my new normal, also most of my friends have been great and coming to see me but a few of them just don't understand that for now I find it difficult to go out and do what I used to and for some reason get annoyed st me or act like this is no big deal and it's just all quite a lot to cope with "
Arthritis,21 Year Old with Joint Pain,"I'm a 21 year old female and I've been having joint pain for about the past 2-3 years but it recently started getting worse & affecting more joints. Most of my joint pain is in my knees but it recently started in my shoulders, feet, and hands. The pain is the worst ache I've ever experienced and it happens both when I'm up and moving and also when I'm sitting or lying down. I've been putting off going to the doctor because I've mentioned it before to my doctor and she just kind of blew it off (because of my age) but it's gotten so painful lately that I feel like I need to figure something out now. I don't have any swelling or redness in my joints, just a severe aching pain. I am on omeprozole for GERD and I also have the impalanon birth control in my arm (not sure if that's relevant).I'm a 21 year old female and I've been having joint pain for about the past 2-3 years but it recently started getting worse & affecting more joints.

Arthritis,Bilateral ankle pain/swelling diagnosed as gout. Responding well to Prednisone. Doubtful of diagnosi,"Current meds: Metropolol Succinate XL, Fluoxetine, Amlodipine (Norvasc). Was prescribed Wellbutrin XL on 2.8.2016 and took that up until 3.28.2016 when my prescription was discontinued.A little over three weeks ago (3.13.2016) I woke up with pain and swelling in my ankles as well as pain in the heels of both feet. After two days of the pain worsening I went to the ER (3.15.2016) where, upon a visual inspection, the doctor diagnosed it as cellulitis and prescribed antibiotics. Two days later, the pain persisted so I visited my family doctor where I was prescribed Prednisone and had blood labs performed (3.17.2016). I took the Prednisone that day and by the next morning I could walk again. The pain and swelling had disappeared completely.The tests that were performed were:Uric Acid (6.8 mg/dL)Lyme (Negative)Rheumatoid Factor (11 IU/mL)Sedimentation Rate (42 mm/hour)Compr Metab PanelCBC/Diff – with flags for for the following components: (WBC: 11.83 K/uL; MPV: 11.8 fL; SEGS: 76%; LYMPHS: 12%; ABS. SEGS: 8.96 K/uL)The Prednisone was a tapered 10-day dosage, and on the day of my last dose (3.26.2016) the pain began to return and was even worse than it was before. On 3.28.2016 I went to the ER and was admitted for testing and observation.While in the hospital (3/28/2016), in addition to ultrasounds for DVT/blood clots (negative), they ran another series of blood labs:Uric Acid (6.7 mg/dL)CRP, Low Sensitivity (18 mg/L)Rheumatoid Factor (11 IU/mL)Sedimentation Rate (24 mm/hour)Compr Metab PanelCBC/Diff – with flags for for the following components: (WBC: 12.25 K/uL; SEGS: 80%; LYMPHS: 10%; ABS. SEGS: 9.76 K/uL)25-Hydroxy Vitamin D (16 ng/mL)Complement C3 (185 mg/dL)Complement C4 (32 mg/dL)ANA (Negative)CCP IGG AB (<16 units)that night they gave me more prednisone and when i woke up the next morning the pain and swelling were gone and i could walk again. they ran another battery of labs that day, with slight changes in the cbc/diff. i was also visited by a rheumatologist who diagnosed the whole thing as gout and gave me a 20-day tapered dosage of prednisone and then discharged me. the results of the labs from the day i was discharged (3.29.2016) were:hepatitis c antibody (negative)hep b surface antigen (negative)cbc/diff – with flags for for the following components: (wbc: 11.90 k/ul; segs: 87%; lymphs: 9%; abs. segs: 10.35 k/ul)for the first 5 days i was out, i was taking 20mgs of prednisone per day and everything has been fine. the last two days i have been taking 15mgs of prednisone. the problem is that last night i experienced some minor swelling and this morning there is a little swelling as well some pain. my fear is that once i taper off the prednisone the whole thing is going to become awful again and i will spend more time in the er/hospital with no one being able to figure out what is actually wrong with me. what else should i be telling them to test for? what are they missing? can this really only be gout? the doctors i met with all seemed a bit perplexed by the whole thing so the final diagnosis was not exactly reassuring. units)="""" that="""" night="""" they="""" gave="""" me="""" more="""" prednisone="""" and="""" when="""" i="""" woke="""" up="""" the="""" next="""" morning="""" the="""" pain="""" and="""" swelling="""" were="""" gone="""" and="""" i="""" could="""" walk="""" again.="""" they="""" ran="""" another="""" battery="""" of="""" labs="""" that="""" day,="""" with="""" slight="""" changes="""" in="""" the="""" cbc/diff.="""" i="""" was="""" also="""" visited="""" by="""" a="""" rheumatologist="""" who="""" diagnosed="""" the="""" whole="""" thing="""" as="""" gout="""" and="""" gave="""" me="""" a="""" 20-day="""" tapered="""" dosage="""" of="""" prednisone="""" and="""" then="""" discharged="""" me.="""" the="""" results="""" of="""" the="""" labs="""" from="""" the="""" day="""" i="""" was="""" discharged="""" (3.29.2016)="""" were:="""" hepatitis="""" c="""" antibody="""" (negative)="""" hep="""" b="""" surface="""" antigen="""" (negative)="""" cbc/diff="""" –="""" with="""" flags="""" for="""" for="""" the="""" following="""" components:="""" (wbc:="""" 11.90="""" k/ul;="""" segs:="""" 87%;="""" lymphs:="""" 9%;="""" abs.="""" segs:="""" 10.35="""" k/ul)="""" for="""" the="""" first="""" 5="""" days="""" i="""" was="""" out,="""" i="""" was="""" taking="""" 20mgs="""" of="""" prednisone="""" per="""" day="""" and="""" everything="""" has="""" been="""" fine.="""" the="""" last="""" two="""" days="""" i="""" have="""" been="""" taking="""" 15mgs="""" of="""" prednisone.="""" the="""" problem="""" is="""" that="""" last="""" night="""" i="""" experienced="""" some="""" minor="""" swelling="""" and="""" this="""" morning="""" there="""" is="""" a="""" little="""" swelling="""" as="""" well="""" some="""" pain.="""" my="""" fear="""" is="""" that="""" once="""" i="""" taper="""" off="""" the="""" prednisone="""" the="""" whole="""" thing="""" is="""" going="""" to="""" become="""" awful="""" again="""" and="""" i="""" will="""" spend="""" more="""" time="""" in="""" the="""" er/hospital="""" with="""" no="""" one="""" being="""" able="""" to="""" figure="""" out="""" what="""" is="""" actually="""" wrong="""" with="""" me.="""" what="""" else="""" should="""" i="""" be="""" telling="""" them="""" to="""" test="""" for?="""" what="""" are="""" they="""" missing?="""" can="""" this="""" really="""" only="""" be="""" gout?="""" the="""" doctors="""" i="""" met="""" with="""" all="""" seemed="""" a="""" bit="""" perplexed="""" by="""" the="""" whole="""" thing="""" so="""" the="""" final="""" diagnosis="""" was="""" not="""" exactly="""">that night they gave me more prednisone and when i woke up the next morning the pain and swelling were gone and i could walk again. they ran another battery of labs that day, with slight changes in the cbc/diff. i was also visited by a rheumatologist who diagnosed the whole thing as gout and gave me a 20-day tapered dosage of prednisone and then discharged me. the results of the labs from the day i was discharged (3.29.2016) were:hepatitis c antibody (negative)hep b surface antigen (negative)cbc/diff – with flags for for the following components: (wbc: 11.90 k/ul; segs: 87%; lymphs: 9%; abs. segs: 10.35 k/ul)for the first 5 days i was out, i was taking 20mgs of prednisone per day and everything has been fine. the last two days i have been taking 15mgs of prednisone. the problem is that last night i experienced some minor swelling and this morning there is a little swelling as well some pain. my fear is that once i taper off the prednisone the whole thing is going to become awful again and i will spend more time in the er/hospital with no one being able to figure out what is actually wrong with me. what else should i be telling them to test for?

Arthritis,"Pains in knee and foot, unexplained","Hi, I haven't posted in this section of the patients forum before, but having turned 56, I find I am getting unexplained pains in my legs particularly in the mornings so that it is very painful to walk and I hobble to the bathroom usually.One pain is in the knee joint and the other on the heel and travelling up the leg, I don't want to bother my doctor who has enough to see me about anyway, with other complaints so a lot on his plate so I thought I'd try some high strength glucosomine from Holland & Barrett.On my 55th, around then I recall I had such bad pains in my arm that it was difficult to pick up my average size handbag but glucosomine cured it, remembering to get the high strength as thats the most effective, although more expensive I figure its worth it, but does anyone have any othter suggestions?If after six weeks of the glucosomine I am still experiencing the pain, I will naturally ask my GP if I can have it X rayed but am aware that they do not always show up whatever is wrong, well, going by various tests I've had for other things and what my sister said about her recent knee pain.Anyway, suggestions welcome, with best wishes."

Arthritis,How long does Prednisone stay in your system?,"Hi everyone,When I was about 19 years old, I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. I am now 32 to years old. At least once a year (though more recenly), I would get flare ups in my knees. I started taking Prednisone tablets prescribed by my doctor. I am taking 4 1mg tabs a day. They last about 12 hours, then i have to take them again the next day.I have to go for some blood tests for work, and want to know how long does it take for such a low dose of prednisone to get out of your system? And will it show up on blood tests? My boss knows about my condition, and I listed my medication on the physical exam paper, so she knows. I am just concerned. I don't want it to affect anything regarding my job. What are the odds it will show up in the blood work? "
Arthritis,Just turned 50 and waking up to sore knuckles,"After just turning 50, I am noticing some changes. First of all, back in my younger days I used to hit a heavy bag quite a lot and stopped, then restarted but haven't for over two years. Lately, I have been waking up and my hands feel quite tight in the knuckle area. I don't think the heavy bag was the issue since I did not punch the bag as much with my left hand, however both hands feel the same. I have also had some pain in my feet. Sharp pains mostly on the sole area beneath the toes. My last blood test said my glucose was a tad high but my Doctor did not seem worried. i have taken RX fish oil for over a year.

Arthritis,Major Joint issues and Rhumatologist dismissed,"I'm posting for my husband. He is 40. He has had major joint issues for about 10 years. I have pressured him into going to the doctors many times. The first doctor many years ago wanted to do exploratory knee surgery, even though the pain comes in all different joints. Last year all his fingers in his hands were swollen and he couldn't bend them. I went to his primary with him and she referred is to a Rhumatologist who has great reviews on all the medical review sites. I went to that appointment too. He reviewed my husbands recent blood tests and ordered some more and told him that he couldn't help him. He said it's not arthritis. I then asked him what other type of Doctor we could see to possibly diagnose what is going on with him and he said that he is the end of the line. My husband shoveled the driveway on Monday night. It was really heavy wet snow. His right leg hurt on Tuesday. He was limping on Wednesday. And now it's Thursday and he can barely walk on it. It's his ankle and knee. It was al pay impossible for him to put his pants on this morning. Anyone have any suggestions of where we should go from here?"
Arthritis,Arthritis?,"I've experienced pain in my wrist/hand since November 2015 to the point where I can't use my wrist without the use of a splint. The pain is exacerbated by movement and using the hand and often when I'm not using it. I get no numbness or tingling (this did occur when I initially started to get symptoms) Despite using the splint, I have pain when my hand is knocked against something also. I fractured my wrist in 1997, the consultant feels this may have a negative impact as one of the bones in my arm is shorter than the other. He also thinks I could have Rheumatoid Arthritis which would explain the swelling on my hand. I've had an Emg/nerve conduction test which came back clear. I've been booked on for blood tests to rule out RA and MRI arthrogram is booked for 07/04/16.Does anyone have any suggestions as to what the pain may be caused by? CTS and de Quvervains tenosynovitis have been ruled out. My current job is in administration and very repetitive thus one would assume that OA would be the diagnosis.

Arthritis,Joint replacement's,"Last month I had my 12th joint replacement, I've had 6 total hips 5 on left 1 on the right, 3 total knee replacements 2 on the left 1 on the right, 3 shoulders all on the right, I had 2 total shoulder replacement's but due to my rotator cuff being completely gone and pain they switched my regular shoulder replacement to a reverse shoulder replacement. Then in December 2015 I had spinal fusion I had to have disc removed and 3 vertebrae fused together. I've had 3 hip infection's MRSA. I'm 55 year's old and I'm so tired of all the surgery and problems that I've been having with my body I know I caused most of the problems I've had I worked as a logged and really beat up my body, I've also had 2 broken necks it hasn't been all my bones I've had a brain tumor and I have had 20 heart procedures and also I currently have a aortic aneurysm can anyone else here relate to the kind of problem's I've had and have, I still have faith that I'll be pain free, I'm able to do almost anything I want to except run, I have a torn quadricep tendon that I'm going to have surgery on in 3 weeks. I hope that will be the end of surgery. I've had 95% of my health issues taken care of at the Mayo clinic in Rochester Minnesota. If you Google Mayo clinic Mark Pearce you can see me in a video Mayo did about me when they did the video I was at 8 joint replacement. 4 more since then. Thank you, God bless. Mark"
Arthritis,Hate Pain,"I found out I have arthritis in one foot, and went to the surgeon I had been seeing for treatment. The initial treatment was foot manipulation and injections. The injections last a mere three weeks of comfort and so after my trip to the states I went to him for a follow-up. He examined my foot again by pressing on certain areas to see if they hurt which they did.He did not recommend an operation which fuses the joints together, commenting that with so many bones, liagments, nerves, etc., it might not be wise.So now I'm reduced to going to pain management and physio therapy treatments. Does anyone else have this problem, and if so, how to keep arthritis at bay and not get worse.I imagined I might have this painful ailment at 80 not 60. I'm told walking is beneficial since it circulates the joints, but who wants to cripple walk?This has made a major dent in my whole lifestyle because I used to walk for miles in enjoyment."

I rang on Friday and was told that they were back and the doctor wanted to see me.That particular doc is on holiday now so seeing someone else.Dont know about anyone else but I have had loads of blood tests and they never want to see you afterwards.The fact he wants an appointment makes me wonder have they found something?I'm not overly worried because if they have found something they may be able to do something to help the pain.Anyway the appointment is today so wish me luck.Sorry for the rambleLoveEileen"

Arthritis,arthritis and hip bursitis help,"I have wear and tear arthritis in most joints but at the moment my hips are the biggest problem. Going on for 2 years ago, I developed bursitis in one hip and although have had 2 cortisone injections to ease the pain, it comes back with a vengence. I have trouble sleeping and pain all the time (resting and walking) and whilst I appreciate that I am not as advanced as some and can still get around, it is still affecting my every day life. My doctor says that it's one of those things and I need to get used to it as will 'have it for a long time yet' (being only in my early 50's) I take the maximum dose of nefopam each day as this was the only paid killer that had any effect on the arthritis. My doctor won't do any more injections and suggests rest which hurts and isn't always practical when you work and have a family to look after. I take suppliments each day - glucosamine, cod liver oil and a multi vitamin for women of my age group. Can anyone suggest anything else I can do. I am in the UK (Berkshire)"

Arthritis,Burning joints have spread to most of my joints! Anyone have any idea what's going on with me?,"Hi everyone,28 year old Male here.About 5 weeks ago I started to get a burning sensation in my right elbow, which I didn't think anything of. Over the next few days it spread to my knees and ankles and within the last month it feels as though it's spread to most of the joints in my body. It's worse when I'm not moving, ie, when I start waking in the morning, for the hour before I actually get up I'll toss and turn in my sleep to try and take pressure off of the burning joints, alternating between each side and then my back. It's fairly constant and although activity seems to lessen it, I can feel it in the joints if I put them under any strain (walking for a while I'll feel it in my lower back and knees, typing on a keyboard and my wrists will start to burn, lean forward in my chair and my lower back will flare up, carrying a light bag of shopping and I'll feel it in my elbow/wrist/fingers etc.) The sensation seems to be continuing to spread. in the last few days my neck has started to have a low grade burn and one of my shoulders has now joined in. The severity during the day is similar to a very localised sun burn around each joint, but on waking it feels more like a friction burn in the joint that is under most stress and is quite uncomfortable. My joints have also been clicking a lot lately, which is making me nervous about lots of movement, although the joints only feel a tiny bit more stiff than usual. I haven't seen a doctor about it yet as I've been having some stomach issues for the past 6 months and feel like I've been backwards and forwards to the Dr's office enough lately. Which is why I've been waiting to see how it progresses. As it stands, and I hope I'm not tempting fate, the burning and discomfort is bearable, it just concerns me that it is continuing to spread, despite me not doing anything particularly active. I had a blood test this morning to check my blood count (which won't pick up inflammation and was originally arranged to check up on a low white blood cell count to see if it has returned to normal) I finally gave in after the blood test and booked an appointment, however, the next available appointment at the surgery is 3 weeks today. God bless the NHS.My question is, does anyone have any idea what's going on? And should I be more worried. If I hadn't been to the doctors so much already, I'd have probably already been in to see someone. Like I said, if it wasn't continuing to spread, I wouldn't be as worried, but as the sensation is now in most of my joints and to be honest, is gently increasing in severity, it is starting to concern me quite a bit. I'd love to hear from anyone who has experienced anything similar or who has an idea what it might be? Should I be worried about lupus or RA?"

Arthritis,Any scientific studies correlating weather to arthritis?,"I've read that there is no definitive evidence linking arthritis to climate; only evidence linking arthritis to changes in barometric pressure. I live in Northern California on the ocean: temperate climate, not a lot of dramatic weather changes. My hips, knees and back are in constant pain here. But when I travel to warm climates (doesn't seem to matter whether humid or dry), I have no pain whatsoever. I don't want to take life-long medication or have surgery; should I actually consider moving, even though doctors don't believe there's a scientific benefit to warm weather?"

Arthritis,"Over-zealous Pharmacists, or a legal requirement?","I have been taking Methotrexate for 8 years. Every so often, when I go to my local Chemist for the prescription they want to ""have a word"" about the prescription. It is a complete waste of time, and they have never yet said anything useful. Is it a legal requirement because the drug is toxic, or just my pharmacy being over-zealous. Various appointments waste enough time as it is. Do I have to talk to the Pharmacist or can I refuse?

Arthritis,MULTIPLE JOINT PAIN,"it is amazing how if you smoke, problems are because you do, the same with alcohol and weight. What if none of the above apply and you have symptoms ?? This year in February, I was getting terrible lower back pain and was sent for MRI. I have problem with 5 discs, bulging to the left and pressing on nerve. Soon after this I started getting pain in my neck and up to my head as though I had a stiff neck. If standing up and looking down, terrible pain to lift head back up. In mornings cannot bend head down to even brush teeth. Also hurts to yawn, sneeze and even eat and swallow now. Around about the same time, started feeling like a wet sensation in my knee, it felt like I had knelt in water and my jeans were wet on my knees, but nothing there. Doctor didn't have any ideas. In June my left knee started swelling at the front, I had tight pain in the back of the knee and pain in calf. Very hot and red. Also swelling in left ankle. Sent for DVT scan and found to have fluid in left knee and calf. Cannot walk on this leg properly so most of weight transferring to right leg. Referred to Rheumatology Specialist - appointment not until Oct 21st !!!!Late August my left knee starts to swell. Front and back of knee, calf and ankle. Hot and red and very tight like cramp. DVT clinic again to be safe but again fluid in leg. Cannot stand for long or walk outside the house at the moment now. Need transport to get from A to B. Pain is constant.Now my left wrist and thumb stiff and pain every day .What the hell is going on, symptoms getting worse by the day. Only being prescribed Meloxicam and co-codamol which give me terrible stomach cramps and not very effective for pain. Roll on October when maybe get some answers to what is going on - if they don't cancel the appointment that is !!!"
Arthritis,Steroid injection for suspected RA - what to expect?,"Hello - I'm new on here and wondered if anyone could let me know what I should be expecting from the intramuscular steroid shot I got 2 days ago. I've been going through all sorts of tests for RA over recent months. Nothing has shown up on blood tests or ultrasound, but fingers, elbows, knees, wrists and feet continue to be stiff and painful... not always at the same time. Rheumy says my symptoms do seem to indicate RA, but he's reluctant to put me on DMARDS yet, as no signs of swelling or inflammation. So he gave me a steroid shot on Tuesday, saying it would help within 24-48 hours if there was any undetectable inflammation. If it did help, he'd be happier to start DMARDS in a couple of months time. I think my joints are feeling better. Certainly my feet weren't as excruciating to stand on when I first got out of bed. But I do still feel some stiffness in my joints. Less pain though. Can anyone tell me if this likely to get even better over the next couple of days or is this likely to be the maximum improvement? Of course I'm grateful for ANY improvement, but I'd been expecting to wake up today and feel 100% back to normal. I guess I've a lot to learn!"
Arthritis,Wide spread Osteo arthritis,"Hi I think I may have posted on this subject before. I can't honestly remember as I have been on so many different forums. I suffer from oa in the neck,spine and knees. My knees are the worst. I am 67 years of age and first started having trouble with my knees in my early 40's all be it mild. I have just come back from hospital orthpaedic clinic. This time I saw a different consultant he seemed to think everything was much worst then when I saw my usual consultant 3 months ago. He also thinks it is in my hips although nowhere near as bad as the knees. He said arthroscopy won't work and and will I need knee replacements. I don't think I am quite ready for surgery and also I have other health and family problems to deal with in the next few months. Is there any one in my position. How do you cope and what have you been told. He pointed out that unlike hip replacements that are generally successful. Knee replacements are not a cure and you can still get some pain and 1 in 10 don't work. He said medicine and technology have not advanced as much with knees as with hips. He has signed me off saying I should come back ifI find I can no longer cope with pain etc. He did mention that knee replacements are a really painful op so you need to find your quality of like is unacceptable and you will take the small risk of it not working. This does worry me for other reasons I cannot take painkillers apart from paracetamol. I am not very optimistic for the future. Thanks for reading this. "

Arthritis,Seronegative inflammatory arthritis and methotrexate?,"Hi,I've been suffering with intermittent pain and swelling in the joints of my fingers over the last 5 years. Nothing groundbreaking but odd and I had a fair few visits to the GP because my fingers would stiffen up and be quite sore. This has been say 1-2 bouts (lasting a couple of weeks) in the winter. So nothing major. Last February I had a much worse bout and I would wake in the night from pain in my hand. GP referred me to a rheumatologist who I first met with in August. Well I never have symptoms in the summer so I was totally fine at that appointment and he scheduled the next for December. Come december two of my finger joints had started to swell up and I had the worst bout yet. I was put on Naproxen which didn't remotely stop the swelling in the fingers. They were painful and difficult to bend. This lasted about a month and calmed down just before Christmas. Its now fine but my rheumatologist is talking about putting me on Methotrexate.Well everything I read about methotrexate sounds terrifying and it seems like overkill when I'm only experiencing these bouts in a few fingers (and maybe the odd toe) like twice a year. Everyone I read about who takes it has much worse symptoms.I'm 22 and all x-rays, ultrasounds and bloods come up negative everytime. I have raynauds and get chillblains when its cold too. Just wondering if anyone else has experienced similar difficulties in diagnosis and/or been put on methotrexate for such minor symptoms?"

Arthritis,Role of Vitamin D in aches and pains,i have just heard that low levels of Vitamin D cause aches and pains. Is this true? My husband always feels so much better in the sun - is this because of the sunshine Vitamin D?
Arthritis,One Leg longer than the other??,"For some time, I have had a lot of issues down my right hand side, frozen shoulder, supraspinitus, a collapsing leg, heel spurs and joint pain on the hip and knee.I have just found out that lots of people present at podiatrists with these symptoms - and in many cases, one leg is shorter than the other. What appears to be the case if one leg is shorter your hips cannot be horizontal, in turn your spine cannot be vertical. So what happens? Because the spine is not vertical, it has to bend across the centre and back again to make your back a cork screw. Clearly the spinal cord woudl hardly be able to strecth and contract as it should. In addition, the muscles on the short side have to pull harder to maintain stability. This extra pulling probably causes bone spurs.For some reason GPs and orthopaedic consultants do not consider this possibility or how to treat it.What medical professional should you see to try and sort out this kind of problem? I have heard you can orthopaedic consultants who are biomechanics specialists but they seem to be few and far between."

Arthritis,inflammatory arthritis??,"Any advice would be very appreciated. Last November I went to the doctors feeling generally under the weather and with a painful shoulder when I lifted my arm up, she sent me for an xray and I heard nothing more til January when I received a letter from my surgery saying the hospital had compared my xrays with ones I had in the last 10 years and that I now have 2 areas of erosionn with a motheaten appearance. My blood tests showed a rise in my ESR and she requested repeat bloods and a referral to a rheumatologist. The repeat bloods showed a further rise in ESR and CRP and a low RF and my GP said it could be inflammatory arthritis. When I Googled this it came up with RA. My past history includes heel pain, slipped disk and fatigue. Currently I have hypertension, lymphocytosis, stiff middle finger on my right, heel and balls of my feet are uncomfortable. I am not in severe pain, mostly its an aching feeling going through me and I feel very tired most of the time. Does this sound like RA and what should I ask/expect from my rheumy appointment in March?"

Now I am in constant pain in my lower back, knees, backs of my legs, hands, wrists, hips and occasionally my neck.The pains in my hands wrists and kneed can come and go but I feel they are getting more constant now a days. I am VERY tired all the time my legs and other limbs are completely exhausted I have trouble moving them I have real trouble with stairs and much much more.I have been to the doctors had countless blood tests mri scans physiotherapy I have been referred to a rheumatologist also who I am still seeing and I really hope he can help in some way however nothing solid has been found in any tests that have been done. Blood tests show little abnormalities here and there but nothing that should cause the immense pain I'm in, mri shows a slight bulge in a lower disk however not protruding very far at all and thus not the cause.Does anyone here have any thoughts of been in a similar situation? I am 26 with a young family and I feel I have no quality life anymore.ThanksScott"

Arthritis,NSAIDS and hypertension drugs,"Any others here taking this combination of drugs?I have had knee problems off and on for about seven years. Yesterday my doctor decided that my cartilage has finally 'Gone', probably finished by getting off our local trains where not only do you have to Mind the Gap but have a good two foot step down. He is arranging for another X-Ray prior to discussing my surgical options. Meantime he reluctantly prescribed an NSAID ( Naproxen) after considering my BP and past stomach ulcer and other problems.Reading the packet insert it tells me that Losartan and most hypertensive drugs may be affected by how NSAIDS work.Googling Naproxen + Losartan I read, ""Significant interaction possible (monitoring by your doctor required).losartan oral , naproxen oral . Either increases toxicity of the other by Other mechanism. Combination may reduce kidney function, particularly in elderly or volume depleted individuals.naproxen oral decreases effects of losartan oral by opposing drug effects. Combination may reduce blood pressure reducing effect"""

Arthritis,Osteo arthritis help/advice,"Hi all. I'm looking to find info/advice on how to deal with progressive osteo arthritis. In 2008 I suffered a very bad accident which destroyed all the cartilege in one ankle. This joint developed arthritis and is getting progressively worse due to wear and tear. I have had a subsequent arthroscopy surgery which helped a little. I also had tenosynivitis diagnosed in both thumb joints some 30 years ago but for many years this was self determining and only flared up occasionally. Now both thumb joints are quite severely arthritic also. My GP just advises to take over the counter anti inflammatories, eg voltarol or even ibuprofen but the discomfort is such that even taking the max recommended amount there are days when my hands are agony and I'm unable to do the most basic tasks (eg opening a bottle, holding a cup etc). I experience quite nasty side effects too from anti inflamms, for example stomach upsets and headaches. Does anyone have any suggestions for other ways I might help myself to cope with this condition. Thank you"
Arthritis,My 93 yr old friend success on walking (a lot),"This is a friend I've had for some 5 yrs or so and she will be 93 next week....she still walks around our town and now walks with her cane, but she walks.....she's pretty amazing all in all......Has a bridge group at her apt every thursday for 4 of us ladies and then once a month a group at her place for 8 of us......This is remarkable for a 93 yr old.She has been taking glucosamine/msm combo for MANY YEARS without missing a day. I believe this is saving her.I take higher doses of MSM daily and know it helps pain but probably not doing much for joint rebuilding....I've taken glucosamine off and on for years but mostly off as I don't know that it was doing anything and then I read it COULD raise blood sugar and triglycrides and blood pressure......so that kept me from going gun hoe wth it.....Now I'm back on it and take glucosamine **sulfate as I've read it's the best absorption...I will see my doctor next week for my annual check in and get some bloods done and talk to her aboutglucosamine....my glucose and tris are good, I take a BP med and don't want other health issues "
Arthritis,I'm on Tramadol slow release & have been for a good few years,"I'm a bit worried because if I miss taking it I start getting withdrawal symptoms like flu like feeling and light headed etc.Now as well as these I'm on Gabapentin & Dr in recent letter has stated I suffer from Neuropathic pain, this is true but I also suffer ordinary very real pain due to OA in Spine,Hips etc, They already know I need 2 New Hips but won't put me on list for replacements as I'm too much of a risk. I don't know what to do as I'm spending roughly 5 nights out of 7 in my chair downstairs rather than bed as I can't lay on my side or sleep on my back......Any suggestions?"

Arthritis,misdiagnoses or not,"approx 20 years ago i was diagnosed with arthritis and have been taking arthrotec for all these years as well as being put on other medication as the arthritis was depressing me.approx 16 months ago i found out the only way to diagnose arthritis is to have a blood test.20 years ago i was NOT sent for a blood test,the doctor just took notes of what i said and came up with the conclusion i had arthritis.16 months ago,when i found out this,i went back to the doctor and told him,he sent me for blood tests.when the results came back i asked to see them which he said no.as he was reading the results,he looked very puzzled and when i asked di i have arthritis he replied yes,slight.if 20 years ago i did in fact have arthritis would it not be severe 20 years later and not slight.i do not think now,i have arthritis.what would by taking arthrotec cause damage to me if i do not have arthritis..i am requsting for access to my medical files"

Arthritis,Any thoughts??,"Hi my name is Sam and I am 25. At the end of April I suffered with a severe pain in my lower back. I went straight to the gp, which I rarely do! Had a couple of mris, was unable to bath and dress myself. It effected my legs and bladder and was horrific. Anyways cut a long story short both mris came back ok and that there was nothing wrong. I went to see my gp a month ago after being told this to beg for help. My joints had started to cause me pain and felt poorly and believe it or not my back was starting to ease. She told me she believes me as blood tests have come back and abnormal. She refered me to a rheumatologist said she suspects arthritis, this was a huge shock! At present my back pain is fine, I have constant pain in my feet, hands, ankles and wrists, and on and off pain in my knees hips back neck and jaw. I feel like I have flu, constant fatigue and headaches. I have been unable to work since April. The rheumatologist told me I could have had a back problem to start with which is easing now but triggered arthritis, or it could have been arthritis from the start. But he confirmed arthritis but unsure on type and did further blood tests and gave me a steroid injection. That was two weeks ago. I have not had any relief infact I feel worse and even more swollen. My blood tests which gp done were esr of 37 crp of 38 and rf factor 9. No idea what that means. I have my next appointment with the rheumatologist tomorrow evening, hoping for some relief and diagnosis and should get new blood results. Does anyone have any thoughts? Thanks in advance xx"
Arthritis,THR/Fracture post op,"Hi, I've had osteoarthritis in my lower back, both hips, neck and ankle for about 10- years now.I had my first hip replacement 4 years ago.....successful except for the fact that I have kypho scoliosis {C shaped curve in my spine} and it has gradually got worse so naturally so has my mobility. I know what I have and I can cope with it. Back specialist and hip sp. decided that if my other hip was replaced it MIGHT help my back .So 4 years on from my first one I had my second one......4 weeks post op I was doing one of their exercises....holding a chair and putting one leg out to the side.......CRAACCCKKKK!!!!!!!! I collapsed onto the chair. Husband rang the hospital and they said ring 999. Apparently I've fractured the greater trochanter{sp?} bone beside the replacement.......was in hospital for 3 days, discharged with pain killers and told there was nothing they could do about it It would eventually sort itself out. When...... I don't know...no one seems to tell me. So I'm back on 2 crutches, no driving, cant bend to put shoes on etc.As someone said....its not nice getting old.If I had an idea of timing I would be a lot happier but this ""don't know"" really gets me down......its 4 weeks since that happened and I don't seem to be any better Has anyone else come across this or have any advice..Eileen"

Arthritis,arthritis and giddiness,A friend of mine who has been diagnosed with arthritis on top of scoliosis suffers from a type of giddiness - which was happening before any medication. It isn't really dizzy spells - she describes that she feels she has a heavy weight in her head that pulls her in a specific direction. The feeling is worse if she has to bend down and then get up. Does anyone else with arthritis have a similar problem?
Arthritis,I have knee pain,Can I take tumeric tablets along with naproxen
Arthritis,Re. Widespread arthritis,"Hello, Thanks to everyone who kindly replied to me on this subject. I have an appointment with my Gp next week. I hope she might refer me back to the hospital but that will probably take a few months. I think it was Angie who mentioned that her consultant had said that pain going down leg into calf and foot was referred from the spine. The pain is getting me down, I was up for 3 hours the last 2 nights. I can only take paracetamol and they don't help much. I get some relief from laying on the sofa with hot water bottle on lower back. Great in this warm weather. I might have to try ibuprofen again together with tablet to protect the stomach. I forgot to mention at the weekend I helped my husband put together some new bunk beds for grandchildren when they come downlater this month. I overdid it and am suffering with this same pain fromlower back to foot. I wondered whether or not there might now be someinflammation hence I thought about taking ibuprofen. I will ask gp next week. Last thing has anyone suffered from this type of pain it ranges from a dull ache to toothache like pain. It seems to start lower backgo down thigh bad back of knee (arthritic knee) then worse is the paindown outside of lower leg into ankle and foot. Last time I had this painalthough it was worse I ended up housebound for several months until it suddenly improved on its own. Of course my knees hurt a lot but it is thisother pain that gets me down. Sorry to have gone on a bit, but last timethe hospital did not seem to pay much attention to it and focused on theknees. Take care everyone "
Arthritis,"Severe joint pain in various places, age 21","Hi,For a couple of years now I have been suffering from pain in my wrists, I had previously been to a doctor who said it was probably RSI from my work and prescribed ibuprofen. Over the last couple of months the pain has been getting progressively worse and I now have pains in my elbows, knees and ankles as well. I also find that I sometimes have stiffness in my joints, mainly my hands and fingers and can struggle to grip things. I have been to another doctor since who said that it is unlikely to be arthritis as I am only 21 and none of my family have it and she prescribed some naproxen but this doesn't seem to be helping. I just wondered if anyone else had experienced these symptoms and how you went about getting diagnosed?Thanks,April"

Arthritis,Advice please ,I have just been told by my doctor that I have arthritis in my hands. Can anyone suggest pain relief please? Aabb 
Arthritis,Osteoarthritis and medication,Hello I am in my 60's and have OA in both knees and neck. I am waiting for xray results on my back as I suspect it may be there too. I am in pain every day but manage with just paracetamol. I think I will probably need knee replacements in the near future. My question is does anyone know about the pain post op and what medication is used in the first weeks. I ask this because I cannot take codeine type drugs as they cause stomach cramps and constipation (I have IBS) I also find anyantibiotics do the same. I can take the odd ibuprofen but once again have to be careful because of the IBS and reflux. I am concerned that as pain gets worse and post op there would be nothing Icould use for pain relief. Would be grateful for any info.

Arthritis,Any herbal remedies for Arthritis,"I'm 38 and recently diagnosed as having arthritis, I was wondering if anyone knew of any herbal remedies. My symptoms are a burning sensation/pain down both arms and legs and a pins and needles pain at times across my back between my shoulders. I've pains in my legs and swelling of my ankles as the day goes on. I've swelling of my hands and the pains in my hands can be quite sore. I've had to get my rings enlarged by 2 ring sizes. I've had these symptoms now for 6 mths. As i'll have hopefully many years still ahead of me i don't want to be taking loads of painkillers and anti-inflammatories if there was something else suitable of a more natural means. Is glucosamine any good? They have tested to rule out rheumatoid and thankfully it has come back clear but my inflammation levels are high. Any help would be appreciated. thanks."
Arthritis,Ouch.....Arthritis :-(,"Not a nice condition to have, is it ! Mine was confirmed 6 months ago following a hip/pelvic x-ray, which also showed a trapped nerve, hence the pain. The doctor started me on pain killers (Codeine Sulphate), with no joy. So I went onto Tranadol, with still no joy. Then MST Morphine Sulphate (10mg). No joy again. Now I'm on double the dose. I have only been on them for 2-3 days, but doesn't look very hopeful. Has anyone out there been through a similar regime? Would be very grateful for your comments.Many thanks,Lionel"
Arthritis,Painful shoulder,I have had a very painful shoulder for almost a year. Sometimes it feels swollen although I'm not 100% sure. I eventually went to see my GP when OTC cocodamol didn't work. I had an injection in the joint to no effect so I was prescribed anti inflammatories which gave me severe abdominal pain. Now I take codeine 30 MGM's which helps. My concern is that I have not had a blood test or an Xray nor was I advised to have them.Night time is a difficult time and I often can't sleep for the pain. Does it sound like arthritis?
Arthritis,Seeking alternatives to surgery for knee osteoarthritis.,I am a 66 year old male and injured my knee 12 months ago. An MRI shows a torn menisus and ACL and advanced osteoarthritis. I am still awaiting a surgical consult. There is little pain or stiffness but my knee will no longer support me. I am not overweight but the knee folds backwards when I attempt to walk. Are there alternatives to surgery for joint support? Thanks.
Arthritis,Managing the pain of Rheumatoid Arthritis ," Does anyone have any tips on pain management? I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and have had since 2005. At the moment I take methotrexate by injection and have been since November last year. I have the arthritis in every joint and the pain I experienced recently when I had a bad flare up was unbearable and I could get no relief despite taking Dihydrocodeine and paracetamol. I did get steroid injections in both my shoulders three weeks ago and that has helped but the pain is starting to get me down. I never have a pain free day just different degrees of pain some days worse than others. My consultant is not very approachable nor is she very understanding so I can’t talk to her. When I was first diagnosed I did not think that after all this time I would be in this situation in fact the pain is much worse. I have also tried relaxation tapes but they did work for a short while but not now, I get to agitated to listen to them. Anyone any ideas?"
