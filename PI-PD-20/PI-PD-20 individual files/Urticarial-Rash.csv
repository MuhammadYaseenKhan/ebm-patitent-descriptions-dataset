I totally understand how debilitating it is and how it affects quality of life!I am in South Africa and the cost of consultations for Allergy doctors are super high(partly covered by medical aid here), the cost of Xolair is R10000 each injection (also not covered by medical aid/insurance here) and there are limited information and even lesser support from Doctors. The individual nature of chronic urticaria makes it more difficult to manage as well.I have chronic urticaria for the last 2.5 months and only managed to get it under control for the last week by adding cimetidine 400mg at night (i mainly get them at night).My current treatment regime is as follows:2 x fexo 180mg in the morning2 x xyzal/levocetirizine at night1 x cimetidine 400mg at night1 x montelukast 10 mg at nightI would appreciate any advise on how to wean myself off these high dosages as it is super costly here in SA and the meds always make me super drowsy as well.Is it just trial an error? I am planning to slowly remove for example montelukast this Friday and see the results on Saturday.Then I would like to try swopping fexo for another antihistamine as fexo is the most expensive here (almost 3 x more expensive than the other antihistamines).Thank you. I look forward to hearing from anyone and your time and advise is much much appreciated!!!"

"Urticarial Rash","Chronic Hives","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/chronic-hives-729298","So like many other patients here, I'm having a very hard time coming to terms with the chronic hives Im getting. It's been happening 8 months now. Ive gotten allergy testing and mold testing done in my apt to help rule things out. Ultimately, being diagnosed with CIU. I received my sample Xolair shot last month. No reaction, however hives only got worse (hints the photo below) Ive had every allergy med under the sun (yes even the prescriptions) and nothing works. I have to take 3 benadryl just to make the hives go down (2 does nothing). I generally wake up covered but sometimes it does happen throughout the day. Today, I had my 2nd shot and 2 hours later, my palms and feet got extremely hot, and the hives began to form on my arms. I went back to the allergist and he gave me a steroid and said we cannot be sure if my reaction is to the shot or not as its only the 2nd shot. Now, its a few hours later, Im home and breaking out and my lip is beginning to swell. It's almost like my body rejects everything. I NEVER have any breathing issues ect. but Im beginning to think, maybe this is something more serious? Has anyone had these symptoms in relation to thyroid, liver, lung diseases? Im going to tough it out to the 3rd shot but its becoming so mentally draining that its every single day. image"

"Urticarial Rash","Cure for urticaria","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/cure-for-urticaria-668612","Chinese traditional medicine can cure urticaria. It worked for my 8 year old nephew. He had urticaria for almost 4 months. My nephew took 2 months of Chinese medicine but he is now medication free. The first 2 weeks were terrible because of the Zyrtec withdrawal. His eyes, ears and lips were swollen. He had rashes and itches everywhere. But after 2 weeks it was not so bad. I think he could have been cured in a month if we had followed the Chinese doctor’s diet advice more closely. Now he eats whatever he wants with no problems, knock on wood. He has been medication and rash free only 12 days so far. I’ll let you guys know if it changes. Conventional doctor prescribed him zyrtec. Google search on its safety reveals a lawsuit that says Zyrtec’s withdrawal symptoms are terrible rashes. If my nephew had stayed on Zyrtec, he would probably be fine for a few years and then Zyrtec would fail him and he would have to start taking prednisone. Reading some of the stories on here made me really glad I took him to a Chinese doctor.FYI If anyone is going to try Chinese medicine, try not to take other medicine at the same time. Some of them can interfere with Chinese medicine. I read that one doctor has verified that Zyrtec does. Good luck."

He has booked me in for a blood test on Monday and I have to also provide a urine sample.For those who have experienced this, will a blood test tell me what is causing them? I have never suffered with allergies before and have no idea where to start to try and figure out what has caused it. I haven't changed my washing powder, eaten anything new, etc. etc. so am stumped as to why this is happening.He's told me to take Cetirizine for this which will hopefully help, and I have been putting on Calamine lotion to the worst affected itchy bits to try and calm it down. So far, they have been on my inner arm underneath my armpit, on my hips, wrists and sides of my stomach plus a bit on my legs.Does steroid cream work at all? Any help at all would be so much appreciated, or any tried and tested methods please let me know.Happy to provide photos if needed!Thanks in advance."
"Urticarial Rash","Please help :(","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/please-help--719459","My story begins about 2 months ago. I know from what I've read on here that many people have been living with chronic urticaria for many years and may scoff at the 6 weeks, but I fear I'm just at the beginning of a very long and anxious journey.I went for a routine travel vaccine a month before a trip to South Africa - got Viatim which covers Hep A and Typhoid. Felt a bit poorly afterwards but attributed this mostly to standard post-vaccination immune reaction. 2 weeks later, and with a sore throat developing, I went for the seasonal flu vaccine (I know, I know, apparently I shouldn't have). Within 24 hours I was covered in aggressive hives all over my legs and arms.Doctor took me in and diagnosed me with Strep (? which to this day I can't tell if I truly had or not), and put me on 10 days Abx. I finished the whole course and though my throat felt better, the hives had developed into a coalescent rash.At this point ,doctor prescribed Telfast x1 daily and Eumovate 5% cream. And......... nothing really happened.Back to the doctor a week later and just before trip to South Africa - oral steroids for 10 days and stay on the Telfast. I took all of this during our trip to SA and returned home to find the symptoms hadn't abated. I had agonising chest pain on the flight home which I really want to believe was just my anxiety flaring up, but I'm not convinced. It felt far too severe for that, but thankfully hasn't really happened since.That was 5 days ago and I've been back to the doctor again since. This time, Telfast x1 + Xyzal x3 daily. Not seeing any great improvement, and on top of everything I don't think my body really likes the Xyzal very much. Just don't feel fantastic when I'm on it.The hives seem to get worse with heat changes, and this time of year they're hard to avoid - my wife likes the thermostat a lot, and I find that every single morning without fail when I wake up from a drowsy sleep I am covered in a fresh batch of hives - head to toe now, with the exception of my face and feet.What do I do? I have so much fear that this isn't going to go away. From what I'm reading online, anything longer than 6 weeks is classed as chronic and I understand many of the contributors here will have been dealing with this condition for years.Please tell me there's hope... right now I'm despairing, and can feel my anxiety getting the better of me by the minute.Any and all advice/support appreciated."

Unlike a lot of medical professionals he took down my entire history and listened to me (imagine?). It's not that complicated but as we all know doctors often just get to the exact reason you're sitting there and move you along.He asked if I had low stomach acid. I said not it's high that's why I take prevacid every day for 10 years. He said in reviewing my history he had a hunch that the prevacid had done too much for too long... that my stomach acid was low and that the low stomach acid is causing my hives.What???????!!!!!!!!!!He did a basic baking soda and water stomach acid test.. which revealed excessively low stomach acid levels. OH MY GOD!When the body's stomach acid is low, it panics and creates high histamines to trigger stomach acid production. The high histamines (if combined with already high histamines like in a low carb diet...) can then cause hives since the levels are so high.Can you imagine if this one person has solved the hives reason just by actually listening ??????I emailed my doc asking the best way to wean off the prevacid. I'll keep you all updated.Has anyone ever heard of this? OR could this be something you should consider as well?"

"Urticarial Rash","Have you considered Leaky Gut or Yeast?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/have-you-considered-leaky-gut-or-yeast--690199","I felt it necessary to post because i have read just about every board there is and I know exactly what it feels like to suffer from this intolerable condition. I had chronic idiopathic urticaria for a year. It started out with some itchy palms that would wake me at night. Then it spread to other parts of my body. There were days I had hundreds, maybe thousands. They only thing that would alleviate them was Prednisone but I was determined not to take that for more than a week. I had every blood test in the book. Nothing stopped the itch. I tried anything you can imagine from CBD oil to numbing cream for tattoos. I saw an allergist, two dermatologists, a GP, a cardiologist, an R/A, you name it. Nobody had a clue. They all said it could not be cured - it had to go away on its own. I started keeping a detailed diary. I recommend you do that. I noticed it flared more when I would eat more carbs or have a few drinks. I was virtually hopeless. I started fasting to see how my body would react. I noticed that with no alcohol and less carbs the hives would reduce but not eradicate. I couldn't take it anymore. I could not imagine living like this another 40 years. Then by happenstance during a routine checkup I mentioned to my doctor that they seemed to flare the more I ate and the more I drank. I light went on and he said the common denominator in alcohol and most foods is yeast. He said no physicians would agree with him, that it was a long shot but maybe I had Candida. I had not heard of Candida. I started reading up on it and saw the connection between yeast and leaky gut - the permeability of your GI track that allows microscopic toxic secretions to leak into your body and trigger an immune response. Hmmmm. I'm not overweight. I'm in fairly great shape. How could I have leaky gut. He put me on a two week prescription of Fluconazole (anti-fungal) and I adjusted my diet to no/low yeast - basically gluten free. I cut back on the alcohol substantially and limited my intake to vodka which contains no yeast after distilling. Within days my hives started to reduce in size, color and itch. I literally watched them reduce down to a handful, then one or two. I was then seeing one at night, none during the day. I was basically hive free for the first time in a year. I considered it nothing short of a miracle and believe-you-me i was praying every day for the wisdom to discover the problem. I was a healthy, in shape male. I would never have suspected myself as having a yeast or leaky gut syndrome. I had no symptoms - except hives. Watching them dry up to nothing is probably one of the most exciting moments of my life. If you are reading this and you are desperate, don't give up. You are what you eat. Don't ever forget that. Don't let any doctor tell you you're wrong - consider leaky gut syndrome and consider trying a two week prescription of Fluconazole and a good pro-biotic. Something is causing your immune system to fire off those nasty, red b******s. Figure it out."

Added a steroid and said If I were to have anaphylactic issues it would have already happened. Went to allergist Today. Changed the cocktail to Zantac and Claritin up to 4 times a day (plus steroids). Allergist also said anaphylactic would have already happened. I’ve taken 3 doses today and minimal relief. How long do these meds take to kick in? I have two huge welts on my legs. I think because I wore jeans to my allergist and I could literally feel them heating up.

The next week another one would pop up. The third one I got ended up blistering so that's when I went to a dermatologist. He did 2 skin biopsies and blood work. Both skin biopsies said it was an allergic reaction. The blood test came back negative for autoimmune diseases and my thyroid was fine. I dis find out I'm allergic to wheat, however, it the number barely makes it allergic. The dermatologist eventually told me there was nothing he could do or tell me and told me to take antihistamines. They seem to have gotten worse. Some weeks I get one and other weeks, like this week, I got 7. They are all on my upper arms. Maybe once or twice I had 1 on my foot and 1 on my belly. The only thing high on my blood test was my C Reative Protein. The allergist I seen said she couldn't do anything because the dermatologist did all the blood work and the allergic reaction to wheat is so small she doesn't think it would cause hives.

For years, I've been trying to determine the cause of chronic hives specific to my face, chin and neck. Food elimination diets, allergy shots, product elimination, antihistamines, etc. A few months ago, I finally stumbled upon my cure. I stopped using my electric toothbrush - and have not had hives (at least to the level of severity I was having them) since. I'm convinced.If you have hives, explore this topic. If this post helps one person, I'd be happy. Google Vibratory Urticaria:Those who are suffering from vibratory urticaria avoid lawn mowers, electric toothbrushes, jogging, playing drums, bumpy bus rides, jackhammering, etc. because they have an allergy to vibration. Vibratory urticaria tends to run in families and is caused by a rare genetic mutation that results in an exaggerated cell response to vibrating touch. It may also be an acquired response to a prolonged exposure to vibration. The afflicted report mild to severe allergic symptoms such as welts, fatigue, headaches, and blurry vision. Episodes can occur several times a day.Here's a link but there are many others oout there. Good luck.https://www.verywellhealth.com/vibratory-angioedema-1069424"

It tends to go into remission in the winter but comes back with a vengeance when the weather warms up. The first 2 years it was mostly controllable with fexofenadine and occasional prednisolerone (think that's how you spell it), but this year it is out of control to the point it put me in hospital 2 weeks ago with a tight chest, swelling throat, face, hands and feet. I now have to carry around 2 epi pens. Previously my doctor didn't want to know and had me taking 4x the reccomended dose of fexofenadine saying ""no-one has ever died overdosing on antihistsmines"".Last year I paid for an intolerance test which indicated wheat and dairy along with a few other things. I have since removed them from my diet and my condition improved massively until 2 months ago. I'm now taking 4 piriton a day, 2 ranitidine, 2 fexofenadine and 30mg prednisolerone and it still isn't under control. The doctor is reluctant to give me more of the steroids but at the moment these are the only things that give me somewhat of a normal life. I have been refered for allergy testing but don't hold any hope of them finding anything. 9ne thing I will add is I've been on esomeorazole for acid reflux for 15 years and I do believe these are the cause of my issues. They work by stopping you producing acid but in doing this you do not break down your food properly so you don't absorb vitamins and minerals. Also new research indicates that because you don't break down proteins properly your body's immune system reacts to these proteins and can cause an allergic response. So I am currently trying to wean off these. Also I read on here about Epsom salts and I'd say they are definitely worth a try.

"Urticarial Rash","Chronic Urticaria- suffering for 13 months now","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/chronic-urticaria-suffering-for-13-months-now-560791","In November 2015, I suddenly began feeling itching on my hands, and my feet. I am based in Abu Dhabi, and had just traveled to Lebanon and stayed in a room that was quite dusty. The itching was on and off for a few days and I didn't think much of it. I then traveled to Australia, again staying in a room which was dusty. The itching got worse, and for the first time, red patches with heat and small ""bumps"" in lines started to appear on different parts of my body. I went and saw my GP. I explained my travels, and he diagnosed me with Scabies, and prescribed medication for this. On researching Scabies, I was sure what I had was not scabies, but I completed the treatment. The itching did not stop, and in fact at times became quite intense, but then eased off at random times. I returned to Abu Dhabi, and with the rashes and itching continuing, especially at night, I went to see a dermatologist. He prescribed Telfast 180 antihistamines, which seemed to help control my condition, and asked me monitor my food intake over several days to see if any food item was causing my allergic reaction. Every time I thought I had found the trigger, it seemed to fail with the itching not stopping after days of control and monitoring of foods. The same doctor then suggested that I conduct some allergy tests. I did the first test (blood test) for food items (quite expensive and not covered by insurance, but had to be done as my frustration and itching had become quite intense!). The results came back with everything negative except dairy products. I was somewhat relieved to at least know trigger of my condition, and so I stopped all foods with dairy. Days passed, yet the itching did not stop. At times it actually became worse! The doctor was also confused and suggested I do another allergy test for dust and external factors. The testing place also did a food test again with this dust test. To my amazement and shock, all the results came back negative- including the dairy results, which had come back positive last time. I became more frustrated and the doctor seemed even more confused than before. Meanwhile, my condition continued to progress with severe itching in random and differing parts of my body, the worst place being the soles of my feet and my hands. It was excruciating, and I felt so helpless- at times I would be on the floor like a baby scratching uncontrollably. 4 months had now passed and I went back to the doctor demanding something more. He injected me with a cortisone shot. This actually made my skin break out in a horrible rash on my upper arm which took weeks to heal, but it did slow down the itching for some days. In the meantime I was taking one Telfast a day (at this stage not knowing it was safe for me to take more!!!!). I searched for allergy specialists in the UAE, and finally found one who made monthly visits from overseas. He examined me and after testing my skin for ""staining"" which he called ""dermatographism"", he told me I had an allergic condition known as ""chronic urticaria"", which was the first time I had heard of the name for my condition. He told me to be patient and continue to take antihistamines, but he also recommended I do a prick test. In July I visited Lebanon again and was able to find an experienced immunologist. She was great, and went through my condition in detail explaining that the cause was often never found, and that doing allergy tests was useless in most cases since with chronic urticaria, tests often gave ""false positives"", which explained my dairy findings- a false positive result. It was great hearing detailed information specific to my condition, but quite upsetting when she went through the statistics of the condition- something like 50 % of cases heal within a year, 30% within 5 years, and 20% have it for a life time. Also disturbing was the statistic that in 90% of cases, the cause is never found, while in 10% of cases, the cause can be something internal and often something serious (including cancer!). She told me my treatment would occur in stages. She wanted me to increase my Telfast 180 from 1 tablet to 2, 3 or even 4 tablets per day as long as no symptoms showed. If this dosage did not suppress the condition, she then mentioned other progressive medications, but told me to start with the Telfast for the coming weeks and months in the hope that this settle the mast cells back into a normal state. That was how she explained it. Over the next few weeks, I reached a dosage of 3 Telfasts per day (when I told pharmacists this, they would look at me in disbelief!). By October, I was back down to 2 tablets since for the first time in a long time, I was not feeling any effects of the condition. I was so happy thinking that my body was recovered, or at least almost recovered, and there were days that I actually was living a normal life again and not even thinking about itching or the skins outbreaks.However, it was just 3 weeks ago, that suddenly the rashes, the heat, and the itching returned completely unexpectedly and for no apparent reason since nothing in my life had changed. I was so hopeful that it was just a bad reaction for a day or 2. But with time, it was back with a vengeance- worse than before. I increased my dosage now to 4 tablets, yet the Telfast was now not relieving any of my symptoms- not even 4 tablets a day!!! For the first time I was even feeling tingles and swelling of my lips, and had redness on parts of my body previously not affected. I was completely distressed and went back to my skin doctor since I had no access to my immunologist. He told me that the new outbreak could have been triggered by some antibiotics which I had taken a couple of weeks earlier for a urinary infection. He could see no other reason for the return of the symptoms. However he could not explain why the Telfast was no longer working- I asked for a different antihistamine but he told me it would make no difference and to be patient for a few days to see if my body would settle again. It has now been 10 days, and I can only say that I am suffering badly, especially at night time, when it always seems to be much worse. It became so bad a few days ago that I pleaded with him to give me something else, and he prescribed a cortisone tablet per day- which has actually helped in reducing the itching at most times. But I am told that cortisone tablets are potentially harmful and should only be taken for a short time. He also gave me some lotion which did nothing to help.So here I am, writing in here out of desperation and extreme frustration. I understand that there are people with much worse and with life threatening conditions out there, but I just needed to post this to see what others have done to treat this condition, and whether I should still have hope that my body will actually recover back to the pre-unrticaria stage. Are there any suggestions from anyone who knows about this condition? Please, any advice would be appreciated.The Telfast which was working fine months ago, seems have much less of an effect now. Is it wise to change antihistamine type? Are there better ones, or some specifically better for treating this condition? A friend told me that a friend of his swears by an antihistamine with Levocetirizine 2HCl. Does anyone know if this works well?Sorry for the dramatic detail but I had to release my frustrations in this post in the hope of some good advice from others who have suffered from this or from any medics who might have some information"

As you probably know, when you're having a flare you should eliminate any high histamine foods from your diet - at least for a while. I do hope this helps someone else with chronic hives caused by delayed pressure."

I am taking steroids but 8 x 5 mg for 3 days only to try and get it under control - i have just been in the car for 7 hours to get to my specialist appointment and that has made it go like mad!!!! - has anyone heard of any connections with stomach problems and urticaria - I seem to get bad diarrahoa when i have a bad attack and it all started when i had a sickness and diarrahoa bug in December 2006. Does anyone have a link with periods? I have a lot of periods and have endometriosis and polycystic ovaries and wondered if anyone had the same and had urticaria - people with this terrible disease need to keep finding out more information as I do believe there is something that causes it - whoever finds it could become a millionaire! there must be more to life than taking drugs which in the long run will cause something else!!!!

The only thing that reduces the itch is Triamcinoline Acetonide 0.1% cream. If I apply the cream to my legs and arms for 2 weeks, the hives (which can get as bad a big red pussy patches) and the sores disappear. When I stop, they first start on my ankle area, travel up my leg, then start on my forearms, and finally on my back. I've tried an elimination diet with no luck. Vitamin B's didn't help.The dermatologist took a culture which was negative. The dermatologist prescribed Hydroxyzine HCL 10 mg with taken once a day along with antihistamine Cetrizein Hydrochoride 10mg (Zyrtec). The antihistamine cocktail does not stop the hives. I also tried the hydroxyzine with Chlorpheniramine Maleate 4mg and loratadine 10 mg (Claritin). This didn't stop the hives either. I'd prefer to get off the Triamcinoline because it thins the skin. Has anyone had any luck with increasing the antihistamine dosage or using a different antihistamine? Has anyone experiences bad side effects from doubling/tripling any of the antihistamines I've listed above?Many thanks for your replies."

They NEED to get on with their research. This is a deeply FRUSTRATING, IRRITATING, SCARY, DISTRESSING, PHYSICALLY AND PSYCHOLIGALLY DEPRESSING condition and CIA diagnosis is just not good enough. And most of us CIU sufferers are the type of people who 'don't like to keep complaining', so we put up with the damned itching and also we're too EXHAUSTED with the condition to keep running to the doctor every few days. GPs don't seem to know who to refer us to. We go for allergy tests, nothing is detected, we're put on antihistamines, they don't work. We go to dermatologists, same thing all over again, all tests are done to RULE OUT this and that, but never to RULE IN. In the UK, there are 'within normal limits' criteria for blood tests. What if you have a body that doesn't work alongside the 'norm'? Your overlooked.I started with this CIU during a really persistent chest infection which wouldn't go away. I knew exactly where in my right lung the pest was living and yet my GP continually 'couldn't hear anything' with the stethoscope, but I could FEEL something not right. Then I had C reactive protein tests which showed and inflammation 'somewhere in my body' but they didn't know where. I KNEW WHERE.I suffered with breathing problems and this stupid CIU for 10 months, ended up in A & E several times with angio-oedema and anaphylaxis, now carry an Epipen. The rash eventually subsided after almost a year, but not due to antihistamines because they didn't work, some even made it worse.But my skin remained itchy all over. So I live with constant itching. Two months ago, the rash flared up, I still have it, been to my GP, given Atarax at first which made it worse. Went back, given Cetirizine 3 a day, Ranitidine one a day plus Monteleukast if that didn't work. Before I had the chance to even take that, I had to be rushed to A & E a few days ago because the rash was creeping up to my throat and head and I felt my tongue tingling and had a fat lip. Put on IV Piriton, steroids, sent home after 6 hours with a 5 day course of Prednisolone steroid tabs. Still had the rash but it went down and for ONE DAY I WAS TOTALLY ITCH FREE. BLISS.But it's now back again and I'm feeling really desperate. I work in a psychiatric hospital, my job is stressful, I can't concentrate and can't afford to make mistakes in my work. I have no social life because I look like a cross between a leper and a lousy dog! And most days I just feel that life isn't worth living if I have to continue like this. In fact I don't WANT to live if I have to live with this. That's how bad this skin condition makes me feel. And that's what I'm going to tell my GP next week when I see her because they have to really sit up and take notice where this CIU is concerned and stop fobbing us off with 'it's not life threatening, it will pass, it will burn itself out eventually'. Thanks to all the posters here for their contributions about what has or hasn't worked for them. "

I then started to break out in hives, all over my legs, arms, torso, back, feet - the only place it didn't hit was my face. I didn't change anything, no new soaps, detergents, no new foods. Nothing. Again, nobody else in my home had any issues/itching.My GP referred me to a dermatologist, who at first said, it was scabies. He sent me for a round of blood work and gave me a lotion to use, as well as Atarex before bed and Benadryl as needed. It continued through the fall and on Dec 22, I called his office in tears.The itching was unbearable and I hadn't slept much for weeks. He started me on oral Prednisone for 8 weeks, and booked an appt for follow up after the holidays. After about 3 weeks, I called back, as I was no better. He booked me for an appt and then a follow up biopsy. That morning, I had a fresh batch of hives on my leg that he took the sample from. Results? Hives. No shirt Sherlock! I could have told you that. By this time, I was on Kenalog injections and then one day in March, I realized I was not itchy. The body hives went away and the itchy around my bottom went away. I was cured!But about 2 months ago, the itching started around my bottom again and 2 night ago, I started breaking out in hives. I still have 2 Kenalog injections to go and am ready to lose what is left of my mind. I really feel there is something more going on and I do not know where to turn.

"Urticarial Rash","Cholinergic Urticaria has ruined my life ","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/cholinergic-urticaria-has-ruined-my-life-271237","Hello.I am a 28 year old male living in the UK with my parents. I weigh 70kg and am 186cm tall. I have been suffering with Cholinergic Urticaria for 9 months. I am in desperate need of help. Previous to developing this condition, I had no health issues whatsoever. I have been a competitive middle distance runner for the past 7 years, training every day. I have been heavily active all my life.This condition materialised in the space of approximately 2 weeks. In that time I became entirely incapacitated in my ability to run.As a result I visited my GP. A blood test revealed a slightly underactive Thyroid. This became the focus for my Doctor and my skin condition was ignored. Avoiding the immediate prescription of hormone replacement therapy, a repeat blood test was scheduled 2 months later to assess any change in the function of my Thyroid. Sure enough, and without any intervention, my TSH had come down significantly. Although not yet back in the 'normal range', I am schedule to have yet another blood test next month.My doctor failed to acknowledge any relationship between an underactive Thyroid and Urticaria, and whenever the question was asked he became evasive.My Urticaria worsened, it's affects no longer confined to when I ran but also when I walk, take a warm shower, lift something, feel stressed, anxious, if I'm in a warm building, when I sleep, when I'm in a car, if I trip. Almost everything I do is now affected, rendering whatever I am trying to do physically impossible. My outbreaks are not just itchy, they are excruciatingly painful. I often feel light headed and nauseous during an outbreak and have nearly passed out on occasion. I have to withdraw myself from whatever situation I may be in, in order to cool my body.I worked for 6 years as an Account Executive, but last year decided to try something new. I have since lost my job as a Postman, having fallen short of the attendance standards required during probation. I started in January, and was fit work due to cooler weather conditions. In May, whilst on delivery, I was unable to continue. I was unable to work and after 15 days of sick I was dismissed.Because of the warm summer weather I am extremely unlikely to find alternative work. The thought of sitting in an interview wearing a suit in this temperature causes me to itch. Driving my car is often not possible, nor safe, and I cannot wear anything more than running shorts and a loose fitting t-shirt. My aforementioned symptoms of Urticaria are simply not conducive with job searching/working. Despite having been in full time work since graduating, I cannot apply for Disability Benefit because I have too much money accrued in savings, most of which I had intended to use as a deposit on a house. I cannot apply for Job Seekers Allowance because I am unfit for work.I was prescribed some Cetrizine, it did nothing. I was prescribed Cetrizine in conjunction with Monteluklast, it did nothing. I was reffered to the Dermatology unit at my local hospital. I provided a physical demonstration of my Urticaria and was prescribed Fexofenadine, it did nothing. I have since been placed on Fexofenadine 180mg, twice a day, and Propranalol 40mg, twice a day. Despite saying he has never seen such a severe case of Urticaria, the specialist doesn't want to see me again saying he has very little more to offer in the form of treatment options. 4 weeks on and despite feeling ill most of the time, these tablets are doing nothing.I have scheduled an appointment in September with a separate Dermatologist in order to get a third opinion.I am depressed. My life has stopped. I am now, as I am everyday, sat on my bed. Confined to living a solemn and sedentary existence. I feel lazy. I feel worthless. I cannot socialize for fear of suffering an outbreak in public. My fear is only further compounded by the thought of suffering an outbreak and being unable to affect it. The pain is shocking. I cannot imagine the toll this has already had on my health both mentally and physically; the physical pain of an outbreak seems an entirely unnatural and extreme stressor for my body to have to deal with on a daily basis. As is my transition from running 75+ miles per week, to doing nothing at all, alongside my rapidly deteriorating mindset. It's formally documented that this debilitating condition has a greater impact on ones quality of life than that of skin cancer, yet because it's not life threatening in itself it seems no one wants to know. Why is so little known about a disease with such devastating consequences?I need help. I life like this is a life I do not want to lead and will not continue to lead if I do not witness a significant change in my circumstances. I've had enough and am now very suicidal. "

I see a lot of people out there asking if it’s, this or that that causes triggers. During my lifetimes (it started at 11) experience I can say you are probably all correct. Reoccurring tonsillitis was my catalyst, along with regular antibiotics to clear the infections. I didn’t have my tonsils removed until 30 something by which time the surgeon said they as good as fell out they were that rotten. Over time I noticed rashes would kick off if I ate or drank too much acid based produce oranges, lemons, aspirin, jams, dried fruits, honey. Now I was reacting to antibiotics, some cleaning chemicals (swimming pool had to stop) and different medications. I would also react if I picked up an infection of any kind tooth abscess, fungal infections etc. I did a little research (medical profession didn’t have a clue) and found if I could keep my salicylate levels down I would be rash free. But once my personal level had been breached, all hell would break loose. I would be covered in rash (pathetic little word for the damage it does) from the soles of my feet to the top of my scalp. Your whole body is alive with insane itchiness, I can feel oedema due to the tightness and there is a burning sensation. I feel battered and sore once the swelling subsides. My skin turns from natural to blue, covered in these welts, I feel cold and shake. You can feel various cycles of an outbreak on your body. This is just the physical cost. Mentally it’s soul destroying because nobody can do anything. Even the medical profession has given up. It isolates you because nobody else understands the impact it has on you, your temper, your looks, relationships, employment etc. But you know all this, because you’re reading this, right?!i think in years to come they will find a connection between gut flora diversity and your immune system. In the meantime, if you get an outbreak, cut everything (and I mean everything) back to basics. Follow a low salicylate diet drink only water, speak with your GP if you are on any medications, bath daily in an Epsom salt bath (soak 20 mins) take anti histamines, and try using fresh aloe Vera on the skin. You will have to maintain this until ur salicylate levels are back to YOUR normal, which can be weeks/months then you can slowly and sporadically start bringing different foods back into your diet. We aren’t as medically advanced as we like to think we are. It sucks, but there it is. Good luck. "

"Urticarial Rash","Horrendous ","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/horrendous-658727","Hi, I’ve started with hives a few weeks ago now. My first symptom was a swollen lip then the rash came.My doctors think it could possibly be a side effect to my blood pressure tablets, ramipril - has anyone else experienced this? I’ve been on 2.5mg daily for over a year. They have since the rash changed them twice so I’m hoping this new one works!Anti histamines are not working, I am now trailing pritze at night, last night was the first night and I’ve woken up with my legs covered in these awful red marks which will merge and burn me by the end of the day.I have been looking into it and the majority think hives are food related, so I need to changed my diet too and see if that works.Never have I felt pain like it, it is quite depressing to read that it can go in for years, I just need to sort it out and get rid!!!Any advice/help would be appreciated."
"Urticarial Rash","Has anyone else experienced hives after metal implant surgery?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/has-anyone-else-experienced-hives-after-metal-implant-surgery--611178","about a minute agoI began experiencing physical urticaria in March, with a rapid onset after a surgery in which a metal implant was used to correct a broken wrist. After being prescribed to high dosages and mixes of Prednisone, Zantac, Xyzal, Allegra, Singulair, etc. I was approved to start Xolair in May. The results were tremendous and I was able to get approved for the Copay program (does not depend on income). After living 30 years of my life with very little issues, the rapid onset after surgery led me to have the implant removed this last Friday. Post-surgery I have had NO hives. My surgeon, PCP and Dermatologists all told me it was a one in ten million chance that I was having a reaction to the alloy metal. However, my amazing Allergist (who initially led me to Xolair) let me know that studies on metal implant allergies are so limited and difficult to diagnose. I was lucky that my symptoms from the allergy were so quickly evident that it became very easy to point to the implant as a potential cause. I would urge anyone who has chronic urticaria and a metal implant to consider this rarely diagnosed cause! "

My condition goes like this: I am exposed to the sun directly for over an hour, and around 24-48 hours later, my skin breaks out into hives in all the same places (face, inside of arms, thighs, back of knees). It’s always very itchy and lasts a few days at least. This doesn’t sound like solar urticaria because SU is caused almost immediately after sun exposure, and disappears within a few hours. I am so miserable with this condition especially in the summer months. I’ve thought about Xolair shots but they’re for chronic idiopathic urticaria, not for the symptoms I’m describing.

Just the one! After a few hours I started developing a more widespread red ‘heat-looking’ rash and didn’t look into it too much. The next day I was covered head to toe in itchy, burning hives. For the last few weeks I haven’t been able to sleep properly due to the horrendous itching everywhere from my scalp all the way down to my toes. I don’t think there’s a part of my body that hasn’t had hives or a rash!In the first week I also had swelling round my eyelids. Things then progressed to me becoming very wheezy. I would get a burning red thumping rash round my mouth and would almost instantly be short of breath. I’m also radiating heat all over - particularly from my ears and I can’t step out in the sun for more than 2 mins without having a sudden burning rash and hives appear.The rashes a mixture of classic welts, red streaks and patches of flat red blotches. It looked really gruesome at some point, almost like extremely inflamed acne.Also my eyes are intermittently burning. I’ve cried (a lot!) and it’s like I’ve been chopping onions once there’s any fluI’ve done a steroid burst, fexofenadine, ranitidine, montelukast and nothing is bringing me full relief. Stopped steroids after 11 days due to horrendous side effects.I’m really not one for allergies at all, this is so unlike me! I have investigated all possible foods and triggers and I can’t see a pattern. I’m due to go for an allergy blood test tomorrow. All other blood work fine apart from slightly high mycoplasma titre but considered ‘normal’. Doctors have checked me over.I’m terrified this is going to last forever things are worse since stopping the steroids... anyone else had anything similar?! My scalp is so incredibly itchy. I have no sore throat, runny nose or any other ‘under the weather’ symptoms. "

I didn’t think much of it, assuming I had eaten something I was allergic to. I rubbed a liquid benedryl cream on it and went on with my day and it seemed to go away on its own within a few hours. The next morning I woke up with it again. And then again. And again. I’ve continued to wake up with it every morning since then and it’s not just in my sleep that it appears. Coming home from work one evening, I got it shortly after laying down on the couch for a few minutes. It began on my neck and then began to spread all over my face. So it seems to mainly come at night except for a few instances when I began to get it all over my face and neck. It only appears when I’m at home and goes away when I’m at work or out doing something. I’ve seen a doctor about it and she didn’t seem too concerned... she told me it was hives and that it is most likely caused by something external rather than internal (something that I’m eating that I’m possibly allergic to) because it goes away and doesn’t continue to stay on my body throughout the entire day. The main reason I am concerned is because it seems that every day I get it, it’s getting worse. At first it was only on my back but now it is all over my body including my neck, face and scalp. I am writing this post covered in a rash and my lip looks like I have bad lip injections because it is on my lip too, causing it to swell. I’ve narrowed it down to a couple of things I think it can be... one being possibly my dog. It’s been a month since I bathed him and I think something on his fur can be causing this reaction. I also think it could possibly be mold in my house. We have bad plumbing and neighbors in the complex have experienced mold growing because of the plumbing as well. We have had a couple of leaks in our house and don’t know that they were properly taken care of. Please help me. I am so tired of this rash and I am nervous it will keep getting worse."

Hear my story:My hives would manifest at night, close to bed time, and if I managed to sleep without hives I would wake up the next day covered on them, and if I didn't take any antihistamines it would become worse and worse everyday.Also have angioedema, and I would get very swollen lips, eyelids and even my penis and scrotum, it was really bad!Also I had pressure urticaria, if I wear some tight clothes or sit in a chair that is pressuring my hips, or etc, I would get a huge hive in the area that was pressured for about 48hs.Had some cold urticaria aswell, would happen on colder days and/or when I swim on a pool (in which my body temperature would be lowered and then covered in hives)Well, during this almost 2 years facing this problem I've tried a lot of treatments on my own, that's because my doctors always put me on steroids and antihistamines because they can't find the cause of my problem, probably autoimune.And what worked best so far but not 100% was the paleo diet with vitamin supplements, specially vitamin D3, but since follow this diet is kind of hard, I was always having episodes of hives, but it works if you follow it.Even with this paleo diet I was still doing some extensive research and testing on myself, found out about LDN and for me it is the best treatment so far, which put me on remission after 3 weeks on it.For those who don't know, LDN is Low Dose Naltrexone, and is used to treat Multiple Sclerosis, but there are a lot of studies showing that this medication really improves a lot of conditions all linked to autoimune disorders, so I decided to experiment for my Chronic Hives, I take 4,5mg at midnight right before bedtime. What it does is that it kind of ""hard reset"" your immune system, and re-balance it, so if it's off track and it is the source of your Chronic Hives you certainly would see improvements, also improves health in general.I've started this treatment early Feb this year, and I still can't believe, it's so nice to not have this debilitating illness, feels so good to do what ever I can, and not worry about hives.So if you have idiopathic chronic urticaria, I most certainly think it's worth a try.But be warned, if you want to start on LDN the first week or two you can experience some bad nausea, they say that if you feel nauseous is that the medication is working, and I had some really bad days on the first 10 days, pushed through the side effects and then they were gone, now I'm feeling great, after 3 weeks my hives were gone, and never came back. I didn't have one single day without hives since 2015, and somedays they made me really miserable, even triggering depression and suicide thoughts.Well, sorry for the big text, but I wanted to share with you guys, because I've been reading this stories for a long time, and I think LDN might work for you that didn't found a specific cause for your hives!Be safe.Gustavo!"

Like most of you my rash appeared out of no where, after a couple of weeks and no change I took myself off to see my gp who diagnosed me with urticaria (not specifically which type) . My symptoms were a full body rash with each flare up lasting a few days then a couple days they were in remission then boom back to square one. My main struggle was having an active job (gardener) I would come home jump in the shower and before you know it the soles of my feet and my knees would blow up and become extremely painful to the point where I couldn't even walk therefore work. Also my during the night I'm waking up freezing but absolutely soaked from intense sweating.I've tried all kinds of diets and cut certain things from my diet. I'm 25 years old and would say I'm a fit young man my diet however was pretty rubbish and I can't obviously see whats going on under the skin and in my gut.When it all started I was 15stone and now after 6 months I weigh just under 12 stone and feel like a fading away. I think alot of the weight loss stems from been too scared to eat thinking I'll flare up 30 minutes after a meal so then more or less starving myself which has now got to the point where I dont want to loose any more weight but struggling to keep it on.I recently watched a documentary on netflix called fat, sick and nearly dead. The fella in this suffered with numerous illnesses including urticaria. He went on a 30 day juice fast and he said it cleared up. I've started with the juices only 10 days ago whilst eating meals but still having flare ups. I dont want to go full juice fast as im sure by the end of the 30 days there will be nothing left of me.I honeslty don't know where to start so any advise will be incredibly helpful.

"Urticarial Rash","numb extremities and Uticaria ","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/numb-extremities-and-uticaria-635711","Self diagnosed cold uticaria sufferer. Wondering if I should be concerned about an autoimmune disorder? History:When I was young, 13-15, I experienced intense raised itchy hives on my thighs after coming inside from the cold. They were incredibly itchy but would go away quickly. I never told anyone about them. I thought it was a normal part of warming up. (haha) Didn't have hives for over 15 years. Was this because I started driving and spending less time walking in the cold? I think so.PRESENT: I am now 30, female, and this is acting up again, but only on my face and it is not itchy.The hives are darker, purple or red in shade and raised. I cannot feel them and only notice them in the mirror. They go away after apprx 3-5 hours. I have noticed other changes in my skin. My hands are incredibly dry and my legs are covered in thin purple shades. They almost make a scale pattern, but are not thin like varicose veins. MOST CONCERNING: My long toe (toe next to pinky) goes completely numb and when I look at it it's white. Zero circulation. This has nothing to do with the cold. It just happens. My skin also becomes incredibly dry and flaky. Excessively so. THE QUESTION: Should I be concerned about an autoimmune disorder? A neurological disorder? OR, is it just poor circulation? Do any of you experience these other symptoms? Should I start to take my person concerns seriously? FEARS: diabetes, hepatitis, multiple sclerosis, form of heart disease and finally celiac. Health Habits: Was an athlete most of my life. Drink more than my doctor would like.. but probably no more than average (5-6 drinks a week. Usually less, rarely all 5 drinks in one night). Do not exercise aside from leading active lifestyle. (skiing twice a month, work a job that keeps me walking, bending ect.)Thank you for sharing your experience and opinion. "

Since this is my 3rd round I sort of know what has worked for me and what doesn't, what I think causes it, & what triggers it. But as all of you know the bottom line is there are no concrete answers. I refuse to take the drug Xolair- the side affects are way worse than the hives!! I'm at the point where I am on antihistamines all day and night. I can't sleep at night and I can't function properly during the day. You all know what its like! I dread taking another medrol dose pack. I feel awful. I notice that when I eat they get worse. I also realize that the longer I have them, the more problems flare up. My gums will bleed, joints will swell- things that only happen while I have CH, so I won't let dentist or docs treat for things that I think just flare up because every time they go away when the hives do. My daughter bought this giant aloe leaf and scraped it out and i keep the fresh aloe in the fridge and it helps momentarily (I think because it's cold) but I go through constant waves of being super hot, to freezing cold.

I have been suffering from chronic urticaria and angioedema for the past 20 years off and on. I am 34. In the past, the flare ups lasted 8-9 months and I responded to prednisone, sulfasazine, Zyrtec, Zantac, atarax, etc. This current flare up started August 2016 and the hives and swelling have been occurring on a daily basis to the point of debilitation. We followed every protocol and step for treatment for hives and swelling to no avail. I have tried immunosuppressants, sulfasalazine, high doses of steroids, H1 and H2 antihistamines, Xolair, etc. My doctors are baffled with my lack of response to traditional treatment.I have Hashimotos Thyroiditis and markers for lupus as well as other auto immune disorders. My doctor (allergist/immunologist) recommended IVIG therapy and while this is an unconventional approach, it is helping and reducing the occurrence of hives and swelling. When it was first recommended, the insurance company denied me so I had to appeal twice (i showed up to the second hearing with hives and swollen eyes and lips). I sent them a binder of 100 pictures (picture diary of hives), letters from doctors and research articles to help my case. After, several months, I was approved for a 6 month trial, even though my doctor wants me to receive IVIG for 12 Months at a high dose and then maintenance IVIG after a year. Has anyone had any experience with IVIG therapy for chronic hives and refractory angioedema? Thanks!Nadia"

I was so depressed that I couldn't figure out what was happening to me and there wasn't much information about the condition. But after spending hours every day for a long time researching this condition, experimenting with everything and anything I could, I finally found something that worked for me. First of, I'll explain what happened. I played sports my whole life but when I was 19, I was playing ice hockey and I started to get rashes during and after play. I wasn't sweating at all. It happened on a just a normal random day, I play hockey twice a week and had done for years. It came out of nowhere. A few months later, I moved to Australia and basically couldn't live because the weather was so warm and I couldn't sweat. I was anxious and depressed because every time I was supposed to sweat I broke out in rashes. I spoke to numerous doctors and specialists, spent hours on forums, all of this to seek a solution. Finally I looked into a website that claimed to have a cure. I forget the name however, essentially the solution was a lifestyle change. I realised I ate junk my whole life, I also had a blood test and realised I was intolerant to wheat, milk and eggs even tho I had been consuming these intolerances my whole life but perhaps my gut had enough and was acting up. So I had an allergy free diet, ate organic, natural and healthy foods. I juiced daily. All this for an entire year, I gradually saw improvement over the year and finally I was cured. No more rashes. I couldn't believe it, I could finally live without anxiety. I'm completely normal now and I'm so happy. I'm sorry I can't find the name of this website but it's out there. But I would suggest to everyone that's suffering to have a blood test, see if your intolerant to anything, look at your diet, figure out if your eating crap. Lead a healthy lifestyle, juice daily, eat clean and give it time, give your gut a rest, time to reset it self, the gut can do this. I hope you all find this helpful, it worked for me.

"Urticarial Rash","Urticaria rash with joint stiffness","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/urticaria-rash-with-joint-stiffness-618601","Hi,I found this forum when researching urticaria and thought I'd like to hear your thoughts on this. About a month ago I had a bad flu and I was already starting to feel better when I got urticaria/hives all of a sudden. It started on my hip and in 2 days 90% of my body was covered and the itching and agony was absolutely unbearable. I went to a hospital three times and first they gave me steroids, then they told me they had found a trace of bacteria in my blood and decided to treat me with antibiotics. The next day another doctor said there is no need for antibiotics and they prescribed me antihistamine. I took 3 x 10mg Cetrine and 1 x 25mg Atarax daily for 2 weeks and now I've been reducing the dose week by week as the doctor advised to do so. When my urticaria started I experienced severe stiffness and swelling in my joints; feet, knees, wrists, fingers, hip... It came in waves and it was weird as one moment I was able to get up without any assistance and take off my clothes and the next I was unable to even pull up my pants without help. My doctor said the stiffness was due to high histamine levels in my body. At the moment I'm taking 1 x 10mg Cetrine and 1 x 25mg Atarax and I've noticed that the stiffness is coming back, especially my groins, elbows and knees are aching and it makes moving difficult. Have you had similar experiences? Did you get rid of the stiffness? In the hospital they took x-rays and they looked fine, but I'm freaking out as I love sports and I can barely walk 3k at the moment without my groins starting to hurt and me feeling fatigued. This is the first time I ever had urticaria and I'm afraid of it becoming chronic. Antihistamines make me very tired and anxious and I can't concentrate on anything and I forget things all the time so this has had a big impact on my life. Doctors said that most likely it was the flu that triggered the urticaria but also stated that we will probably never find out for sure what it was.Thank you for reading this and take care!Maija"
"Urticarial Rash","Allergic to antihistamines????? ANY INFO MUCH APPRECIATED","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/allergic-to-antihistamines-any-info-much-appreciated-17757","Hi guys,Firstly, oh my god. I dont think you realise how happy i am at finding this site. I genuinly thought i was one of a few people who suffered this horrendous \""thing\"". That is how i refer to it now. A \""thing\"". I am 20 years old and am having an awful time with urticaria. All started in Feb so 5 months ago now. Firstly was told by GP that it will go in 6 weeks so felt very optimistic. 6 weeks came and went but still felt it might go...after 3 months realised this may with me a bit longer than first anticipated. Saw 5 more GP's all who gave me different anti-histimines-none that worked, in fact, some made it worse!! Constantly asked to be referred to Dermatologist with no avail. Gp's said it was a last resort. They really didnt seem to care and to be honest were plain awful. It finally took a scary trip to A&E when rash became to much to bare and started affecting my breathing for them to actually refer me. I was in A&E for 11 hours on a drip filled with renitidine and steroids. It did knock me for 6 because i was really quite worried by this point. So finally had my first Dermatologist appointment 2 weeks ago where they explained my \""condition\"" and prescribed me on a course of 3 tablets a day for 28 days. on the first day of taking these antihistimines i had terrible stomach ache and felt sick and tired, and whats worse the rash was extremly bad. so called them up and they told me to stop taking the tablets. They got me back in and said that i am now to do nothing for 6 weeks. dont take any antihistimines they have said and go back in 6 weeks. Kind of feel like im right back at step one. I genuinly belive that when i take antihistimines it makes the rash worse...has anyone else thought this? I dont know whether to try the tablets again and give them a chance, maybe if id have carried on for a few weeks it may have eventually gone, but surely im not expected to go out with that thing all over my face and body and live with that for god knows how long. Im only 20 and i have to go out in the sun in long sleeves because im so paranoid. It gets me down so much and im lucky to have friends that support me but honestly i cant go on like this anymore. I feel for you all so so much and my thoughts are with all of you as we battle through this stupid illness that still nobody seems to care about.Please let me know if anyone else has reacted badly to any antihistimine. then maybe i can have some piece of mind. One thing that made me laugh was the antihistimine i was prescribed said on the leaflet \""may cause urticaria\""!! fantastic hey!!Well hope this sheds some light on anyone else experiencing same sort of thing.Laura"

Basically in Nov 2014 i went out with a few friends to a seafood restaurant( im not allergic to seafood btw). I had some calamari and guinness. Later that evening i noticed a small bump or rash on my chin. I was surprised because Im from the Caribbean(we eat alot of seafood) but i went to the pharmacy and bought some zrytec. Took it and the rash went away.About two weeks later the left side of my face became swollen. Went to the campus doctor (I go to school in Canada) and they gave me some antibiotics to try and those did not help. They then did some blood work for my thyroid, tested for mumps and for cellulitus. THey all came back negative. So i began praying to God for some help because the swelling would reapear every 4 days after it intially goes down. The annoying part was that it would be different parts of my face that would begin to swell. My eyebrow, eyelid, chin, cheeks, forehead.In January 2015 I was given an appointment with a local allergist who told me i was experiencing chronic uticaria and angioedema. SHe tested for HAE but that came back negative as well. She started me out on ceterizine 20mg a day for a month and told me to come back. Over that month the symptoms did not ease up and continue to ravage on. I became self conscious and started to become depress and started to skip classes because of my swollen face. I started eating alot more and stopped going to the gym as much causing me to go from 165 to 190 pounds by that summmer. Anyway I went back to the allergist the following month and she told me to contine with the same treatment for another month. To no avail the same problem persisted. I prayed every night for help so that i would be healed from this illness. Everytime the swelling went away i was like finally tthis is going to be the last time but it wasnt. 4 months later she prescribed me to take ranitidine along with the cetirizine but it didnt work. FInally I went back home for the summer (8 months living with the angioedema symptoms) and saw an allergist there who took me off of all of the meds i was on. He told me that obiviously this drugs werent working for me and prescribed that i take 5mg of levocetirizine and 200mg of plaquenil twice a day(this was july 2015). Immediately i began to see results and the swelling went away and didnt reappear at all. I continued that regime for the next 5 months. I curently take half a plaquenil and one 5mg levocetrizine every 2 months. I havent had an angioedema attack since July 2015. I thought about telling my story before but I prayed on it and wanted tto be sure i waas cured of the angioedema before i shared with everyone. I use to think there was no cure for it but God answered my prayers. He led me to the right allergist who was able to rectify the problem. I was told to share my testimony with you guys. To let you know that through God all things are possible once you have faith. I hope my story encourages someone out there to not give up.There is a cure and a way to live without the daily stress of angioedema and urticaria.God Bless Everyone"

Today I had blood work done and should know the results of that in a few days. My doctor has now prescribed a regimen of Claritin, Zantac (prescription strength twice a day) and Atarax every night. I've never taken Atarex before so tonight will be the first. I am looking for reassurance I guess --- that sometimes we never truly know the cause for the hives but that they can and do last for weeks, even months. One common denominator for me was that about the same time as I broke out, #1, I had microneedling done on my face and #2, I began helping a family member clean and remodel a house that was filthy AND had a CAT. Thank you in advance for sharing your insight..... "
"Urticarial Rash","How I'm Fighting Urticaria / Hives","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/how-i-m-fighting-urticaria-hives-518790","Hi, I just thought I'd post a bit about what I've found that might help some of you suffering from Urticari / Hives. I've had it for 5 weeks permanently, so technically its still counted as ""acute"", but it might be useful to chronic sufferers (6 weeks or more).What I’ve found is Antihistamines don't work for everyone. For me, first time I had this, Atarax just wiped it out. Second time 15 years on, I was given Fexofenadine 120mg, but it didn't really help. I think mine are anxiety related.Anyway, here's what I tried:Beer eliminated them just like that. (no good if you have a wheat/barley allergy though)…but it comes back once the alchohol wears off and codeine levels get back to normal. But at least if it works for you, you get some sleep.This routine worked:1. Bought a huge tube of E45 and carried it everywhere. Any itch anywhere got a splat of the stuff.2. Took the antihistamine 120mg as instructed each day…plus an extra 60mg. Every little helps.3. Slurped down 3/4 cups of green tea a day.4. Changed clothes twice a day.5. Drank about 2 litres of water a day.6. Washed bedding twice a week without powders or liquids.7. Didn’t drink any alcohol (even though it helps) for a week just to reboot the system. 8. Tried to keep to my normal daily routine and spoke to others about my symptoms rather than feel awkward.**Be careful with the green tea – some people get hives from caffeine. So possibly try caffeine free. Always non bleaced bags.**Be careful with alcohol – if it doesn’t help, its not for you, and moderation is the key.Urticaria can be caused by heat, allergies to shellfish, alcohol, caffeine, or a host of other things. Thats why its not easy to find a quick fix.Hope this helps"

"Urticarial Rash","PLEASE READ IF YOU ARE SUFFERING FROM HIVES","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/please-read-if-you-are-suffering-from-hives-437553","EVERYONE READ....THIS WORKS!!!! Hello all, I am new to the site as far as contributing but have been reading posts for a few months now. I have had hives for almost 6 months now and as all of you know, it is worse than horrible. I have been to my GP, Dermatologist, Urgent care twice and 1 trip to ER in search of answers or at least some relief. I have been unable to sleep during this entire thing except for an hour or 2 here and there. Until last night. A few days ago I read a post from ""hives and thyroid"" about her cocktail which she swears works. Yesterday I go to the Allergist still looking for answers and my main concern I will be off my 5th round of steroids since January, and I know it will come back very strong. After talking a while she changed my antihistamine to Doxepin. Hmmm, that sounds familiar...I went home and read the post again and yes, it is one of the drugs that worked for her. Singular I am already on. Thats 2 of the 3!!! The other is Zantac..over the counter. I picked up a box and went home and made my cocktail....Singulair 10 mg. Doxepin 25mg. and Zantac 150 mg. I KID YOU NOT GUYS...MY ITCHING STOPPED WITHIN AN HOUR. TODAY ALMOST 24 HOURS LATER, STILL NO ITCH!!!! The hives are slowly fading as well but they dont itch!! It seems that the combination of these drugs hits all the H1/H2 receptor sites to stop the histamine from being released into the body. The Zantac hits the receptor site H2 which it seems the other antihistamines do not. Zantac, who knew??? I feel like a new person. What a relief. Talk to your doctors and get these 3 meds!!!!! I will keep you posted on my progress...Now to find the cause of it .btw...Zantac (ranitidine) was first developed to be a histamine antagonist, hence it's use, along with other antihistamines, for hives. Good luck everyone, I know you are all as desperate as I am"

I also have the angedomenia alot of the time. I just,wanted to share the one thing i haven't read that people have tried but im using and its the best thing ever. Is aloe vara gel. I know its may,sound odd as were all used to take a shead load of tablets etc. But it actually works!!!!,I apply it as often as i need to when o have a bad flare up or to the effected areas when i need to. Its a natural,anti inflammortary and believe the welts go down instantly to just,faint red blotches, theyre still there but not as bad and as foe the itching it does stop. I find it so much better than taking a load of tablets etc bit i still tablets when it gets unbareable. It also soothes and cooks the skin and i notice and immediate difference now im Using it. The only thing id like to say is it is unbarable and very,depressing bit please if you haven't tried aloe vera go and buy some and see how you get on. Anything is worth a try with this condition. If you let mW know how and of it helps we all need to share what,are possibities to try and live a bit better with this.. Pleas try it!!,"

The damage to my skin on prednisone is interesting. The lowest dose of prednisone was 25mg qd before the hives returned mild-moderately. Currently I'm taking prednisone 15mg bid and lowering by 5 mg q 2days. I have never wanted to quite a drug more.Essentially, I am an RN and am getting my MSN/FNP soon, but the condition sucks and really makes me appreciate good health days. There is just this underlying fear of waking up itching, which is how my sx present. It's why I always take OTC 1st gen-antihistamines prn while weaning off prednisone. I can accept that this may be a life-long problem, but I hate it . I am likely to be put on hydroxychloroquine or Plaquenil next week.I wish everyone out there the best in their journey with this condition ."

I wrote a big long response to ""Martin"", if anyone is interested in my recent history with hives. I just wanted to add a little here. Since March, these severe hives have been causing me so much distress and are affecting my life, socially, mentally, recreationally, and in every way! Each day I hope will be the end of them, yet they never go away completely....just fade a little, then return late afternoon. Through to the next morning. Every single day! 3 days a week they're severe, other days, moderate. Therthotrexate is not working yet (on it 2 weeks now). Dr said would take 3 weeks to kick in, though I feel tired and low from the side effects. I decided to help myself on a deeper level while working with the medication and dr. I've begun meditating twice daily, and letting this go, one moment at a time. Today I did not take the steroid since it was low dose and just wanted to wean off it. Hives are no different than on steroids today, so that's good. I am trusting my deeper self to help my body with this, I know I am in the process of healing this right now! I have never imagined hives could be distressing, and at times, debilitating. I wish all of you a quick return to your normal selves. I feel so badly for all of you who are suffering with this awful thing. Peace"
"Urticarial Rash","Chronic Urticaria - finally the nightmare is over!!!","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/chronic-urticaria-finally-the-nightmare-is-over--507290","In August 2015 I developed hives, completely out of the blue one sunny day. Starting on the soft skin on my arms and gradually spreading over time the outbreaks became more and more agressive. Primarily after exercise or being in the sun but also at other random times. I saw a dermatologist who diagnosed chronic urticaria and stated my return to excercise had caused it - just my sweat pores blocking and eventually it will be ok - keep exercising to unblock them. At one point I thought this was helping as the rash appeared to be burning itself out. However I got a rude awakening whilst on a weeks holiday for some winter sun. I had a massive outbreak the minute the sun touched my skin. I took piriton daily as this was the only anti histamine to work (fexafenadine caused a massive reaction of hives which ended up with me in A & E) I began to do much research into Urticaria and also the possibility that it may be linked somehow to my Mirena coil. The mirena being in situ for 3 years seemed an odd culprit but there were enough reports of this side effect to warrent removal. I had the mirena coil removed a week ago and during this time my hives have almost completely gone. Day by day there has been huge reduction in severity and as the effects of the coil wear off my skin is returning to its healthy state. I am ecstatic to finally be free of this horrific condition. Any ladies out there suffering with this - check your contraception, particularly if it's the Mirena coil. "

"Urticarial Rash","Seasonal Urticaria - February to May in the UK","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/seasonal-urticaria-february-to-may-in-the-uk-16066","Since 2000 I have experienced chronic urticaria every year except for 2 years during the months of February, March, April and May. On each occasion the Urticaria has appeared within a day or so of 20th February and disappears within a day or so of 10th May.The urticaria moves around the body, so one day and night it will be concentrated around the chest, shoulders and neck, the next day on back shoulder blades and neck, the next day around the waist, groin and thighs, then arms, hands, etc. One of my urticaria's strangest idiosyncrasies is that alcohol consumption makes it entirely disappear for 12 hours or more. For the first few years I turned to alcohol as a form of medication, however over the years I realised that once the alcohol had left my system the urticaria would return more violently and cover a greater area of my body. I now don't consume alcohol at all during the months when the urticaria visits. The urticaria is therefore constantly on my body but I don't experience the extremes.I have previously been prescribed steroid treatment but this only dampened the symptoms for the course of the treatment and it would come back fully at the end of the course. I have visited my GP and been referred to the dermatology department at two local hospitals but because they can't establish the trigger easily they have not been interested in investigating further. The only medication that I currently take is Fexofenadine 180mg. This takes away the extreme itch and pain for approximately 8 hours. I take this in the morning so I don't itch and scratch my way through work but this leaves me with sleepless uncomfortable evenings.Does anyone else suffer from this seasonal form of Urticaria between February and May and if so has anyone had the trigger successfully diagnosed. Can anyone recommend any other treatments?"

"Urticarial Rash","Suffering from Chrocin Urticaria for one year now","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/suffering-from-chrocin-urticaria-for-one-year-now-549255","In November 2015, I suddenly began feeling itching on my hands, and my feet. I am based in Abu Dhabi, and had just traveled to Lebanon and stayed in a room that was quite dusty. The itching was on and off for a few days and I didn't think much of it. I then traveled to Australia, again staying in a room which was dusty. The itching got worse, and for the first time, red patches with heat and small ""bumps"" in lines started to appear on different parts of my body. I went and saw my GP. I explained my travels, and he diagnosed me with Scabies, and prescribed medication for this. On researching Scabies, I was sure what I had was not scabies, but I completed the treatment. The itching did not stop, and in fact at times became quite intense, but then eased off at random times. I returned to Abu Dhabi, and with the rashes and itching continuing, especially at night, I went to see a dermatologist. He prescribed Telfast 180 antihistamines, which seemed to help control my condition, and asked me monitor my food intake over several days to see if any food item was causing my allergic reaction. Every time I thought I had found the trigger, it seemed to fail with the itching not stopping after days of control and monitoring of foods. The same doctor then suggested that I conduct some allergy tests. I did the first test (blood test) for food items (quite expensive and not covered by insurance, but had to be done as my frustration and itching had become quite intense!). The results came back with everything negative except dairy products. I was somewhat relieved to at least know trigger of my condition, and so I stopped all foods with dairy. Days passed, yet the itching did not stop. At times it actually became worse! The doctor was also confused and suggested I do another allergy test for dust and external factors. The testing place also did a food test again with this dust test. To my amazement and shock, all the results came back negative- including the dairy results, which had come back positive last time. I became more frustrated and the doctor seemed even more confused than before. Meanwhile, my condition continued to progress with severe itching in random and differing parts of my body, the worst place being the soles of my feet and my hands. It was excruciating, and I felt so helpless- at times I would be on the floor like a baby scratching uncontrollably. 4 months had now passed and I went back to the doctor demanding something more. He injected me with a cortisone shot. This actually made my skin break out in a horrible rash on my upper arm which took weeks to heal, but it did slow down the itching for some days. In the meantime I was taking one Telfast a day (at this stage not knowing it was safe for me to take more!!!!). I searched for allergy specialists in the UAE, and finally found one who made monthly visits from overseas. He examined me and after testing my skin for ""staining"" which he called ""dermatographism"", he told me I had an allergic condition known as ""chronic urticaria"", which was the first time I had heard of the name for my condition. He told me to be patient and continue to take antihistamines, but he also recommended I do a prick test. In July I visited Lebanon again and was able to find an experienced immunologist. She was great, and went through my condition in detail explaining that the cause was often never found, and that doing allergy tests was useless in most cases since with chronic urticaria, tests often gave ""false positives"", which explained my dairy findings- a false positive result. It was great hearing detailed information specific to my condition, but quite upsetting when she went through the statistics of the condition- something like 50 % of cases heal within a year, 30% within 5 years, and 20% have it for a life time. Also disturbing was the statistic that in 90% of cases, the cause is never found, while in 10% of cases, the cause can be something internal and often something serious (including cancer!). She told me my treatment would occur in stages. She wanted me to increase my Telfast 180 from 1 tablet to 2, 3 or even 4 tablets per day as long as no symptoms showed. If this dosage did not suppress the condition, she then mentioned other progressive medications, but told me to start with the Telfast for the coming weeks and months in the hope that this settle the mast cells back into a normal state. That was how she explained it. Over the next few weeks, I reached a dosage of 3 Telfasts per day (when I told pharmacists this, they would look at me in disbelief!). By October, I was back down to 2 tablets since for the first time in a long time, I was not feeling any effects of the condition. I was so happy thinking that my body was recovered, or at least almost recovered, and there were days that I actually was living a normal life again and not even thinking about itching or the skins outbreaks.However, it was just 3 weeks ago, that suddenly the rashes, the heat, and the itching returned completely unexpectedly and for no apparent reason since nothing in my life had changed. I was so hopeful that it was just a bad reaction for a day or 2. But with time, it was back with a vengeance- worse than before. I increased my dosage now to 4 tablets, yet the Telfast was now not relieving any of my symptoms- not even 4 tablets a day!!! For the first time I was even feeling tingles and swelling of my lips, and had redness on parts of my body previously not affected. I was completely distressed and went back to my skin doctor since I had no access to my immunologist. He told me that the new outbreak could have been triggered by some antibiotics which I had taken a couple of weeks earlier for a urinary infection. He could see no other reason for the return of the symptoms. However he could not explain why the Telfast was no longer working- I asked for a different antihistamine but he told me it would make no difference and to be patient for a few days to see if my body would settle again. It has now been 10 days, and I can only say that I am suffering badly, especially at night time, when it always seems to be much worse. It became so bad a few days ago that I pleaded with him to give me something else, and he prescribed a cortisone tablet per day- which has actually helped in reducing the itching at most times. But I am told that cortisone tablets are potentially harmful and should only be taken for a short time. He also gave me some lotion which did nothing to help.So here I am, writing in here out of desperation and extreme frustration. I understand that there are people with much worse and with life threatening conditions out there, but I just needed to post this to see what others have done to treat this condition, and whether I should still have hope that my body will actually recover back to the pre-unrticaria stage. Are there any suggestions from anyone who knows about this condition? Please, any advice would be appreciated. I am traveling to Australia next week- I tried to book an appointment with some good Allergy/ Immunology specialists, but to my dismay, most are booked out for up to a year!! I was lucky to find one allergy center that could take me early in December, but they want to conduct a range of allergy tests (even though my specialist in Lebanon suggested there is no point given the ""false positive"" results likely to happen). The other problem with conducting these tests is that they ask for you to stop taking all medications such as antihistamines and anti-inflammatory medications for around 5 days prior to the appointment. How will I be able to cope with the itching without taking any of these tablets for 5 days?? Do I have any other options??Sorry for the dramatic detail but I had to release my frustrations in this post in the hope of some good advice from others who have suffered from this or from any medics who might have some information."

"Urticarial Rash","Cholinergic Urticaria because of stress? Thoughts anyone?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/cholinergic-urticaria-because-of-stress-thoughts-anyone--540702","So my story begins when I was 14 years old. When I was a teenager, I had loads of stress in my life. I had pressure from school, social hardships making new friends at school and above all religious stress. I was very religious in that period of my life and I was feeling very guilty and having sleepless nights because of guilt every time I masturbated. It sounds very extreme I know but I was just a helpless teenager and I thought god was so mad at me and that I would burn in hell every time I masturbated. I then had a Varicocele surgery when I was 14. Ater that I got Cholinergic Urticaria. To be honest I cannot remember when the first time I got the Urticaria was. If it was before the surgery or after and that's why I am unsure if the anesthetic I got in the surgery has to do with it. Could that even be the case that my body got allergic to an anesthetic and I still have that allergy?So years went by and I was still feeling stressed every time I masturbated. I am nonreligious at the moment. I am 22 years old. The problem is that I still get this damn Urticaria. Especially after I have sex or masturbate. I do not know if this is even scientifically correct but It's like my body feels like the chemicals released after sex are dangerous to itself and cause stress so it reacts in an allergic way to them and gives me urticaria. I have tried the sweat therapy and it helps me for a day or 2 until my body rebuilds its histamine reserves. I am now wondering if I should keep masturbating and having sex to irritate my body until it gets sick of it and realizes it's ok to have these chemicals in my body or that I cut it out completely and see what happens.It is worth mentioning that it is way better in summer since I am exposed to heat more often. I also get the urticaria when I do sports or take a hot shower or whenever I go to a warm place in winter. I take 2 pills of Aerius at a time which is a Desloratadin and it helps to control the Urticaria. The problem is that I feel sleepy and not concentrated when I take it which is something that I cannot afford while studying. I also noticed that being stressed about something also increases the urticaria.The confusing part is that it disappears as soon as I start sweating! I really can't decide against what my body reacts! Like I keep scratching and I end up sweating and it all goes away. Is it really my sweat that stops it or is it that my body runs out of histamine?I am sorry that my article may sound unorganized but please read it all and try to give me answers about all the questions as much as you can!! I appreciate your help my brothers and sisters in Urticaria! I sooo wanna beat this damn monstrous handicap we all have!Much love!Room"

Every medication I have tried has worked at first but then stopped working after a period of a few weeks-months at a push. I'm currently taking ciclosporin which I've been on for 1 year 3 months now, I'm in 4 x fexofenadine a day, montelukast & doxepin (although I struggle to function the next day after taking this & have 2 young kids).Anyway, montelukast worked for 3 months & has now stopped & im at the end of my tether & actually feel a bit demented with the lack of sleep.. So I'm wondering if omalizumab might be the way to go.. Has anyone been given it in uk? If so did it happen same day as appointment? Did you have to wait? Good results?

"Urticarial Rash","Advice? Life-ruining, intense urticaria for 7 years?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/advice-life-ruining-intense-urticaria-for-7-years--512572","I finally made an account because I'm a little desperate from advice from you guys.I've had chronic urticaria for over 7 years now. It's completely destroyed my life with it's severity. To the point that I sometimes question if it's urticaria at all out of pure paranoia, but it's what the doctors tell me it is. It took awhile to get to the diagnosis, as I spent the first 3 years going through doctors who somehow had no idea what to do with me. (They tried antibiotics, creams, just telling me to take Claritin??? My very first doctor wouldn't even touch me, he stood on the other side of the room like I was infected.)If I wear my jeans too tight, a bracelet too long. If I nudge something wrong, or eat the wrong thing. Sometimes for no reason at all, I get large patches of swelling, red areas. Sometimes they are just small dots. The dots get larger and larger, they make little cliffs in my skin in large patches . I call myself the albino dalmatian, as that's what it looks like sometimes. The swelling, the itching I could handle. But the pain is intense. It swells so much and is so hot to the touch that if I get one on my neck, I can't turn it. If I get one on a leg, an arm, or a finger? I cannot bend that joint. At all. The ones on my feet at times keep me from walking and swells so much it feels like I'm stepping on a foreign object, like stepping on a ball on the carpet. I can't move in spots it's swollen like this.Someone here mentioned that they were prescribed (Ranitidine) and (Montelukast). This is the most recent attempt by my newest doctor. (He has a habit of explaining NOTHING to me.) He suggested a shot called ""Xolair"" that I have zero knowledge about. I keep reading about hair loss and all this other stuff, and I'm just so intensely frightened by all of it. I'm giving the medicine a try. I don't see a huge difference and it's so confusing to be taking medicine for heart burn, antihistamines, and stuff for asthma as I stare at my skin swelling up like this. Every doctor I've seen says that I have ""one of the most intense cases of it they've seen"". But could it be something else? I've been checked for everything under the sun and at this point trying to predict what causes it is like shaking a rainstick for me. There's no real telling if it's my diet or whatever else. I've tried to fast, I still would get the pressure hives no matter what. They swell, they are intensely hot to the touch, and recede by the next day like clock work as if nothing ever happened. I'm always amazed that my skin can stretch so much and not be causing permanent damage. The weirder thing is that I have zero food allergies before this all started when I was 22 or 23. I've just turned 30 now. I'm in good health, good weight, no bad habits. I'm completely confused to how I went from being a perfectly functioning human being unable to wear a pair of high heels without knowing I won't be able to walk that night when my feet swell up. If it gets on my lips or my chin I'm pretty much not going out, as I look like a monster. It swells up and my boyfriend lovingly calls it ""duck lips"", as I look like I got punched in the lip on one spot. (No, they don't entirely swell up like an allergic reaction. Just in one spot!) Does anyone have any advice for me? Has anyone experienced anything this bad? What medications worked for you? Maybe, has anyone had any experience or understand what Xolair is? Because I'm scared that it's going to cost a fortune and perhaps do more harm than good."

I couldn't walk a block without having to stop and scratch. I didn't think anything of it until I was 10. Every day at the exact same time I would breakout in hives all over my arms. I had dermatographic urticaria and was popping benadryl and falling asleep in class like it was a bad habit. My mom took me to the doctor and they gave me this medicine in 30 vials and I was to drink one each day for a month and then the hives stopped happening everyday.Between the ages of 11-13 I would randomly break out in hives, but they were so few and far between that it never really became a problem. When I was a freshman in high school, I became more aware of the fact that everytime I walked to school in the morning (about a mile), that I would start to itch about 2 blocks down from my house. The more I scratched, the more I itched. The more I ignored the itching, the more it began to burn. The itching would stop after I would go somewhere cold and go to town scratching my legs until the small hives, turned into long welts that covered my legs, but no longer itched or burned. This is still something that I struggle with to this day.After I graduated I began to get more afraid to leave the house, because walking was just not an option for me. It was so random to me. I could run and be fine, but walking was a problem. Even doing air guitar can cause my arms to itch uncontrollably.I am now 22 and recently I've been getting hives on random parts of my body, but mostly on my upper right arm. They'll start out as just itching, then they'll turn into hives, then the arm will be swollen under the hive area, then the hive will calm down, scab up, and turn into a bruise. It's a process that takes about a week or two, to fully go away be for the other ones start to form. This has been happening for the past 2 months. It happened on my left hip and on my ankle as well. I'm unaware of what to do about this because for the past 8 years, my hives have been contained to mostly my legs and are only caused by me walking (outside specifically) somewhere.I didn't even know urticaria was a word that existed until I was 17. I just figured that it was a weird thing that happened to me and that no one needed to know. I have not been professionally diagnosed and my current doctor just believes it's caused by sweat and that zyrtect (which i'm not covered for btw) is the solution to all my problems.I don't know what to do anymore, and my anxiety is just telling me that it's never going to get better and that I'll never be a fully functioning adult that will be able to go for a calm stroll without the fear of hives ruining my day."

It started out of nowhere and I thought it was an allergic reaction as hives were all over my hands, feet, chest, face, arms, mouth and then my throat closed up and was seen in the emergency room for anaphalactic shock and given high doses of Benedryl for H1, Zantac for H2 and steroids to get rid of the symptoms. The bendryl and zantac have done nothing to stop the attacks, so GP tried hydroxine which also didn't work. The only thing that seems to stop the symptoms is steroids. I am now taking a steroid injection every 8-9 hours to stop the symptoms as the prednisone tablets made me so nauseous I could not keep them done. This works well, but have gained 30 lbs in 6 weeks and the skin on my face and chest is one constant pimple like eruption. I have seen an allergist who did a whole battery of tests for allergies, etc. Everything was negative except my IGg antibodies which were very high. I am coming to the conclusion that this has nothing to do with allergies, etc. I believe that this is due to an autoimmune disorder. I was diagnosed last july 2006 with Multiple Sclerosis and I believe this is part of it. The allergist put me on Doxepin 150mg every night with Fexofenadyne 180mg every evening and every morning, but this has done nothing to help. Again, only the steroids relieve the symptoms but cause a host of other problems and you cannot be on them indefinately. I see my GP again this week and I believe the next step is to try immunosupressive drugs or Iv immunoglobin therapy. There has been success I heard of with these therepies, so I'm crossing my fingers. For all of you out there suffering from this debilitating disease I feel for you. This has been so depressing and frustrating for me as no one seems to really understand the problem. I do know that if you are suffering, you need to be your own researcher and doctor on this. Push for testing of everything and don't let them tell you that you just have to wait it out. Have your doctor test your thyroid because apparently this is the problem over 50% of the time, My thyroid is just fine, so I continue to look for the problem. Thankfully, my doctor is very understanding and doing everything he can to help. I live in the US, and the posts from everyone in the UK that is having to wait months to see a specialist shock me. I feel for you all. If anyone has any information regarding an autoimmune reaction or any treatments besides steroids that have actually dealt with the problem and not just the symptoms, please let me know. If anyone would like more information I found a website with a detailed article regarding treatments at medline.com then type in chronic urticaria and angioedema. Also, feel free to request my email from the moderator. Good luck to everyone out there, it is encouraging to know that I'm not the only one dealing with this."

My hands occasionally itch and my entire hand will swell to the extent that I can't bend my fingers.I had some blood tests for autoimmune disease over a year ago, after which I was told they were all normal. At that time, the doctor i saw refused to refer me to a dermatologist, instead she prescribed me three bottles of crotamiton lotion per month to try to control the itching, told me to stay indoors, wear factor 50 sunlotion and keep my body covered up all the time - very helpful!Anyway I now have a more caring doctor, and I have an appointment to see a dermatologist at my local hospital on 23rd February. I'm just wondering what to take along which might help them to help me. On the day I'm sure my rash will behave itself and will be extremely mild. I have taken photographs of it when it is particularly bad and will be able to show them.Any advice would be most welcomed.Thank you for reading.Tina"

I must stress that the below is my own experience and is not guarenteed to work on everyone:In January 2016 i started to get small/non itchy hives on my hands and arms, as the weather was cold I put it down to chillblains. After a few weeks I pinpointed the problem to changes in temperature...I.E going from cold to warm when getting home and putting the heating on. By Feb i was getting more and more annoyed so visted my GP who pescribed 180mg of Fexofenodine...this worked slightly but only for a few days! After this the symptoms got alot worse, soon i would be covered on my hands, arms, neck, shoulders and legs. Exercising was causing havoc with my skin where only minutes after getting home from the gym i would be a blotchy red mess from head to toe...i was going crazy with it!Weeks of research/ food intolerance tests/ derrmotology vists were getting me nowhere. The only glimmer of hope was the different amounts of antihistimine available that I hadnt tried so i decided to trial and error different types...until i discovered Chlorphenamine. From what I understand this is a first generation antihistamine that can have some side effects..non of which i have experienced so far. Chlorphenamine stopped the flare ups 100% and has also helped a mild rhinitis issue i have had for years. I dont plan to stay on them forever so i will keep the forum updated when I stop...but 1 month of being hive free is fantastic and i hope this can help others to."

Since then I have had non stop itching and burning to my upper thighs and upper arms (daily) other areas itch from time to time. Some days I can't even dress... it's effecting my whole life. So distressing especially now I'm a new mum even more so. Previously I was suicidal over my skin but now I have somehing to live and fight for... my son and my hubby. I'm determined to not let this beat me but can understand why people say 'a life like this isn't worth living' because I've felt like this too many times...I wasn't going to have a baby for the fear of the skin worsening,then told because of my health it'd be unlikely to conceive anyhow... last ear after getting married I got pregnant. The first 1-3 months were a nightmare unable to take antihistamines the times I did I threw up immediately like my body was rejecting them. The Dr gave me an alternative Puriton which is safe to use during pregnancy but not strong enough to use previously. .. this helped and months 3-6 (second trimester) of my preg my skin was amazing. So my questions to the Dr is what happens to your hody during these months as theres obviously a hormone or vitamin which helps as I was able to sleep,wear tight clothes leggings and jeans and just be happy! 6-9 months (third trimester) well... horrendous. Living on 3 hours sleep if that most nights my skin drove my insane to the point I was throwing up crying all the time from the pain of the itching and burning. It was so bad the end of my preg I had to start my mat leave earlier and also I came downstairs 2am one morn as I was worried my it Hong would wake hubby due to start an early work shift and where I'd got into a state I felt tingly and dizzy and fell down the stairs at 37 weeks preg on the tue... hosp declared me fine to go home after a day in hosp undergoing heck then the fri (3days later) I came over dizzy from the pressure of the itch and burning and went into labour most likely triggered by the fall down the stairs.After birth wow skin was best it's been for 12 weeks so again what happens at the point of birth to make your skin amazing with no pain or itching!? I've read every post on here and separately google every diet mentioned cream etc and am going to try everyhing. I'm currently under a dietician and we are cutting put various gongs each week to see if certain triggers make a difference. I can't understand it... everyone says I have lovely skin but it's not always something you can see. I mean my arms have red bumps under the skin which get darker and angry when having an itch attach and thr bumps then rise but the thighs mostly there's nothing to see they look normal most days even when having an itch attack.I can't bath or shower for long water triggers mine, as does my sweat, friction I. E. Changing clothes... recent tests undergone show I'm allergic to cinnamon and cinnamon in most body products however even after cutting these out there isn't a huge improvement. It effects every aspect it breaks my heart when I'm to sore to hold my 4 month old baby so have to sit him on the bed to feed him and hold him with one hand feed woth the other because sitting on my leg will cause me so much agony and pain for hours on end. I don't remember the last time I had a full nights sleep more than 4-5 hours because of the rash, I can't remember waking up and feeling non itchy othet than when I was preg!Being on holiday in a hot country Bizarly I'm norm good after 2 days but once home it starts again it's so bizarre yet if I get too hot here in the UK I get an itch attack. My colleagues moan when I open the window but sometimes I need to cool down to calm my itch. I'm currently taking 2 x citorizone twice a day morn and night and portion every 4 hrs. I don't expect a cure but somehow or anything to just be able to have a few good days and even 1 or 2 decent nights sleep a week to recharge and be able to deal with things better as being a constant zombie doesn't help, I don't know why my husband puts up with me it makes me so moody and snappy when I have an attack and effects our sex life at times when it's really bad. It started slightly prior to my thyroidectomy when diagnosed with overactive thyroid I was on carbimazole medication It seems a coincide ce to start at this point. Perhaps as some mention stress plays a part which is why some days are better or worse than others. If I won the lottery 1st thigh I'd do is get a doctor to spean a few months with me seeing how my daily life is effected to see if they can see I'm doing somehing that brings it on or not... it's just so bizarre.

However, for those like me who have achieved full or partial remission, while on or off medication, do any of you feel a lingering fear whenever you feel even an itch?For me sometimes, even though I rarely get symptoms anymore, I'm sometimes too scared to run or go in the sun for long distances, fearing that the hives might just come back and I'll be stuck far from home without anywhere to cool down. Or if I get a small itch, I start to get really anxious. One thing many CU sufferers can only relate to is that feeling, like an aura before a seizure, is this feeling you get before you itch because you feel your heart race or body temp go up. Every time this happens, I fear an itch is coming and I am relieved when nothing happens. Nevertheless, every time I get hot or excited, I still tends in anticipation.Yes I know I'm rambling. I've only been in this sweet limbo of partial/full remission for 7-8 weeks so maybe I'm still not used to being cured.For those of you who are doing well now, did you ever experience these emotional responses? If so, how did you deal?Thanks :-) "

It happened very quickly and for half a year I'd wake up covered in a rash, my face would swell occasionally, and there seemed to be no reason for it. I went to an allergist, no allergies to anything. Then in half a year it disappeared suddenly. I no more get such rashes randomly, but I discovered that I'm developing allergies to painkiller medication (tylenol/advil). Those also happened suddenly. I got sick with a fever and took a tylenol and within 20 minutes I was covered in a rash/swollen lip. I went to an allergist again, tested me, allergic to tylenol but not to advil. However, I discovered the same thing happening with advil, but when I take more than 1 pill in a small period of time (I took one yesterday, I was fine; I took another one today, but today my lip got swollen within 15 minutes).Also, I'm getting a rash when eating food that's been in the fridge for a while. Not spoiled, but sitting there for a while. This happened with a meat that I cooked, and also with a chocolate cake. There is no way in hell I'm allergic to meat/chocolate in general, I eat them all the time, and I'm completely fine (as long as they're fresh, I suppose).I haven't gone on any new medication, I don't know what is going on. The allergist wasn't able to give me any answers, only confirmed what I already knew from experience. I went in for x-ray/blood testing and I am completely healthy.I don't know what to do or to make of this. Does this mean I'm allergic to all painkillers now? What if I need a painkiller for something, or if something urgent happens, what do I tell doctors/etc? I THINK I'm allergic to MAYBE ALL over-the-counter painkillers? "

I'm not big on doctors or for that matter ER rooms. Two days later after my ER visit I visited my PCP and I was referred to a specialist. The allergist diagnosed me with chronic spontaneous urticaria or angioedema. I was given nothing but a epinephrine pen and told that there is no cure nor anything I could do to help myself. I requested testing for everything in the world via blood tests, std tests, infectious disease test, and everything came back negative. I was kind of hoping for something to come back positive so that I would know what was wrong although that wasn't the case. I'm not the type of person to tell everyone my business although hives aren't anything you can hide! While at work a woman friend looked at me and could see by my face that something was wrong. She questioned me and I told her. She stated that she had the same thing occur approximately 4 years ago and that she knew what I could take to stop the hives. I felt very exited. She also stated that after four years it still exists.This is what I started taking that ended my hives / welts: 1) Famotidine 20mg, 2 tabs twice daily (40mg twice per day) (OTC). 2am and on 2 pm.2) Zyrtec (cetirizine) 10mg, 2 tablets daily (OTC) 1 am and 1 pm.I purchased both of these pills from Costco although I'm quite sure you could buy them anywhere. For what it's worth I'm not a medical professional or in the medical field at all. I searched the Internet when the doctor gave it a name and could find nothing, I was very sad.

I've noticed that when I have breakouts thay are particularly bad, my tattoos are hives if that makes sense. The lettering and lines become extremely swollen and then the rest of my body breaks out in hives. This doesn't happen all the time, but I'm just wondering if anyone else experienced the same. There is one tattoo in particular on my foot that has a small amount of red ink, my only coloured tattoo and I'm horribly allergic to the red ink. This tattoo has bothered me for almost 4 years, and when I developed chronic urticaria, it became even more itchy and swollen. It comes and goes, and when I take my medication (300 mg Randitidine twice a day, 10 mg Montelukast once a day) it calms down and doesn't bother me at all. My tattoos have always become a little raised on particularly humid days, which is common, but before I was diagnosed with Chronic Urticaria andmy tattoos started swelling when I had hives, I became concerned. My medication usually prevents any hives or swelling of my tattoos, lips, hands or eyes, but it makes me hesitant to continue getting tattoos although I'd like to out of fear that I'll have a horrible break out during or right after I've been tattooed. I'm so frustrated with this. I wish I had have led less stressful life, or I could know whattriggered this, and I wish I could find a permanent solution to this, as I'm sure we all do. Nobody understands when I say no, I can't drink because I'll break out in hives. No, can't go out today or work out because it's too humid, and I'll get hives. I can't even wear my rings half of the time because anything tight around my skin causes hives. Break outs in public are the absolute worst, people look at me with disgust because they don't understand. I'm so tired of this. I'm a 20 year old woman and I'm afraid to go out and have a good time becAuse of this rash. I hate taking pills, I hate stressing out because I can't remember whether I took them or not.

I have to admit unashamedly that I haven't followed any illumination diet religiously because just wanted normal life!However, here I am again today off work because of bad hives and swelling! I have a few observations to put out there for comment by fellow sufferers. Has anyone else tried or heard of Salicylate? Or has any success cutting it down? It's in so many foods & products! Also some foods low in Salicylate are high in histamine so once you've compared both lists you really are not left with much!!A second thing I've realised is that my hives are really bad and treatment resistant in the lead up and during my period. I've only just put two and two together here and will be monitoring this now! My hives first came on after starting contraceptive pill, so I wonder if it's hormone related?! Anyone else found hormonal link? So here I am again feel like I'm back to square one! I guess when all you want is relief it's easy to just take the antihistamine and carry on as normal!

It was so severe that I had blisters upon blisters and eventually open sores. The hospital originally thought I had Pemphigus.The condition has hardly improved over the last 15 months despite being on 2x 180mg of fexofenadine and 2 X 10mg of cetirizine tablets per day. The medication has caused chronic fatigue, lack of bowel control and my immune system must be really struggling because I catch anything!!

I also look like an Ebola victim and am very conscious of people staring. For this reason I hardly leave the house. The condition itself causes severe blistering and scarring. The itching can be unbearable- and painful. I even scratch in my sleep so I haven't had undisturbed sleep for months and I wake up to my sheets covered in blood spots. My joints ache and I have very pronounced positive dermagraphism. I often get blisters under my eyelids which causes sight issues. I also get blisters in my throat and on 2 occasions have needed to call out paramedics because it caused swelling in my airways. Despite this I have been referred to dermatology who are treating my condition as not life threatening and have been told that they've exhausted what they can do to help me.

I'm taking 120mg of levothyroxin for the thyroid:I strongly believe that being treated in dermatology is only looking at the symptoms and not addressing the cause of this issue.I am depressed. My life has stopped. I am now, as I am everyday, sat on my bed. Confined to living a solemn and sedentary existence. I feel lazy. I feel worthless. I cannot socialize for fear of being in public. The pain is shocking. I cannot imagine the toll this has already had on my health both mentally and physically; the physical pain of an outbreak seems an entirely unnatural and extreme stressor for my body to have to deal with on a daily basis.This is such a debilitating condition and yet because it's not life threatening in itself it seems no one wants to know. Why is so little known about a disease with such devastating consequences?I need help. Prior to this happening I was a senior chartered accountant in a huge international firm. Now I am reduced to slobbing around the house. Sleeping 18 hours a day and living in fear of going out or even meeting people because I am worried about getting germs, people staring at my huge blisters oh and there's always a good chance I'll shut myself! this is a life I do not want to lead and will not continue to lead if I do not witness a significant change in my circumstance. Does anybody know if any research is being done into this condition?I am very willing to put myself forward as a test subject. This condition desperately needs to be understood and I will do all I can to further research into this field."

I tried many treatments, saline, vinegar, calimine, animine, steroid creams, epsom salts, sorbolene, pinetarsal, goat soap, four different steroid creams (all of which made the urticaria worse) along with a few other treatments I can't remember at the moment. A strong saline solution applied each morning followed by the application of sorbolene was the only treatment that relieved the itch and allowed me at least a couple of hours sleep at night; however, it did not cure the urticaria. I started on pinetarsal and ultraviolet treatment three times per week, about 6-8 weeks after deleting coversyl (BP medication) and Lipitor (statin) and within a few days the urticaria had gone, not sure which one worked or if it was the combination but it has certainly worked wonders.

Although I'm happy to have found this forum to learn from your experiences.I wonder if any of you out there have experiences methotrexate at all? If so how did you find it? Did it work for you? How about the side effects? Sorry, so many questions.I have had urticaria now for 4 years, but also suffered with excema all of my life. My eczema is usually controlled pretty well with bathing in emmollients, using moisturisers and steriod creams when flaring. As the eczema has always been there, I always thought I coped with this quite well. It's the urticaria that really gets to me. It's AWFUL!Anyhow, I have taken cyclosporine on two occasions for 3 months at a time (which worked wonders to my skin!!) however due to side effects of high blood pressure and kidney problems had to come off them. Taken azathiorine (which also worked wonders) and again, had to come off due to side effects, this time liver problems. Now I'm on waiting to start methotrexate, lets see if that works! I have had to give my liver a rest in between meds. Pretty harsh! Also tried montelukast/anti histamine combo, this didn't work for my skin. I have been taking prednisolone on and off for years but solidly for about 5 months solid now, I am so greatful for this just to be able to get by day by day, I'm trying to ignore what these might be doing to my body! I also take 2 x 180mg fexofenadine a day, also chlorphenamine for night time to sleep a bit better. I have all my fingers and toes crossed that methotrexate will be ok for me, and I don't experience side effects that badly that I have to stop taking it. I really appreciate all of what my Dermatologist has done for me, and am so greatful to for being looked after. I completely understand that finding medication that works is completely trial and error, and we are in effect guinea pigs to modern medicine. What might work for one person, won't work for someone else. What might work for your skin condition might be a problem for other parts of your body! You just don't know!Fingers crossed for third time lucky for me, I've got high hopes for this methotrexate!!

I have quite a few allergies but didn't come in contact with any of them that I could think of. I took Benadryl, sure they would go away. After three days of the hives spreading and getting worse I went to the doctor, they gave me a handful of medication including prednisone as well as a kenelog shot. A few days later the hives went down, as soon as I got off the steroids however, they all returned. Over the next five months I tried montelukast, ranitidine, multiple doses of prednisone, hydroxizine, allertec, tons of Benadryl, Claritin and many others I can't even remember the names of. Over that time I had multiple doctor visits that consisted of telling me I should have used an epi pen it was so bad and my face was so deformed with swelling, I was prescribed epi pens and on several occasions was given Benadryl shots, kenelog shots and another shot I don't remember the name of. After many doctor visits and trying different medications to no avail, I finally got the hives to offer a little relief, after getting off an extended dose of prednisone and staying up on hydroxizine four times a day, Flonase two times a day, ranitidine four times a day and allertec four times a day. Finally I saw a specialist who recommended xolair after I tested positive to an autologous serum test. I am four months into shots and I have been able to cut back on some of the medication but when I have worse days I have to bump it back up. If I fail to take my medicine for a few days the hives, itching, facial deformation, facial, lip and mouth swelling all return. My Doctor said I should be feeling better by now with xolair and so I've scheduled an appointment with him next week. I'm feeling frustrated and discouraged that it's been almost a year of this.

For a year and a half and counting!Long story: I began to get hives on my hands, feet, legs, back, after I would perform any kind of activity. Sitting in a cushion chair was ok, but if I sat on a metal bleacher, I would get raised hives that would last 1-2 days. Play golf, my hands would swell to wear I could barely hold the club by the end of the round. If it was hot, it seemed worse.Went to several doctors and allergists. Nothing conclusive and I was thoroughly tested. If something pressed upon me for any length of time, i would hive-up. So for ten years I avoided most physical activity, so as to avoid the hives. I put on a few pounds, got some bad numbers from my physical, decided to lose weight.Based on advice from a friend, I stopped eating wheat. I began losing weight steadily. After about six weeks, it began to dawn on me: I haven't had hives in a while. I purposefully went and did things that would ALWAYS cause hives, and NOTHING HAPPENED! Sometimes will binge, have some beer and pizza and a brownie or two, and yep, I'll get some hives again. Go wheat free, and they are gone.The important thing here is that my 'reaction' to wheat did NOT show up on my allergy tests. They poked my back with everything, and it was all fine.So if you think you aren't allergic to wheat, try giving it up for a while and see if you improve. Good luck, hope it works for you. It's so nice to have them gone.I don't have any other major health issues. Just hives."

He had this on and off but it got worse.We finally went to the doctor, we had a picture of the bumps and showed the doc, he thinks its hives. So he put him on 180mg fexofenadine, which to start with helped a little but now does not work as well.My son says sometimes he gets the rash but other times he doesnt, but regardless of rash or not he gets the feeling of painful needles in his skin, this lasts for around 15 or 20 mins, he can get up to about 4 attacks a day (He also suffers with anxiety a bit, and he lacks self confidence and is not very positive at all and he gets stressed)We are due to go to Majorca for a well earned family hols, but he doesnt want to go now. He recons the heat over there will make the hives even worse. He says changes in tempreture bring on the hives. I said to him ""you can either be here in the uk with your hives or in spain with the hives"". Is there anyone out there who gets moderate hives but who also went to a hotter country? Did it makes things worse for you? how did you cope? Is there anything i can do for my son to help him better deal with an attack?We are due to see the doc tomorrow cos i want him to reffered toa dermatologist and i want him to try a different antihistamine.Any help is much appreciated xxx"

Dab very salty water on rash, don't wipe off, keep doing it and the itching will ease if not go. Chaffing wheals caused by rough seams in clothes, arms, inside legs, waistline etc. Sew soft tape or ribbon along seams, alot of work but its worth it. Use silicon based creams or silicon lubricant on these areas to prevent chaffing, it works. I had a course of Ciclosporin (an immune suppressant) over 6mths which put my CIU in remission. I also was prescribed Doxepin (75mgs) which is an anti-depressant but has antihistamine also. CIU leaves you very down and in a bad place. A combination of the above and being careful not to eat too much food that is high in histamine has helped me tremendously - I hope it helps you too. I don't think I'll ever be free of CIU but as it is now I can live with it."

My CU started at the end of January, I was made redundant from my job, went down with a mild cold and a few days later the urticaria started. A few weeks later my beloved cat was put to sleep and then a month or so later my elderly father fell down stairs and was hospitalised, so emotional stress has been high.My current medication is 10mg Cetirizine and 150mg Rantidine four times a day and Montelukast at night only. Initially it responded and I would have a couple of free days a week but over the last 3 weeks it's getting worse again to the point I thought I might go mad with the itching last night. I tried a topical steroid cream which was useless so I'm persevering with calamine cream. I'm seeing a dermatologist but he's reluctant to refer me for the Xolair injections because my whole body isn't covered. Plus there's a 6 month waiting list because he'd have to refer me to the urticaria clinic in London, I live in north Hampshire and can't believe no one can do these locally! Dapsone isn't an option for me because my first blood test showed my white blood cell count and infection markers were up and it's too risky for me to take it. My second set of blood tests were normal. At the moment it's all over my legs, I can't bear anything touching my legs but have a new job in a very corporate environment so have to wear trousers or tights.I'm so desperate I've just booked to see an acupuncturist, I just don't know what else to do. My next dermatology appointment isn't until the end of June, he said an immunologist won't do anything more than he is doing.I have tried Fexofenadine but it wasn't as effective as the Cetirizine, I can't tolerate steroids either as they have me doubled over with the worst indigestion I've ever had.Does anyone have any other suggestions I could ask for I feel like I'm running out of options."

I'm 57 years old and suffered from skin conditions since birth mainly excema. The excema was mainly out grown by the time I was 21 with mini flare ups (which is tended to be called dermatitis).However, since starting the menapouse my skin has been in a terrible state which to me is a combination of both excema and urticaria. My Dr advised it was because of the menapouse the excema had come back this was over six years ago. He prescribed Cetraben and Modrasone and Diprobase which relieve the symptoms but don't cure the problem. I was also prescribed Oilatum for bathing and Oilatum shampoo and Nizoral for my scalp.However, because the Oilatum is perfumed and very oily I had to stop using it. But I did find by chance Epaderm in my local chemist which I now shower and wash my face with and is prescribed and alternate the Oilatum shampoo and Nizoral for my scalp.Even keeping my skin hydrated with emollients doesn't prevent the skin from erupting about every 4 to 6 weeks. Bright red skin from my face down to my chest and hands. Very painful and itchy like having a very severe case of sunburn and you moisturise and moisturise the skin flakes off continually until it settles and you look normal and then 4 to 6 weeks later it's off again. Anyway whilst seeing a different Dr for another problem I had an out break showed it to her and told her how it was driving me crackers and she has prescribed this antihistamine which I have been researching and this is how I found this forum. I'm sure you all know we have the physical signs of this horrible condition but we tend to be ignored or treated like a 6year old.What helps me is wearing cotton clothing as much as possible, cotton bedding, the Epaderm, Cetraben and Diprobase (not all at the same time obviously) Oilatum Scalp shampoo and Nizoral and now this new antihistamine Fexofenadine I hope. I'm only on day 2 but I'm living in hope. Best wishes to you all. "

Originally x2 daily certirizine helped, after a few weeks stopped helping, then tried cimeditine with cetirizine, again worked for 2 weeks then stopped, dermatologist prescribed high dose of fexofenadine 180mg x2 per day and hydroxozine 25mg at night... and guess what? worked for 2 weeks then hives came back. Have had 5 blissful days on steroids inbetween as I was at a point where I could no longer cope - I am back at that point! Finding it utterly debliltating, Im knackered and grumpy and also suffer from pretty bad atopic eczema which flares horrendously with the CU. I am back at dermatologist next week and when i asked last time about the plan if fexofenadine failed they said would most likely be cyclosporin - I am at a point where I am more than happy to try this and am fully aware of potential dangers of taking it, but I fear I may become depressed if this carries on!Has anyone else taken cyclosporin for CU?

Last October I started to get swelling around my eyes. It started in one eye and quickly moved to another. The doctor put it down as blephartitis and gave me steroid cream which initally helped. Very soon after I started to get urticaria all around my eyes and down my neck. they were very painful and it felt as though some one had thrown acid on my face. It was most painful around the eyes and very unsightly. It was nearly impossible to cover with make-up. When the flare up would fade it would leave hyperpigmentation until the next flare up (as many as 3 a week, each lasting a solid day). Sometimes it was accompanied with the angioedema and other times not. I was refered to an eye doctor who said he was unable to help. I was referred to a dermatologist (still waiting for that appointment!) I went back to the doctor over and over asking for various blood tests but was refused. Theywere convinced it was an allergy but I felt certain it was not. Nothing in my situation had changed. It was really affecting mylife negatively. I never left the house if I could help it. People at work began to think I was being abused due to the swelling and hyperpigmentation around my eyes. In March I ent back to the doctor and demanded some blood tests, for something, anything! She decided to humour me and ran some blood test. The Vitamin D test came back at a 9. The normal range is 75-150. A quick google search shows that vitamin D plays a role in chronic urticaria and that supplementation is a successful treatment for many people. I have been on the prescription strength Vitamin D for 2 months and as my levels slowly rose the severity and frequency of the urticaria have lessened remarkably. I have not had an outbreak for over 2 weeks now which is incredible for me. If this is not an avenue you have yet explored it is worth having the test. If I hadn't pushed for the test I would still be suffering and may have done for years."

I have also been taking a supplement called Serrapeptase which was recommended as a natural, anti-inflammatory pain relieving enzyme. If you google what is Serrapeptase you will find out more. If you decide to try then please ensure you get the ones that are ""enteric coated"" to allow them to pass safely through the stomach before dissolving as this is where they provide max benefit. They are to be taken on an empty stomach so I take last thing at night with a big glass of alkaline water.I can only tell you that lots of water and the Serrapeptase seem to have brought my skin under control and back to normal. I also read the other day that 80% of our immune system may be contained within our stomachs/intestines so I have ordered some high quality acidophilus which I will be taking to keep this as healthy and balanced as possible.Hope my insights assist and I will make sure I look out for any questions in the near future.Hope we can all find healing.Nick"

This however didn't match the description told by the dermatologist. I have since over the 7 years taken fexofenadine, loratadine, chloraphenamine and citirizine. After gaining a few stone and having toilet problems I could only put it down to my medication to which I found that citirizine which I had been on for about 4 years caused urine retention and constipation. I would wee maybe once a day and go for a poo maybe 2/3 times per week. I decided to speak to a doctor and have him change me to fexofenadine which I was previously taken off due to them becoming less effective. After switching I found that I was going to the toilet much more and lost around 2 stone. I still however get extremely irritable if I don't take some form of anti histamine it feels like I'm dependent on it however I try I reduce what I take to reduce the long term side effects.

Only one ever worked and it was called Co-Pyronal (that may not be a correct spelling), back in the mid 70's, but after 3 yrs they stopped it, saying it was cancer causing, nothing has worked since.I was told I had an intolerance to something and for all these years have tried to figure out what. The rash, though, seems to appear at random with no apparent catalyst and all efforts to isolate a cause have proved fruitless. It lasts for a random time, covers my whole body to varying degrees and makes my life miserable with chronic fatigue and itching.Some research on the net has given me an inkling about this and I now appreciate that there may be no obvious catalyst to its onset.I note however, that I seem to fall into several of the types of urticaria and therein lies my question, finally.From its onset:It always starts at the hair line/wrists and develops over time (days/weeks) to cover my entire body with each appearance.I suffer from \""pressure\"" at waist, wrists, ankles.I get a reaction, approximately 24 hrs after I sunbathe on the most exposed ares, normally chest and shoulders.It appears in the late afternoon/early evening after I have done manual work.The evening is the worst time and after being told by a Doctor many years ago to have a drink when it is bad, I have a bottle of wine when it gets too bad and that numbs the itching at least.I also discovered recently, after being prescribed Amitriptylene tablets for eye pain, that they bring on a violent reaction that lasts 24-36 hrs.It is with me again, since Xmas last year and I am so miserable. Everything I do is controlled by this ailment and the fatigue is hard to live with.Any advice/comments would be most welcome. My Doctor tells me that is a waste of time going on the list to see the one Dermatologist for the SW of England and that all I can do is keep trying Anti histamines in the hope that one will work.I am so miserable, any advice would be most welcome."

I've been to an allergist who was no hope. The dermatologist helped by changing me to different meds so now I'm on Hydroxyzine, reactine and cimetine. They are getting a bit worse again so the dermatologist said to increase the Hydroxyzine. I could but it makes me so tired the next day. I will just have to get used to it. At the time of my onset I was just recovering from surgery with cancer six months before the onset. The doctors think it has something to do with my immune system.If I don't take my medications I go crazy. Once I had to go off my meds before I'd seen the allergist.My hives look like someone has whipped me and it was soooo itchy, I can't describe it.I'm going to see my natupathic doctor who thinks it realated to candiasis. I've had an elotrodermic testing (food allery test) done and it showed I had a high level of candidas. She says candidas causes many allergies in the body. Weelllll see and I will let you know. So hang in there, I'm so glad I could talk to someone who understands.[i:6d6d7ace55]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:6d6d7ace55]"

We've tried all sorts. I want to go private but don't know where to turn. We've seen several NHS 'Consultants' who offer injections that are supposed to help - last ten years they said - it stays away for a while but its back again now - 5 times in less than 10 days. Poor mite couldn't hold a pen in school as her hand was so swollen - she gets a nasty cough which makes her sick at the same time. Can anyone offer any advices - please?

I tried everything, detoxing (helped a little bit) antihistamnes, creams, went gp a few times, tried excluding foods etc.. but nothing really helped.. then i went to see a chinese medicine doctor in Burnt Oak, London who diagnosed me and described me a mix of herbs to boil and drink for a week. (DISGUSTING) But it helped...!!!!!!!! Since i started this treatment, everyday I have seen a dramatic improvement and last night was the last cup and this morning there is not one hive in sight! FIRST TIME IN AGES... I woud REALLY recommend this as I thought nothing else would help me.. The medicine man said one thing, \""In China, if a person has prolems with the skin, he has problems with the bigger organs inside, especially the stomach\"" I think he was right...Of course if this does not help, see a doctor and be persistant...it could be more serious causes...I hope this will help someone because it has really helped me.Denise"

"Urticarial Rash","I'm male and I first developed urticara on Boxing Day 19...","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/i-m-male-and-i-first-developed-urticara-on-boxing-day-19--4690","I'm male and I first developed urticara on Boxing Day 1979 at the age of 34 having had no previous symptoms. At that time I was in the Royal Air Force, and I must say that the RAF sent me to see a number of specialist doctors both in the RAF and at Harley Street, London but the ""trigger"" was never found and my symptoms lasted until the July 1980.I was gived a list by my specialists of permitted and banned food products. This very comprehensive list was issued by the UNITED LEEDS HOSPITALS DIETETIC DEPARTMENT in the UK and consists of 9 close typed A4 pages. I'd recommend any sufferer to try to get a hold of a copy of this list as it's been a great help to me.During that time I suffered with the classical signs/symptoms of swollen red weals all over my body including my scalp, swollen lips and an incredible itch all over! At first the doctors gave me Piriton which has a yellow coating on the tablet and I proved allergic to this colouring! So Clarityn were perscribed and they seemed to help.Another attack happened during 1990 and Neoclarityn was perscribed and the symptoms came and went at irregular intervals until 1992 when they disappeared.At present,(August 2006)I have the symptoms again of red,itchy weals all over my body and tiredness. Since the 1992 attack, I've eaten every imaginable type of food without any ill effects and suddenly,without warning, urticara returned within 24 hours. So far the symptoms have lasted 7 days and show only mild relief at present with the use of Neoclarityn.For the last four days I've eaten nothing but Oatmeal Porridge with skimmed milk and laced with Acacia Blossom Honey for sweetning for each meal. (You do get a little sick of it after a while!) This is on my permitted foodstuffs list and for a drink I've only had fresh ""perked"" coffee which I grind myself (80% Java & 20% High Mountain beans), together with skimmed milk and white sugar to taste. Maxwell House and Nestcafe instant coffee's are the only permitted instant coffees on my list and all others are to be avoided! For medication,I'm taking Neoclarityn tablets every 24 hours! I'm finding taking a warmish shower twice a day does help to reduce the itch somewhat for a couple of hours or so.My wife is also baking wholmeal bread for me without adding a small amount of brown flour which one would usually use in the baking of wholmeal bread. She's just using Strong Wholmeal Bread Flour only, with the addition of dried yeast. It makes the bread a little denser and heavier, but it's on the permitted list from the hospital dietetic department and I have no adverse reaction to it. White and brown bread of all types MUST be avoided according to my permitted product list.At present my symptoms are receding somewhat and about 25% the red wealshave dissapeared although what's left are still itchy. I've still not found the ""trigger"" product yet so once this attack clears up, I'll introduce myself slowly to the permitted food products on my list and I'll stick to them for the future.I hope that these comments are of help to fellow sufferers[i:d76cbc120f]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:d76cbc120f]"

I am trying food elimination at the moment and find that any foods with colouring or artificial flavourings are definit trigger points. I am also trying to eliminate dairy products from my diet which I am sure are causing this problem but its not easy as I am a chef.Otherwise I do not know what to do next I had seen consultants in the 90s but they couldnt offer any help so I can only try food elimination.[i:6b6b652d6e]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:6b6b652d6e]"

On Easter sunday, this year, after being outside, she started to turn red then purple in coloring and then the hives came,1000's of them all over her. I thought it was anaphalaxis. the doctor said give her benedryl, I did and they went away.then it happened 2 more times. she started carrying her epi-pen around like the holy-grail. after multiple test we found out that its not anaphalaxis, but even after it has happened 6 more times they keep giving her benedryl on top of zyrtec. shes either iching or sleeping. we are getting no answers because the specialist hesitates to diagnose her with cold Urticaria, because it is so rare. if you put ice on her she gets hives what more proof do they need. shes afraid and depressed and the school doesn't want her there cause they don't want the responsibility. I feel so helpless.this should be the happyest time in her life instead shes debating on not going to prom. but,now I can show her this website so she will know she is not alone!!!!!!!!!
