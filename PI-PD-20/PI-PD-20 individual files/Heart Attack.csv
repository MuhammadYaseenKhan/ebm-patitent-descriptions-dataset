Heart Attack,Heart palpitations and difficulty breathing.,"Hi I am 21 years old I do not have any diseases and no family history for heart diseases even my grandfathers and grandmothers and I am a bodybuilder. My problem started when I read on the internet about vaping could cause difficulty breathing and I started feeling heavy breathing then I thought that there is a problem with my heart finally I thought that I have anxiety and stress that causing my difficulty breathing all the day but I think it is not from anxiety. My heart beat fast and uncomfortable and I breathe like half breathe. I feel really anxious and stressed because of that. I did echo test, ECG several times, spirometry test , blood test , X-ray several times and pules oximeter all of them came back normal.I feel really bad after I eat and I feel my stomach is not comfortable at all and when I try to breathe throw Diaphragm the difficulty breathing increase. The food immediately goes back to my throat even water. There is a lot of gas in my stomach and no appetite for food at all. All what I think of are my stomach and breathing. Finally, when I move really slightly my heart beat faster and uncomfortably even when I stand up I feel  bad and anxious. Al day I think  about my heart and breathing. My blood pressure is normal also."
Heart Attack,Chest Pain/Shortness breath Symptoms; What scan would you get next?,"Hello all,I’m a 24 y/o male and would really really appreciate some input on what exam I should get next. I’ve asked the same question to my PCP and Pulmonologist but would prefer a wider array of opinions to then present to them for consideration. PLEASE, I don't mind anyone not wanting to read this much but don't jump to ""Chest pain & labored breathing? Go see a doc ASAP"". I can already hear someone projecting it as I click submit ?I’ve been experiencing sporadic shortness of breath, heart palpitations though very seldom lately and mostly just during hard workouts now, pain in left chest area upon deeper inhales and exhales, can guarantee pain upon each inhale if I’m breathing a chemical in the air like acetone or rubbing alcohol, Other chest pain that produces a pressure-pain to left of sternum during certain workouts usually more prevalent the harder the pump, more prevalent pain in lung/sternum area and breathing gets tight when just slightly dehydrated. Also sometimes feels like the left lung isn’t wanting to contract for a fulfilling breath. This next symptom hasn’t persisted lately but dealt with it for like 4 months - feeling like I sometimes can’t get a smooth food/water swallow in like it keeps allowing some down wrong tube and being a catalyst for left lung pain.So to offer context, I don’t have a lot of money and therefore have had to do my own due diligence then bring it to my 2 doctors so we can put our heads together. I acquired my medical MJ card January 2019 and began smoking and dabbing 2-3 times daily 4-7 times a week. Developed some very bad lung and bronchial issues come November and stubbornly quit like 3-4 weeks after pain began. It got really bad with constant labored breathing unable to get a few words out between air gasps. Had sharp pain in left lung and right in symmetrical areas as well as bronchials (left bronchial and right lung pain out above bc/ it only persists on left side now).. I had even less $ then so jumped on medical recommendations for COPD patients. So lung damage is a certainty and clearly improving over time.But that leaves the heart palps, pressured chest pain, and occasional labored breathing despite being fully hydrated up for question. Also can’t be certain that weaker contractions in left lung are lung damage or pulmonary valve related. Damage to pulmonary valve could easily lead to all symptoms. A pericardial effusion could lead to many of them. Iron overload could lead to all and I noted less symptoms after a blood drawing more than once now. I also follow a strict diet for other reasons that include organs - cow liver, kidney, and heart all with sufficient iron in them and have followed it awhile now. Or it could simply be the lung damage symptoms compounding with my back issues/scoliosis as my left rib and sternum are clearly protruding more than right side as scoliosis slowly develops and the pressured chest pain is most prominent with chest-related workouts. So many things to consider unfortunately ?.I’ve had an iron panel blood test and all levels are normal though I’ve seen rare cases on the internet of people with normal iron serum levels still having organ iron overload so while in the back burner, I can’t fully exclude it.Also just had my first imaging, a CT scan w/out contrast of chest. Report said “No mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy. There’s a trace pericardial effusion, and there is fluid in superior pericardial recess & superior aortic recess. Limited views of the upper abdomen are unremarkable. There is a benign 1 mm subpleural nodular density in the left lower lobe (series #4, image #45). The lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The osseous structures are intact”Which ultimately leads me to the question I came to ask! With all that context, what next scan should I seek to rule out as many potential causes as possible? Would a chest MRI show lungs & heart? Or would that be redundant with the CT scan for any possibility outside of heart iron overload? Any other ideas or input are also appreciated ?. Thank you for bearing with the lengthiness!"
Heart Attack,Please help! What does minimal ST depression in inferior leads mean on an ECG?,"My mother is 60 years old and went to the ER for chest discomfort. They did blood work to check the heart enzymes, which came back fine, and this ECG which stated ""minimal ST depression in inferior leads"" and that it was abnormal. She has a stress test and an echocardiogram June 2nd. Can anyone offer some insight? Is this always a serious matter? My mom is making herself sick over it. Her anxiety is through the roof, and her doctor isn't helping too much with info. "
Heart Attack,Heart rate ,"I'm a 61 year female, overweight  but have lost 34pounds  recently, well done me, a few weeks  ago started to to do a bit if excercise and my heart rate would go to about 106 - 110 after about 10 minutes, now I only have to wall around the house  and can shoot up to this, just bathed my dog and it went to 121 but soon recovers to its normal level  which is about middle  60s, I dont smoke or drink, any advice  please"
Heart Attack,Scary heart palpitations! Pleasee help :((,"Hello, so I'm 17 and have been dealing with highly uncomfortable palpitations for the past couple of weeks. They get especially aggravated when I go on walks; I can feel flip flops, skips, pauses and strong thumps sometimes multiple in a minute and usually not that far from each other. They're making life really difficult to live but everyone around me keeps telling me I'm fine when I feel miserable.  I can't do the things I normally do like walk and take regular showers because the palpitations are easily triggered by these things and I'm constantly worried about my heart. To give you more perspective my palpitations feel mostly like pvcs and pacs; a fluttering, pause, skip, or individual big thump sensation. They've been happening frequently and they exhaust me.  I went to a cardiologist this week who did a brief ECG and said everything looked normal, but I'm not comforted. They didn't catch me during an episode. I'm getting more and more uncomfortable with the coming days and all I feel is panic and worry. There is a slight ache in my chest and I can't help but panic and feel there is something wrong with me. I want to do an echo, holter, and stress test but the holter isn't available and I'm afraid an echo and stress test will be too expensive. I'm terrified. I also get my wisdom teeth out in a day and have no clue how my body will react to anesthesia especially with these new palpitations... I can't put off the surgery because my teeth are in a pretty severe state and are causing pain.  What is wrong with my body??? Please...Anything helps. Thank you so much."
Heart Attack,Chest pain cycling,"I was riding my bicycle, and a light, cold wind was blowing. When I returned home, I was directly confronted with the cold wind and I started to breathe even more, about 1km or 0.6mile before I got home. and the left ear, I will also underline the parts where I had pain you had a little bit in the left cheek and in the arm, in the arm and cheek pain was easier while in the ear and chest it was stronger, then I panicked and I stopped breathing because I was afraid of a heart attack, until I got home then after I entered the house the pain started to disappear, I could still feel if I was shaking"
Heart Attack,Has anyone had a stress test while newly diagnosed with hyperthyroid?,"My mom is scheduled for a stress test this Tuesday. She recently went to the ER for chest discomfort and had an abnormality on her ECG - ST depression in inferior leads. She has been so worried over that and has also found out her thyroid levels are off - overactive. Well, she was reading about how stress tests can be dangerous when you have hyperthyroid. She isn't being treated for it as of yet. Her doctor wants to re-check in 3 weeks to see if her levels go back to normal before referring her to a specialist since it has done this once before."
Heart Attack,Heart palpitations // Anxious!!! Any help?,"Hello! I'm 17 and just recently started feeling palpitations more often. I noticed them more when I would go on walks. They usually feel like a pause, and then a bigger thump, a fluttering feeling, or a skipped beat. They're really scary and I panic every time I feel them, though I can still feel them sometimes when I think I'm relaxed.  I recently went to a cardiologist, who did a brief ECG and the results came back normal. They had said palpitations can be related to stress and anxiety, and even if they did pick up on a palpitation like the ones I'm describing, they don't treat them. They gave me some stress management tips and told me to try magnesium. They also said that they didn't want to do an echocardiogram because they're expensive and it's a lot of money to spend for finding something normal. They also said it wouldn't be dangerous to exercize. I've been scared to start exercizing again because I'm afraid I'll feel them again or they'll get worse. I get scared I'll have chest pains or feel like I can't breathe, and when I panic I can sometimes have those sensations and not know the difference between a real problem and anxiety. I know I should be comforted by hearing that everything looks normal but all I feel is panicky and constantly worried that something is wrong that I don't know about, or that something really bad could happen. I don't really know what to do. Anything to help me feel more comforted? Thank you so much! ??"
Heart Attack,Having trouble breathing + body jumps with shock,"Hi,Usually when I am ill i just put up with it and wait for it to pass but for the past few weeks I have felt my health get worse and worse pretty rapidly. I am obese and although I dont know my exact weight i know it is over 160kg.About a year ago I went to AnE because I had a tight chest with pains in my heart and a heavy left arm with pains but after having an ECG + blood test  + xray + blood preasure they said that it didnt show any signs of a heart attack. I had the same intense pains about a week ago and went back to AnE but the results came back the same.The main issue I have now is that ever since I went to the hospital a couple of weeks ago everytime I lay down to go to sleep on a night I have trouble breath and I feel like my heart is skipping beats and on top of that sometimes if I feel like I skip quite a few beats my body all of the sudden jumps and I gain pains that shoot though my whole body for a few seconds which makes me scared to lay down and try sleep to be honest I am sat here at 1:30am typing this out.One more thing I have just remembered is light  headedness sometimes i feel like I'm not getting enough oxygen to my brain as I go really light headed and dizzy and my vision seems cloudy.Now obviously a lot of these issues will be linked to my weight and I have been so scared that I have been taking action to lose weight over the past 2 week but I am more worried about the short term potential issues with my heart and breathing and just wondered if any of the things I have described ring any alarm bells as will take months if not over a year to improve my weight to a reasonable amount and at the moment I feel like I dont have anywhere near that amount of time unless these issues start to go away."
Heart Attack,Can you get heart murmur from stressing? ,"Hi everyone,Since April I started to feel a pressure on the left side and started to lose quite a lot of hair. So I went to check it out, they only discovered a physiological heart murmur and they did the typical blood work and ekg. Everything was normal and my thyroid level was also in the normal levels but they noticed I had slightly higher heart resting rate than what I normally have.I can't know if I feel more tired or get more exhausted because since I got hyperthyroid, I had trouble with always feeling exhausted and don't have a lot of energy as I had before.  So I get easily breathless when I'm really tired which is totally normal for me because I always feel tired. So some days I feel more tired than other days.So if you get heart murmur as adult and never had it before, can it be just because of stress or is there something else that can cause it? Is it normal for adults to get heart murmurs, I'm 23 years old.But I haven't felt more stress than what I normally do."
Heart Attack,Aortic valve leak,"Years ago i had this aortic leak, with an audible murmur and wide pulse pressure. I could easily see the leak on doppler echo cardiogram. Diastolic was less than half systolic e.g. 130/ 60. That was like, seven years ago and i lost interest in it.Recently i had a load of tests prior to hip replacement. There was no murmur ,and the pulse pressure is now normal.This condition  does not resolve itself i am told ,so my question is..is this a miracle?"
Heart Attack,Trying to self-diagnose,"I have been dealing with an abusive relationship with an ex who tried to induce heart attacks after a temporary period of him taking out life insurance (associated with his work) and my first heart attack at 31 and after I requested a separation to save my own life. I have had about five very painful heart attacks over the past five years but several silent myocardial infractions.  My initial lay person assessment is that this is ventricular fibrillation with STEMI but I am not an expert. It is associated with severe temperature intolerance (I cannot handle temperatures above 65 degrees unless I have wine in my system) I've attached images of my ECG before and after three glasses of wine. (the extreme crazy ecg is before and normal is after) It is the only thing that fixes my heart rate...I flatline without it, literally and would like to replace this with something healthier as it ages me. Without wine, my resting heart rate is 219, and then will titrate in a second to 30. I likely had my first heart attack at 4 during a heat wave  (very bad parents who never did anything about it despite the school calling and telling them) and have had a congenital heart condition likely my entire life. I'm trying to figure out whether I need warfarin or a stent so I can stop drinking wine. The medical care has been extremely poor in my area and my middle eastern husband has family in medicine...there is likely an association (he has threatened that) I don't drink enough to have a hangover and hard alcohol makes it worse, wine much better. Every time I try to stop  I end up in the ER with a major heart attack...much worse than the silent MI's I have recorded. Anyone have an idea as to whether this is thick blood or a-fib? I am concerned a stint could cause a clot. My biggest concern is that every time I have heart problems the EKG does not even record (I have alive cor) and the bad ecg's are not registering...only the good one did. "
Heart Attack,Heart rate spikes with the slightest exertion. ,"For the last year (maybe longer) I've been having 'episodes' of ridiculously high heart rate. My resting heart rate, according to my Apple Watch, is between 55bpm and 90bpm, which is fine. When I'm just sat in bed, in one position, I'm fine. But the minute I move my body (even just going from laying on my back to laying on my side) my heart rate will spike to 140bpm upwards.Things like walking up the stairs, doing the dishes, even just standing up, will make my heart rate spike at least 35bpm every time. It's normal for your heart rate to go up, and it wouldn't worry me as much but I also get breathless (as if I'd just finished a run, and need a second to catch my breath) and I get lightheaded. The lightheadedness varies from lasting a few seconds when I stand up (common for a lot of people, I'm told) to full on being unable to hear/see due to dizziness or actually passing out. My heart feels like it's beating so strong it'll fall out of my chest, and there have been times when I can feel my pulse in my lips or ears. My heart rate only stays high for about 2-3 minutes maximum and I have to stop whatever I'm doing and sit down usually in order for it to slow down, but the breathlessness can last for 5 minutes onwards, depending on if I sit down and rest or keep going with whatever task I'm doing (like walking).I carried a bag with 2 books in and a small bottle of fanta upstairs the other day any my heart rate was 170bpm.It's beginning to really worry me, mainly because I can't do things any more. I can't walk my dog without feeling dizzy and weak and my heart rate jumping up. It's ridiculous.I went to the GP a year ago and he checked my pulse routinely and it came back as 145bpm while I was sat down and he promptly told me to go to the hospital. They wanted to give me a heart rate monitor thing to wear for a set amount of time to see what my heart was doing during these spikes (since the ECGs I have had done came back normal), but I was moving country and thus couldn't do it. I'm back now but with the COVID-19 stuff, I can't get into see my GP again.I was just hoping for some ideas, advice, suggestions? I know the best person to talk to about it is my GP, but some clarity or vague idea or what it could be would be nice in the meantime.For reference, I'm a 23 year old female. I don't exercise intensely, but I do walk as much as I can and I am fairly active during the day, and I eat relatively healthily. With this, it's hard though."
Heart Attack,Heart Palpitations/PVCs are ruining my life HELP,"I've had heart palpitations for about 7 years now. I'm not talking about my heart randomly racing. I mean there is a noticeable flutter, skipped beat feeling. It feels like something is kicking my heart from inside it. It feels like my heart ""pops"". It's torture. Sometimes its worse than others: sometimes I can't sleep, or even sit down. I want to stress the fact that my heart rate is not high. It's usually around 60. Yet the palpitaitons still happen. So it's not like I'm having panic attacks or being nervous or anything. I've tried everything to try to get them to go away, including beta blockers, flecainide,  magnesium, and other home remedies. Nothing works. I had an ablation a long time ago, which didn't really do much, and cardiologists recommend I don't try it again. Most of these medicines, like beta blockers, slow down the heart. Again, I don't need my heart rate lowered, it's at about 60. I'm suffering every day. I'm out of options. I'm not considering suicide, but eventually that might be my only viable option. I cannot live like this forever. I just can't, and I'm out of options and out of hope. So I don't know how much longer I have before I go over the edge. I can;t sleep anymore without taking a xanax. I'm probably addicted to it now, that's just great. I can't sleep, sit down and watch a movie, or have any sense of comfort. No one knows what to do. Get a heart transplant? I probably wouldn't even qualify as this isn't ""life threatening."" I don't know if I'm here to ask for help or just to vent, because I'm sick of people giving me recommendations when I have tried every one of them unsuccessfully. Death is slowly becoming my only option, no matter how it comes"
Heart Attack,I've been suffering from exhausting palpitations for 6 months. ,"Hello there everyone, I'm new to this forum. Like I mentioned in the title I've been suffering from palpitations. I went to 5 different cardiologists this far. Done ecgs, ekgs, holter. I'm 23 years old female 5.8ft, 114 pounds. The tests result was sinus tachycardia ranging from 120-175 bpm.I also went to a gastroenterologist since  I've been experiencing gas and heartburn for the past 2 months he did an abdominal ultrasound and blood tests, nothing unusual came out. He could only see and feel some trapped gas. All the cardiologists and the gastroenterologist ascribed the palpitations to panic disorder. I was prescribed Zebeta b blocker 5mg. I have to admit I've always been an anxious person and I've experience panic attacks in the past. But they were all because of my high heart rate I was scared of fibrillating and dropping dead. My dad's brother died from a heart attack at 24 before our eyes so his untimely death  has traumatised me. For the past 2 months I wake up in the dead of night experiencing rapid heart rate 160bpm (my blood pressure is normal by the way I have slight hypotension.) It happens almost every night doctor persists its nocturnal panic. But that's not the end. My heart rate spikes no matter what i do. In the morning I have to wait for like 40 minutes to use the bathroom because If I stand up  as soon as I wake up my heartbeat will go crazy. Warm showers also seem to raise my heart rate. I've also quit working out because of those damn palpitations. Can someone help me I don't know what this is. Doctors haven't helped me so far. It's got to the point where I'm partially homebound. I even had to drop out of college because I would get those episodes every day."
Heart Attack,Can this be a heart related issue?,"To start things off, I am 22 y.o male, 1.73cm and weigh 70 kgs (155 pounds). I do have fast heart rate most of the time and have been to over 7 different cardiologists and spent so much money on doing tests, I have had over 30 Ecg's done, over 15 echos, 2x stress tests, a 24h monitoring, every time they told me to chill, to take it easy as my heart is healthy, every time they blamed it on anxiety. I've always feared heart attacks or strokes or heart failures, and the last cardiologist said that I have more chances of dying from a car hitting me outside than from my heart. I do not exercise, smoke 2 packs of cigarettes a day and my diet isn't the healthiest. Here is the picture of my recordings today."
Heart Attack,High heart rate during the day but normal at night. ,"I'm male, 28 years old, 183 cm and 74 kg. Not overweight but I have been physically inactive the last couple of years. I have a fitbit and in the last couple of years my stepcount per day was around 5000-6000 steps. This is largely from using the public transportation and just walking around the house or at work.My resting heart rate is around 100 during the day. Sometimes a bit over sometimes a bit under. Every type of exertion makes my heart rate shoot up. Even stretching to get my water bottle of the table can make it go up by 20 or more bpm. Walking at 4 or 5 km/h can make it go around 150. Running/walking up the stairs or cycling can make my hr go up to 170-200 bpm.I measured my hr at night and during sleep with a polar hr strap and my hr was somewhere between 55-80 at night while awake and somewhere between 45-55 when at sleep. However even at night with every slight exertion it can shoot up by 20 or more beats per minute. I also noticed some spikes to about 110 bpm during sleep. This might be because I moved during my sleep.I did visit a cardiologist and had an ecg, echo, bloodwork and thoraxphoto done which all came back fine. So basically the cardiologist told me that my heart is normal and the fast hr is just something that is a part of me.However I'm still concerned about this. I can't get it of my mind to the point that I am a bit anxious to start exercising. Questions:Can a fast hr like mine be harmful in the long run?Could this be IST or POTS?What other possible causes could there be?Are hr reducing pills beneficial to me?"
Heart Attack,experiencing several PVCs every minute for 24hours..... help im so scared!!,"so i was admitted to hospital last night with constant PVCs (extra heart beat) every 20 30 seconds i feel a thud and a fluttery feeling, it showed up as PVCs, 2 quick heartbeats a long pause and then a thud and a flutter feeling, it seems to be happening more when im stressed like when i was falling asleep i didnt really notice it and now im fully awake panicking i feel them every 10 to 20 beats its so distressing, in hospital they did a ecg which showed a PVC and a pause, im 22 year old male, my BP is usually anywhere from 120-140 over 80-90 but when i first got told i had to go hospital on my own (i suffer with agoraphobia and anxiety when alone) my BP was 169/111 and when i got to hospital it was 146/96, they did blood tests and nothing abnormal apparently but surely having several PVCs a minute isnt normal? has anyone ever experienced this? if so how often do you feel a PVC and how long do the episodes last??"
Heart Attack,Sudden heart rate elevation,"Greetings,I am 36 years old male with normal body weight and without any known condition. Some years ago I found out that I am a carrier of a rare genetic mutation which can lead to cardiomyopathy. We were surprised since no one has ever had heart issues or dies suddenly in our family. So far I am disease free. I have noticed that the smallest thing I do my heart rate goes crazy high immediately. For example if I go our running my heart rate can climb to over 190 bpm. I get tired and out of breath very fast, but no chest pain. If I stop it does come down within seconds max 1 min. Do you find such high rate as normal? I have a fitbit which shows that throughout 24 hr my resting heart rate is around 67. I am afraid to do the smallest activity because as I said the heart rate goes immediately high. Any recommendations? Thank you"
Heart Attack,Heart problems/strange sensation at night heat racing with sort of pain in chest.?,"i have been diagnosed with hypertonic cardiomyopathy.on beta blockers etc.This sensation that i get,is very difficult to describe,but all i can say,is that it feels like pressure ,on my chest.It only happens occasionally,maybe once a week,but is very distressing,and when it happens,i cannot put my head down,and have to stay upright.any ideas?regards, Richard"
Heart Attack,Felodipine,"Has anyone experienced joint and muscle pain on this drug?  I have been taking it for 3 months.  At first, I had quite dramatic facial flushing as well as swollen ankles at the end of the day.  This swelling has continued, but not the flushing.  The joint, firstly in the right shoulder and then more generalised started gradually but is increasing together with lower back pain.  Sleep is difficult due to pain.  The drug has lowered my BP."
Heart Attack,Daughter complaining of heart issues,"I have a 16 year old daughter. She has recently asked me if she could have a heart issue and I asked her why, she said that she feels a flutter every once in a while or something that feels like something rushing through her heart. I thought that she was out of shape, (she is 5'5"" and 134 pounds) but yesterday I heard her telling her sister that when she goes up of down stairs she could hear her heart beat and it had skipped a beat. Her sister didn't believe her and had her run in place and then held her hand to my 16 year old daughters chest and then gasped and laughed and said ""I thought you were lying!"" I don't want to ask my daughter about it to worry her. Is that normal?"
Heart Attack,Woman 36 Acute Cardiac Syndrom,"Hello,Woman 36 wakes up at night with chestpain and pressure + tingling left side chest from belly uptill shoulder + left arm.Repeating in the afternoon calling ambulance where this ECG is from.What can we see in this ECG?"
Heart Attack,What could be the cause of my near faint? ,"So, I am 25 and this has happened three times in my life.The first time, I woke up feeling faint, notice my heart rate was very slow, I had jelly legs, I went to the toilet and the poop was like dihorreah. The night before I was fine. This lasted for around 10 minutes, I didn't faint, and afterwards I was fine.Forward several years, and I wake up one morning fine. I then (I think) go to the toilet. It was the day I was coming back from holiday, so sat down, then starting to feel what I can describe as fuzzy headed/unwell. Color had apparently drained from my face etc. Noticed sensations in my stomach. Felt ill. Then over a period of 30 to 40 minutes it got worse and I began to spin. By this time we were in the car on the way home. We stopped, and by the time the door was open, I felt okay again and I  was normal after this. As I started to spin, I did notice a thud in my chest, like my heart had missed a beat.Ten months later, I wake up, go to the toilet, poop was like diarrhoea again. During the bowel movement I feel this strange indescribable sensation in my stomach. Over then next 40 minutes, my legs turn to jelly, I become quite agitated, legs turn to jelly, colour drains from my face, and I feel quite sick/ill. I again begin to spin. On this occasion, I had started to walk to the bus stop to walk, I had to stop walking because my legs went to jelly. Then I begin to spin very fast. I notice the thudding in my chest, and my heart beat is very slow and i think irregular. I lose partially my sight. This went on for 5 or so minutes, then it stopped and I was fine afterwards, if a little shaken. I am scared to visit a doctor. Yes, I know I should.I am certain it is a problem with my heart. So what could it be?I do sometimes feel extra/skipped beats when at rest which cause me to take notice of them. They last for a split second. They don't happen every day. They are not becoming more frequent or worse.Thanks for any help!"
Heart Attack,Positional heart arrhythmias,"so when i sit down fast, kneel down, bend down, stand up or lay down my heart starts to beat very forcefully and i can feel it in my throat and chest and i feel short of breath. but my heart rate does NOT increase it stays the same or gets slower just each beat is extremely forceful?"
Heart Attack,anyone know what arrhythmia i just captured ?!?,"just captured this with a Kardia by Alicecor, any ones know??"
Heart Attack,Slight movements causes a spike in heart rate? Normal?,"so I've had countless ecgs and BP checks and everything is considered normal.. anyways if I'm lying in bed my heart will usually be around 65 to 80,if I'm watching tv it's like 75 to 80 but if I'm completely relaxed and really tired it's like 65bpm but if I move my leg or arm or change my body slightly at all my heart spikes to like 90-100 for like 10 seconds and drops again.. is this normal? it also happens when I sit forward,it will raise and drop abit pretty much instantly.. also when I stand it goes upto 110-120bpm and within 30 seconds it stays at like 95 bpm if I'm standing still and stays around 110-120bpm if I just walk to the toilet or just casually walk around my house,if I go up the stairs it's like 140bpm is this normal? help I'm very afraid.. doctors wont listen, everything is apparently anxiety because bloods ecg BP are fine.. anyone experience this?"
Heart Attack,Why is my heart beat so uncomfortable?,"So I'm having some weirdness with my heart. I thought it had to do with anxiety, but it happens even when I'm perfectly calm, relaxed, or happy. Background: I'm a 21 year old female. I drink extremely rarely and exercise fairly rarely as well but walk every day and do work a sedentary job.Here is what I feel:-(happened once) I was getting up from sitting down alone, and I felt the craziest pressure in my entire chest. It was like the wind got knocked out of me and I couldn't breathe for about three seconds. Then my vision started to go back. Not spotty like when you get up too fast. It was slow and just darkness.-(happened once) not sure if it's related because I was very sick at the time. But I was in a room of people and started seeing black again. Then I couldn't hear, it felt like someone had their hands over my ears. I got really dizzy and then nauseous and then got actually sick to my stomach.-(happens often) I find myself often with an accelerated heart beat. Typically I when I measure it, it's between 100-140. During these times I might just be sitting, at work, walking the dog, etc. Nothig highly active that should cause this.-(happens often) I almost feel like my heart flip flops. The closest thing I can compare it to visually is a fish out of water. It literally feels like my heart is almost twitching.-(happens every so often) it almost feels like my heart skips a beat. So instead of being consistent there is just an awkward pause for a second and then the first beat back is hard.-(happens often) I am extremely aware of my heart beat. Again, without exercise but I feel it in my chest, other times I feel it in my arms and legs, or feel it in my face and ears.-(happens every so often) I sometimes feel pain that is in my ribs or breast on the left side. I think. I don't think it's my heart feeling pin but I don't know.The only instance that was ever even remotely painful in my heart was the first one. But there is definitely discomfort and I'm extremely aware. I don't have health insurance right now (just switched jobs and it's a complicated situation) and I don't want to seem like a hypochondriac. Any thoughts or advice would be great."
Heart Attack,Upper left back and chest pain causing extreme anxiety,"Hello,I am 22 years. I am in extreme anxiety. For the past few weeks, I have been getting this Upper left back pain that radiates to left breastbone. I am not sure if it is a normal muscular pain or a heart problem. I do not have any other specific symptoms however, I feel I do get chest pain as well. I would really appreciate if someone can reply to my post.  Thank you for your time."
Heart Attack,"I suffer from low heart rate ,as low as 38bpm ,am not the fittest person ,any1 else suffer this","ive had ecg etc an had cardiologist say my heart is fine not fittest of guys ,occasional walk 4/8mile daily ,when resting 38bpm, ranging up2 90bpm any1 else suffer from this or experience this"
Heart Attack,random fast heartbeat / palpitations when resting- do I go doctors?,"SORRY FOR THE LONG READ!I'm an 18 year old female, relatively healthy now but a bit unfit.I go out drinking maybe a couple/few times a month at best, last autumn/winter i had one cigarette a week and smoked socially but i stopped after a couple of months, because smoking is awful for health and i didnt want to become addicted. I also smoked marijuana a couple of times just to experiment, but stopped because my body reacted badly to it.so my issue is a bit complicated-for the past few months, ive been having two types of heart palpitationsthe first type im used to, as i get when im anxious about something. this type i can easily rationalise because i know its just stress causing it.the second type is what im concerned about. for some reason i'll randomly get a fast heartbeat, usually occuring when im resting, it'll start beating super fast and last for about 10 mins before it goes back to normal. Other symptoms that sometimes accompany this is slightly pulsating vision, but i dont tend to feel lightheaded or anything. The one measurement ive done during these palpitation was around 120-130bpms, BUT as i dont want to make myself anxious and in turn make them worse, I tend not to record them.i get this second type extremley intensley the day after drinking a alcohol.i get this as well after walking up stairs and doing physical activity but im pretty sure thats just me being unfit!due to other concerns with my health (i was having digestive issues as well as chest pain which i now put down to precordial catch syndrome as that pretty much makes sense), I've had two ECGs over the past few months, and both have been fine! i know this pretty much reassures it, but my concern is that these ECGs havent been done when im actually getting the palpitations, therefore I cant fully know what's going on when I get them.my main problem with going to the doctors is that i dont want to waste their time. due to my other previous issues, I don't want to look like im wasting the service, especially as i've already had two ECGs!also, im a uni student and my local GP service is awful. Appointments are usually two weeks at best and so i dont want to book one if its not worth it but at the same time dont want to ignore it if it is a problem!has anyone had a similar experience/ got some advice?thanks"
Heart Attack,"I get up at night to pee &gt; HEART palpitations, feels funny &gt; takes time to sleep again. Why?","Hi,I generally have a small bladder.If I drink a protein shake, coffee, I go to pee (clear) after 15-20 minutes, normal, I know.But if I drink some extra water at night before sleeping (or eat some watery fruit), I absolutely DO wake up  after sleeping for 2-3 hours.Again, that's normal, I know.BUT... when i get up, pee and come back, my HEART starts PALPING, pulse is a bit high (90-100), and heart feels funny, uneasy.This goes for about 15-30 minutes so I can't fall asleep immediately. But after that, I can clearly sense that the heart feel comfortable again, no palps, it's calm, I can fall asleep.OTHER INFO:  No pain, no angina, no irregular pulse. I lift weights (intensely) 3-4 days/week so my BP/blood sugar is very normal at 115 over 65-70. My pulse is usually around in the high 70s to mid 80s during working hours, and low 70s when waking up.What could this be? Is it just the sudden getting up in the middle of sleeping that's making the heart race? Whom (IF) do I see since most Docs take BP and on seeing 110-115 and 60-70 and seeing that I am very fit otherwise, don't look that much in detail."
Heart Attack,What causes heart rate Fluctuations? ,"Hi i'm a 22 male with bad anxiety, im waiting to have a heart monitor fitted for a day because i was recently emitted to hospital, they didn't find anything, my heart rate and BP was high but they put it down to stress but want to check everything. ****anyways, my heart rate at rest goes up and down all the time, its 70 and next minute its 100 and drops back down and then goes back up, i tried googling but there doesn't seem to be a actual answer to it, it doesn't seem to understand my google search and just comes up with tachycardia. Is this serious? i feel breathless most of the time and tingly and shaky and its really getting me down now."
Heart Attack,Help with undiagnosed symptoms please guys,"Hi all,I am hoping somebody reading this can offer the benefit of their own experience to help me understand what is happening with me. Here goes...March Last year I experienced several episodes of vertigo and aching between my shoulder blades. This lasted on and off for six weeks. I was sent for echo cardiogram, ecg and stress test all after symptoms had subsided (nhs waiting lists...) and i passed them all no problems found.August this year I had a major episode of a sense of doom followed by an adrenaline rush and palpitations (no pain). over the next few weeks I began having several episodes of vertigo and ill feeling that sent me running to a and e convinced I was having a heart attack or going to have one. My bloods and ecg all came back clear. I have since had a build up of symptoms of chest pain (central and to the left rib cage) pains in between my shoulder blades, my left shoulder and down my left arm. I have had a pain that runs from my chest to my right thumb and up to my chin. the left side of my neck gets stiff (comes and goes) and aches up to the left of my lower jaw. I have upper abdominal pain and fleeting waves of an acidic feeling in my stomach (comes and goes) I feel like I dont get a satisfying breath on my left side often. When I exert myself I have the vertigo episodes accompanied by a hot/cold straining heavy pain in both shoulders that stops me in my tracks. This only lasts a few seconds and goes away leaving me feeling really crap. The last time this happened two days ago for a few hours I had a feeling of hot/cold semi numbness in the left side of my head my left shoulder arm and ribcage. ECG has been fine, another echo 3 weeks ago was fine and a holter monitor has shown nothing although I had no major episodes whilst wearing it. I was discharged from cardiology 3 weeks ago on the strength of these tests but im not convinced this isnt my heart. I have asked to be refered back to cardiology but cant get an appointment until feb 2017. Iam considering going private and requesting a ct angiogram. this has been going on for over 3 months now. can anybody offer any similar experience. your help would be much appreciated.thanksDean"
Heart Attack,First pace-maker check-up and optimising settings advice.,"Had dual lead St Jude PM fitted 12 weeks ago for Heart Block, after fainting during exercise. 40yo, otherwise very fit and active (competing athlete).Initially set to DDD, but for some reason, in the first week it kept pacing me at exactly 120bpm for long periods (did it for 8 hours one day) which was distressing and uncomfortable. It was difficult to get this message across to my doc (they tried to convince me it was AF), but eventually they set it to VVI (or VVI(r)) mode and sent me on my way after I showed them data from my HR monitor.Since then, I've not had the 120bpm problem, but feel that the PM could be optimised to my circumstances - e.g. dual lead unit, very active, young(ish), technically minded. I still get a very irregular beat. I also now get out of breath a lot easier.First Q - why might DDD result in constant pacing of 120bpm (could it be a safety setting).Second Q - how can I tell if I'm being paced (during exercise for example) - is this data only available on download?Third Q - what kind of settings will help me with getting back to some moderate training?"
Heart Attack,Father had a STEMI,"Hello everyone. So I am a recent nursing school graduate and have had my RN license for less then a month. Tonight my father tonight came to me at about 9PM complaining of chest pain and nausea & vomitting. He thought it was indigestion since he suffers from GERD and asked me to take his BP.I took one look at him and saw he was pale and his skin was cool and clamy and he was very anxious. I immediately brought him to the ED because I knew in my mind he was having an MI and they did an EKG and the second I saw his EKG with a firemens hat my fear of a STEMI came true.Lucky I caught it and got him to a hospital and he had a stent placed. He initially wanted to ""sleep it off"" because he was determined it was indigestion. So I'm just curious, what if he did go to sleep while suffering from a STEMI? Would he have passed away in his sleep tonight? Absolutely awful to think but I cant stop thinking about it since if I wasnt home, that's exactly what he wouldve done."
Heart Attack,Left to right shunt,"Ive been feeling breathless for several years now  I've been screened by the chest and respiratory docs and sent back to cardiology (where I started)During a bubble test I received the news that I have a ""significant left to right shunt""They're going to discuss me in an upcoming meeting but I've heard nothing since. I don't even know what this is or whether I should be worried?Symptoms have been breathlessness at rest, increased upon exercise, lethargy, numb hands and forearms sometimes in the morning, chest pains and brain fog."
Heart Attack,"Difficulty Breathing, Heart Problems and High D-Dimer","About a month ago, whilst sitting with my Parents, I noticed my heart felt fluttery. This had never happened before.My Mum, an Ex-Paediatric Nurse, took my pulse and noticed it was fast and had an irregular pattern at some points. I rested and we all kept an eye on my condition as there was no pain to go with it.After a brief Camping Holiday (no heavy activities),  I noticed that my breathing was being weird. It felt similar to my usual breathlessness and through-a-straw type breathing that I usually get from my Asthma, except this time, my inhalers didn't do a thing to help me.I visited my usual Nurse at the Asthma Clinic and she noted that the cause couldn't be the Asthma as my sats were normal (sp02 98-100). I then went to my GP the next day only to be given the task of making a 2-week Peak Flow diary to fully rule out Asthma as the cause.Shortly after finishing the diary, I had to go to A&E as my Heart Rate has shot up to 130bpm and I found it difficult to breath. (No pain anywhere).They did the ECG. Everything was fine as far as they could see (by this point, all of my symptoms had started to calm down, typical!) They took a blood test and for the most part it was normal except for a High D-Dimer reading. They sent me home for the weekend as they felt it was safe for me to do so as there was no pain.I came back the following Monday for an X-Ray and a VQ Scan and I was told that there was nothing there to worry about. I was then discharged.I am now left with more questions than answers and not sure what to do. I still have the symptoms but now the Heart problem seems to have evolved into a consistent bounding in my chest which is unsettling to say the least!What should I do? Has anyone else had these issues before?"
Heart Attack,Elevated Troponin for 3 years,"I AM A 67 year old male, fairly fit, none smoker and not over weight. i had a cardiac bi pass 3 years ago in September 2017 and since my troponin has been elevated. Post by pass i got some abdo pain hospital checked my blood and found Trop level up, 2.8 (old scale). Told me i had a none stemi (heart attack) and should take it easy. But each month from November through to july  abdo pain returned, each time Trop level was up. Two cardiac stents where put in December 2017 plus January 2018 but still Trop level was same. Evenually Gall bladder was removed in July 2018 and by November Trop was going down, by January 2019 Trop level was normal. Next blood test done December 2019 after some left arm pain, behold Trop level back up 65 (new scale). Another cardiac stent inserted but now over a month later Trop still elevated and nobody knows why .Has anybody had similar experience and can cast some light what may be going on Doctors think it is probably not cardiac related but do not know what is."
Heart Attack,Ablation with an ICD,"Hi all - Following on from a heart attack almost 2 years back followed by a number of VT episodes followed by cardiac arrests, I had an ICD inserted.  I am also on a number of meds including Amiodarone, Toprol-XL and Entresto (amongst others).I have had a number of VT episodes since the ICD was implanted but fortunately the device has quickly corrected my heart with no major shocks to date (touch wood).My EP has told me that my device paces me at almost 100%.  I am assuming that means the device is essentially running my heart.On top of this, my latest VT episode was January and following this, my EP has suggested an ablation.  He did say that it is a last resort as it would then totally have the ICD running my heart.  Can someone please explain what this means.Appreciate the forum.regardsSteven"
Heart Attack,LEFT BRANCH BUNDLE BLOCK,"Just diagnosed with left branch bundle block.  Anyone out there dealing with this issue?  Just looking for what to expect down the road etc.  Currently having chest discomfort during day/night, some minor pain but not bad."
Heart Attack,Tachycardia/ Heart Palpitations / IBS help,"Okay so trying to keep my life story short... Looking for any advice or someone who is going through something similar because I am having a ""I cant deal"" moment and need some support.I have had anxiety and IBS for years. I was managing the anxiety well with Yoga, meditation etc. The IBS I have never really gotten a grip on. I cant find any patterns in the food I eat, I have had a gastroscopy, tested for celiac, the FODMAP diet with a dietitian, naturopathic medicine, probitotics.. I have done it all, and nothing helps. I just live with constant gas, upset stomach, and loose stools, going through bad phases and good phases. I eat very well and exercise a lot.June 2017 I developed insomnia, again I tried everything to fix it (magnesium, healthy sleep habits, melatonin etc).. nothing worked and with that came some serious anxiety. This is when I started to notice my heart palpitations. It felt like I was really scared and nervous all the time. I can feel my heart beating in my chest. I have a fitbit and my heart at rest is 89-108 bpm. Regardless if my heart is fast or slow, whenever I am sitting still I can count the beats in my chest and throat, and it feels awful.After tests for thyroid came back negative, I gave in to my doctors strong suggestion and went on antidepressants (mirtazapine) in October 2017. Nothing changed physically, but my mood did, I was less upset about the whole situation and was sleeping better, but still very uncomfortable.Then I got sent to a cardiologist, I wore a holter monitor for 2 weeks and was told I have Tachycardia with skipped beats... the cardiologist gave me Bisoprolol. I have been on it for 1 week and have had no improvement, I see my heart rate is lower, but I feel the palps still so strongly. I'm also having a really bad week with IBS, I have been woken up every night with stomach pain."
Heart Attack,After an SVT Ablation- bradycardia,"Hello,does anyone know is side effects from an SVT ablation can include bradycardia? i had my ablation for SVT around a year ago and whilst i still get the odd funny rhythm everything has been fine until recently.I've noticed that my heart rate is dropping very low (34-37 BPM) on a regular basis. I'm not getting any symptoms such a dizziness with this so haven't worried to much but friends and family seem to be very concerned.I cant find anywhere that the ablation could be the cause but having one from extremely high rate arrhythmia to less than 40 BPM is concerning me slightly.I'm 31 and in good heath generally, whilst i do work out its nothing that would cause athlete level HR."
Heart Attack,Afib/Anxiety ,"Hi,Just discovered this forum and was hoping to get some advice/assurance. Trying to work out if I’m suffering from Afib, ectopic beats or something else. I have been struggling with what I thinks is chest flutters/palpitations for the past few months (no sweating, chest pain etc), and have become super anxious about it, worrying I have a defective heart. My resting heartbeat when relaxed is around 55-60 bpm, but can notice an increase and strong heartbeat when I wake most morning or sometimes if I go to the loo in middle of night. This can some feel a little erratic but does feel somewhat regular but never really rises above 110bpm. On a few occasions over the past few months I have been lying in bed and feel myself get super anxious so automatically go to to test my pulse, also instantaneously my heart rate goes up and starts beating sporadically. But once I deep breath and count in my head this can then go to normal rhythm/beats in about 20sec to a minute.  This was something I never really noticed when I wasn’t so anxious about things.Also when at work (office job which is not at all stressful) sometimes (not every day) around 11.00-12.00 I usually feel a little flutter in my chest followed by some strong heartbeats but pulse again doesn’t go over 90bpm. Always around the same time which seems odd (possible sugar level dropping)I went A&E just prior to Xmas when feeling super anxious and had a poor night’s sleep and had an ECG which showed an ectopic beat (PVC). This kind of made me feel a little less anxious for a while and not worrying about a heart defect. However, I couldn’t shake the worry, so I went to Dr. I had another ECG and blood test and ECG showed a normal heart beat and blood tests was all well in range and cholesterol ratio at 2.4. I mentioned to Dr I cycle 7 miles to work daily and am in the gym 5 days a week (cardio/light weight) raising heart rate to approx. 150 bpm and can recover extremely quickly. And feel my fitness has improved over past few months. I’m a on plant-based diet and a recent over 40 MOT put my heart attack/stroke risk at 2.2%. Dr obviously sent me away reassuring me that I have nothing to worry about.For just over 1 week now I have been taking a large tablespoon of NowFoods Potassium Citrate powder in the morning with water and last week didn’t have any noticeable flutters during the days or during weekends. Did wake up though in the night with what felt like raised heartbeat and a little erratic, but this was the night prior to seeing Dr and also going for tests. Over past 2 mornings I have reduced the Potassium to 2 teaspoons and around the same time 11am-12 had a few noticeable flutters, so took a spoonful at work and these stopped for the rest of day. Also been taking a spoonful before bed and haven’t noticed any heart palpitations during the night.Apologies for the super long post, in a bit of limbo in terms of what to do, have I got anything to worry about from a heart perspective as I seem to be doing everything right from a lifestyle perspective (apart from anxiety) . HELP ;0)CheersSi"
Heart Attack,Post SVT ablation question,"Hi. I had my svt ablation 6 days ago. I am still getting episodes of fast heart rate, even just sitting at times. I still feel super tired and so confused. I was under the impression that it would completely go away. Can some people out there who have had this done give me some input please? Is this normal and for how long. How and when will I know the surgery was a success? When will I feel like working out and living a normal life again? Thanks so much Debbie"
Heart Attack,Visible pulse in neck normal?,"Hi,so I noticed 2 months ago that I can see pulse on both side of my neck, I think I didn't have this before. I was at my doctor, she consider this a stupid question but anyway she measured my pulse and blood pressure and everything was right. She told me not to worry. I am a skinny male, 30 years. Should I be worried about this? I can feel the pulse also, especially when laying on bed. If this would be symptom of some serious heart problem (clogged artery, heart valve) what other symptoms would I feel? Right now I don't have any other symptoms, yesterday I had some serious physical work and everything fine (no shortness of breath, no chest pain, no swelling)."
Heart Attack,No answers and I'm very frustrated,"This may take a minute but very important, so please be patient with me lolSo, my health concerns really started when I was about 13 years old. One day I was out at a friends house and trying on a pair of her jeans when my knee came out of place. At that time, my father did not take me to the hospital and I never got checked. In that same year, I started to get a very sharp pain in my abdomen that will only go away if I make myself gag (this is something I learned many years later). Not sure if its the sensation of bringing something up within my system that makes the pain subside for a few minutes until it gradually starts all over again. I go through this intense gradual pain for about 4-5 sessions until it finally goes away. When I was 18 years old, they told me I have gall bladder stones and removed my gall bladder. The pain never went away, I am now 35 years old and this just happened to me a couple of months ago. (its something that happens every so often, maybe once every 4 to 5 months.)At the age of 22, I had my 3rd child. One day while I was laying with her on the bed, I began to feel a strange arrhythmia/fluttering in my heart and pain all over my body. After several hours, I was very afraid and my husband took me to a clinic. At this clinic, they ran an ekg and rushed me to the hospital where I stayed for a couple of days and was told that I could have had a heart attack. Several tests were run and I was told I had osteoarthritis at the tender age of 22. (All over my body) I visited a few Cardiologists, had stress tests, etc etc and I was told the same thing over and over again....""Something seems to be wrong but you are too young to have heart problems...."". ""I'm also too young to have degenerative joint disease but, hey. For many years I've been on beta-blockers, anti-inflammatories, etc.Fast forward to last week when I visited an endocrinologist and she said ""Oh, you're too young to have a problem like that, it's just stress"". Let me just take one second to say that I am extremely over people telling me that. Because of my age, nobody seems to take me seriously. Anyways, a couple of months ago, I went to the Emergency room because the fluttering lasted too long and had me worried. The ER doctor came in and nonchalant advised me that I had hyperthyroidism and needed to see an endocrinologist. Saw endo, received diagnosis (hyperthyroidism and graves disease). Awesome. After this diagnosis, I was almost relieved that I finally had an answer to a question I had for so many years. 'What was wrong with me'. But I must have been extremely naive because for many years, my thyroid had been tested several times and nothing came up. Although I do believe that I have the thyroid problem, because of my blood tests, I do not believe that my heart problem is from that. I saw a dermatologist about 3 years ago because I began getting stains all over my abdomen, they looked like bruises that popped up all over. As soon as she came in, she said ""you look like you have lupus"". She took a skin graph and it came back with some strange skin disorder.I have tested for Lupus about 3 times and all three times it comes back inconclusive. I have given up on going to the doctors and being told the same things over and over again. I know something is not right. Here I am at work, with fluttering that has lasted about two weeks, all while I'm still on my thyroid meds. Two weeks ago, I also began having serious hives all over my body. Endo said that I was allergic to meds and just sent me a different pill.Well, here I am. I googled a forum to see if anybody has heard of the things  I've gone through. I'm sure I sound nuts but my mother passed away at the age of 58 years old, just after my graves disease diagnosis. Nobody listened to her and she shouldnt have died so young. I need answers. Help."

Heart Attack,23 with severe ED; severe heart palpitations in stomach. Vascular issue?,"Hi guys,I am new here. I am a 23 year old guy, about 6 ft. tall and 185lbs. For a while now I have been experiencing an extremely strong pulsation in my stomach (about half way between my bellybutton and rib cage, but right in the center). Sometimes it is associated with pain or discomfort. When it is beating the strongest and hardest is usually when I absolutely need to lay down and sleep. It continues to beat hard as I sleep whereas one would think it would keep me up.  I always feel my heart beat stronger in this location more than my chest. Sometimes I barely feel my heart beating in my chest at all. I went to my primary care who insisted that it is normal and that I am ""trim"" so it is okay. First of all, I am not trim so that makes no sense and it does not just happen when I lay down: sitting, standing, etc (you can even see it!). I forgot about it for a while but now I want to revisit this. I was diagnosed with a sleep disorder characterized by extreme daytime sleepiness and fatigue, and I wonder if a vascular problem could be something I am dealing with as a chronic problem. I was born 9 weeks prematurely, so maybe this is some sort of defect that went undetected.Symptoms:Dull ache in legs/knees (trouble sleeping)Dull pain in testiclesDull ache in lower back (could not sleep)Urinary retention and pain (urologists thinks interstitial cystitis)Cold hands/feetErectile dysfunction (no morning erections at all, not even able to get erection when medically induced for a penile ultrasound. Doc just prescribed viagra and cialis - both of which do not have any effect on me at all.)Extremely premature ejaculation (chronic)FatigueIncrease in fat around waist and breast area despite regular exerciseDecrease in muscle/bone in legs and arms (and butt)Weight gain in faceExtremely receding hairline (though this most likely is genetic, I knew it was coming one day, but still happening very quickly for my age).If I were to show you a side by side of me in 2016 to now in 2019, you would be shocked, and the crazy thing is, I am much more active now, though I get fatigued easily.  My legs look so skinny, I have no butt, and my love handles are growing like crazy even as I exercise and eat super healthy. My hair loss is terrible, and I am gaining much more weight in my face. My arms are also thinner even though I am working them out more. I have seen 3 Urologists (one of which was a complete dumbass), an endocrinologist who says my levels are fine (though my testosterone is low in the normal range), my primary care, and my gastroenterologist over the years. No luck at this point. I am completely unable to be sexually active at all, I fatigue so easily, my mind ad body are so tired and unfocused.Please, please please, can someone give me some advice. Should I see a cardiologist? I feel like it is the only department I haven't tried but I am tired of people telling me I am a normal healthy 23 year old because I sure as hell am not. Has anyone had these experiences? especially the heart beat in stomach and ED problems? Thank you so much!-T"
Heart Attack,Got too anxious and now my heart feels funny?,"Two hours ago I got really nervous for an exam result from school. I got an email from my Professor saying the results were ready. I started to get really anxious and my heart started to pound pretty fast in just a few seconds. My heart even skipped a beat which scared me.  Now I feel awfully funny. My left arm hurts and my head too. I'm getting pain in my left leg. I've had numerous EKGs and blood tests done in the past with no result of any heart issue. However, my heart is still skipping a beat randomly. When i tried lying down, it skipped a beat again, and I felt a rippling sensation below my chest. It feels like I'm having a mini heart attack. I feel like i can't breath well either and my jaw kind of hurts. I am 21 years old."
Heart Attack,Irregular heart beats,for several years I have had on and off irregular heartbeats but here lately it’s starting to become an every day thing if feels like my heart flutters and when it happens I feel like a adrenaline rush or something like that happens not sure   not sure what is going on I don’t have any chest pain with it or any other kind of problem just some strange heartbeats can someone please help me figure out what it is
Heart Attack,"I'm 16 yrs old, and i have left arm pain but no chest pain or tightening. What is it? Woorrieddd?","'Sup , I'm a 16 year old male about to turn 17 on Christmas Eve. For almost 2 days I've had left arm pain that doesn't bother me to much but I'm starting to get scared thinking i have a heart problem or even worse some type of lung disease. Chest pains are rare and not to painful just like pinches so i don't think that's a problem and my arm pain is like when you pull a muscle or you get injured but i don't recall getting injured or pulling a muscle cuz i don't do sports i mainly sit in my laptop playing games, but i have also cut some wood with an axe so maybe it could be because of that, and i only cough 3-4 times in 2 days. I'm mostly thinking that it's because of stress Because these last 3 weeks have been hell for me because my dad got diagnosed with brain tumor that passed on from his lungs to his brain and also my friend's dad died yesterday, and i have started smoking about 6 to 7 months ago but i don't smoke that much only 3-4 cigarettes a day maximum. What should i do? I don't think it's from anxiety cuz i don't know what anxiety feels like. And also I've been having breath shortness for about 4 days and I'm kind of getting a little bit to scared. So can anyone please tell me what this is. Is it a lung disease? Or some type of heart disease? Or none of the above?"
Heart Attack,stent and air travel,"hello, i have stent place in March of this year and started my work related travel from June onwards which is once a month.   With 5 travels so far, everytime body scanner detects something in my back or groin area and has to go through pat down. Prior to my stent I have never faced this problem and wondering if something going on. I asked my Doctor and he don't think any relation but I have read that sometimes body scanner can detect some condition as well, hence my question.  please let me know."
Heart Attack,Cardioligy...an INEXACT Science...??? (0 - 70% blockage?...really angry),"so...67 YOA...Two heart attack scares (huge pain in chest/shortness of breath) & a trip to the cardiologist.  Stress Test...Echocardiogram...blood work.  I go back last FRI for my follow up...doc sez, 'congratulations, you're heart is healthy...all your tests came back normal'.  I sez, 'thanx doc...so what exactly is my level of blockage?'  Doc sez, 'theoretically...zero to 70%, because anything less that 60 - 70% doesn't even show up on a stress test'.I am really angry at these hugely inconclusive results.  For months now I have been eating nothing but fruits, vegetables, whole grains & lean meats; & have literally lost 55 lbs.  I plan on sticking w/ this regimen...but what?...I now have to walk around for the rest of my life paranoid over having a major heart attack...???...which can occur at even 25% blockage...???...never knowing exactly how much blockage I actually have...???  I was so flaberghasted that I didn't even bother to ask him if there is a test that can measure exact blockage (although, I am assuming it would be something to do w/ running a video camera on a tube up into the heart, or some such invasive nonsense).anyone else experience this sort of thing?thanx,mark4man"
Heart Attack,Just found out I have pericardial effusion. Worried and scared ,"I've been having chest pains for a while and finally saw my cardiologist.  He sent me for a stress test which I aced. I also had an echocardiogram which showed fluid on the right side.  The doctor said not to worry and we will repeat the test in 3 months and we will decide if we need to proceed any further. He said on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the most severe, Im a 2.  Still I'm really afraid of what kind of treatment I will need or how invasive it will be.  The pain is still there on the right side. If you are familiar with this condition,I'd appreciate any advice or information.  How worried should I be? How is this treated? The thought of heart surgery terrifies me!Thank youFran"
Heart Attack,cholesterol and atherosclerosis,"So I had a PCI to put in a few stents. Doing great. But I'm on statins to lower my cholesterol (which was never really all that high). My question is about diet and cholesterol. Recent findings suggest that high cholesterol foods do NOT increase blood cholesterol. The bad stuff for blood cholesterol is saturated fats. So now we're told to avoid saturated fats AND foods that are high in cholesterol. Why the latter? Either dietary cholesterol makes a difference in blood cholesterol, or it doesn't. Truth, anyone?"
Heart Attack,CT Angiogram questions ,has anyone had a CT Angiogram and if so was it accurate? has anyone ever had a CT Angiogram that missed something?I'm not talking about a Angiogram with a cath. I'm talking about one where they use the dye and do a scan of your heart.
Heart Attack,Bisoprolol horrendous effects,"Hi, I'm not the patient myself, but am a worried daughter. My dad recently had a heart attack (approx 8 weeks ago). He was put on 2.5mg of Bisoprolol by the cardiologist. Other than being a bit more tired and achy he initially started off ok. The last couple of week, though,  he has had awful symptoms (all listed as side effects of Bisoprolol). His legs, ankles and feet gave swollen up, he is breathless when only mildly exerting himself, his joints are really stiff and painful, his usual very healthy appetite has diminished to next to nothing. His stomach has also bloated. Not sure if this is from bisoprolol-related weight gain,  or bloating for another reason. Every little task seems a big chore. its like he's suddenly deteriorated into an old man over the last few weeks. Last week he saw GP who agreed to let him halve the dose to 1.25. He said the breathlessness has marginally improved, but i guess its early days.  Could it be the Bisoprolol has now built up in his system, making the side effects more intense? Has anyone else had side effects like this? I hope there is light at the end of the tunnel, as at the moment he has little quality of life. I look forward to hearing from anyone who has gone through/is going through similar. Thanks in advance."
Heart Attack,Getting anxious and tired of worrying ,For the past 7 months I have been having problems with my heart. I'm 23 years olds with asthma and a type 1 diabetic. Im slightly overweight but not obese. My diabetes has always been very well under control. In high school and university I made mistakes and got into drinking and drugs. Almost OD'd twice on coke. This happened about 10 months ago. I then stupidly did more a couple months later and had a scary arrhythmia while driving. I was told it was probably my body telling me to stop and that is was being overworked. Since then I have quit. When I went into the hospital with the apparent overdose they did all the usual stuff and my results came back normal. Then after the arrhythmia I was told I might have something called WPW. However I went to the ER last week with sharp stabbing chest pains and they kept me monitored for 6 hours plus took my blood and did a chest x ray all normal again. I'm being told my hearts fine even with all the drug use and that I just need to stop which I have. I just cant shake the feeling that something's wrong. I am on prevacid for acid reflux which also occured after all of this. Could the pains just be from that? When I exercise I'm not out of breath and I also dont get any swelling in my ankles or legs. No history of heart disease in the family either. Here are the symptoms I get:Pain in fingers and toesSharp chest Pains left side near armpitWeird heart beat that feels like long and has trouble contractingIrregular pulse in both neck and armPain that spreads to backStrong stomach pulsationsSharp pains in the shoulders and armsBreathlessness when I have an episode usually after eatingFeels like my heart is vibratingErratic pulse that stops and then returns to normal and then repeatsI am seeing a cardiologist in 3 weeks but cant stop worrying about this. If anyone has any suggestions or can help that would be great.Thanks!
Heart Attack,Heart problems - do I need to get this checked?,"I'm a 24 year old obese woman for background. My family has no history of heart disease, my blood pressure about 4 months ago was fine and I'm not diabetic nor do I have any other conditions that could relate to this.I started 3 weeks ago with a jaw/tooth pain on my right side that came on suddenly (I say jaw pain as I can't pinpoint a location of pain with it), would last about 10-20 minutes and then dissapear again. it would happen randomly and was not brought on by any food, temperature e.t.c. I went to the dentist and she was a little confused because tapping all the teeth and messing around caused me absolutely no discomfort BUT I do have a chipped wisdom tooth on that side that I have had for years and will shortly be having taken out and that's what the dentist attributed it too.However it became apparent to me that I had other symptoms whenever this jaw pain would strike. I would have a deep deep ache and heaviness in my right arm, my right shoulder and my neck. In the last week these symptoms are more frequent and the shoulder is a recent addition. I have also this week started getting pain/discomfort in my upper back when the pain hits as well. I also have had pretty bad heartburn the last week when normally I don't suffer much. I'm very fatigued for no reason.I did go to the doctor in the early stages of this but he thought it was just a trapped nerve. but I'm just not sure. I've heard of heart issues causing similar symptoms in women (even if it is only on my right side) and I'm not sure if I'm just being paranoid?? anyone got any insight or similar pain?"
Heart Attack,How Accurate is a CCTA? ,how accurate is a CCTA in ruling out CAD?
Heart Attack,"New Job, New Illness!!!","Hi everyoneI wonder if anyone can direct me or even give me any information...I started a new job and within 5 weeks I had a heart attack, I then went into hospital and was told that my left artery was narrowed because of a blockage (blood clot). I was sent home after a few days with a Stent and lots of meds, 2 being blood thinners. I took 2 weeks off work as advised by cardiac team, then I returned on a phased return to work and had a return to work meeting were my line manager asked me to read the sickness/absence policy, feeling quite embarrassed that I had only started working for them a few weeks ago and I went on sick. I read the policy really quick. Then we agreed that I would only work 24hrs over 3days. Following this, I worked for 1 week and on speaking to HR and my manager I was told that although in the policies it states that I wold not be entitled to any pay, I could write a request letter to HR and request full pay because of the nature of the illness and more than likely they don't decline.I wrote the letter and called HR letting them know I was back at work, they then told me not to be worried because my job is safe and my pay will be fine because more than likely I would get paid full pay.After my first week back, during the weekend I had a Menorrhagia which caused me to go into A&E in an ambulance, turned out that this could be due to taking Blood Thinners for my heart. Anyway, I had a blood transfusion and on more meds to control the bleeding until further investigation.I then spoke to my HR and manager and told them this had happened and again i was told don't worry it will be fine. I wold get paid for the hours I've worked and the rest could either be classed as holidays or SSP. Now, leaving the hospital I have received a letter from HR stating that the only thing I would get is SSP (£98 or so).I am now extremely worried, confused, stressed because obviously I wont be able to afford anything. I don't know whether I can get anything along with SSP.Please can anyone advice me on what I should do or can doThanks"

Heart Attack,"Chest pains, no heart problem","My wife, for the past few weeks is experiencing severe chest pains that come on all of a sudden for no apparent reason.  I took her to the ER yesterday because of the intensity of the one she yesterday. She was checked for all manners of heart problems and all test came back negative. Her blood work showed that her potassium levels were low. The Dr said that this was the cause of her issue. They gave her potassium intravenously and discharged her. She had no episodes last night but has had 6 today.  Has anyone experienced this or know anyone that has, if so what was done?"

Heart Attack,My heart is playing tricks,"For a while now my heart feels like it beats as normal then struggles to get to the next beat, it is as if it needs a quick start to get to the next beat. It can last from secs or it can be off and on up to 30 minutes. It doesn't happen every day either. I don not have any pain when this happens. The only thing that i have noticed is that it seems to happen when i am sitting doing nothing. My GP organised an ECG which i got last week, that was ok, and i have to go in a couple of weeks to get the 24 hour monitor. Has anyone else experienced these symptoms? I am a relatively healthy 49 year old woman who loves my job and  my life so i can not even blame stress or panic attacks.aabb"

Heart Attack,Stress Test in the Bag...but concerned over no immediate info,"[will try to make this as brief as possible]67 years old...chest pain/shortness of breath...trip to the emergency room.  Results: No heart attack; & in fact...what was diagnosed as an ascending aortic aneurysm 2 years ago at 4.0 cm...was now 3.7 cm; & no longer defined as an aneurysm (possibly because in those two years I got serious about proper nutrition & lost 45+ lbs.).  But...all the CT scans/x-rays/EKGs/blood work in the world cannot determine blockage.[this happened twice in a period of one week, but the symptoms have all but gone away.  Although, when I eat...I get some minor shortness of breath]Next step...Myoview Stress Test...had that done today; & they let me leave (follow-up next week w/ echocardiogram).  After the final scan, I asked the technician what he thought the prognosis may be; & he said: 'Oh...I won't look at those images until this evening...between now & your follow up...no news is good news'.  Checking out at the front desk, I pressed further; & the office manager looked at me in a candid way & said: 'If there was an immediate issue...something that needed to be addressed right away...they wouldn't be letting you leave'.So...which is it...???...does the tech already know, but only wants my cardiologist to tell me?

Heart Attack,BNP test for hear failure ,"I'm wondering how accurate the bnp test for heart failure is? My test result came back normal, but 4-5 months before the test i was started on ramipril for blood pressure which i read is also used for heart failure. Could the ramipril lower my bnp to normal even if i were to have heart failure. I've been extremely short of breath, tired and have had some chest discomfort for quite a while. I'm due for an echocardiogram next month but until then my doctor decided to do the blood test to check for heart failure. I'm wondering if it was pointless now and if the ramipril would be making my numbers normal even if i have heart failure?"
Heart Attack,"I'm short of breath all the time,  and I'm afraid I won't get the oxygen I need","Hi Folks:I noticed I was getting out of breath about two months ago--early March.    If I take a shower and get dressed, I'm out of breath, and HAVE to lie down afterwards.  Simple things like getting up out of bed, or out of a chair, leave me panting, and trying to get air into my lungs.   My breathing is shallow, and I am wheezing while asleep,  my wife tells me.  No cough, just shallow breathing and the wheezing.I thought maybe I developed bronchitis, as I had suffered through a horrible cold in late  February.   I wasn't instantly out of breath, or breathing shallow.  It happened over a period of two months, and the breathing difficulty got really bad two weeks ago.My wife drove me to an Urgent Care on a Sunday morning.   The doctor listened to my lungs, and told me they sounded clear, and Dr. sent me for a chest X-RAY, which showed my lungs CLEAR.     The reading was low on the pulse oximeter  ( About 86 ), and the Urgent Care Doctor sent me home with a prescription to use two inhalers daily.I wasn't getting  any better, so I made an appointment to see my primary care doctor.   My doctor had me go to the lab to have blood drawn,  and I received a call from my doctor the  very next morning.   My doctor told me that the blood work he had ordered, showed that my blood was clotting somewhere, and  that information started a series of tests:-ultrasound of my legs-RESULT: NEGATIVE for blood clotsMy primary doctor thought that my breathing issues warranted an appointment with a cardiologist, and I am scheduled to meet with the cardiologist within 24 hours.The Cardiologist, after meeting my wife and I, asks me to schedule three tests :I am to have all three tests completed  by the 17th of June, as I have an appointment to meet with the Cardiologist again on June 21st.I had to purchase a pulse oximeter, to keep a log of the readings every day, up to the 21st.  I also had to purchase a blood pressure machine, and log those readings as well for the doctor.My pulse oximeter readings are low.  I'm usually 85-89.   I'm told that 95-98 is normal.My blood pressure readings are a little elevated for me  ( I'm averaging 140/80 )    For years, I was always 110/70.Here it is,  June 6th, and I have all three tests done,  but I have to wait until June 21st for my appointment with the Cardiologist, at which time she will lay out my test results, and tell me what my options for treatment are.Wow!   This is new territory for me.  I've been an avid runner most of my adult life, and have finished nine marathons, (the last marathon was ten years ago).  I've not had any cardio issues.   I have never had an appointment to see a cardiologist, and I'm 62 years old.My questions are:I'm on sick leave from work.  Most days for me are spent inside the house.  Taking out the trash is a big deal for me, as I can't catch my breath afterwards.I'm afraid--some days I think I should go to the nearest Hospital Emergency Room,  as I'm wheezing and panting and afraid I won't get enough oxygen into my lungs to keep me going.I sure would appreciate any cardio/shortness of breath issues you may have had,  which could help me at this difficult time.Sincerely,Donald"
Heart Attack,Abnormal Heartbeat pattern what should I do?,"this morning I woke up with a chest pain. I felt like my heart is racing so quickly grabbed the MI band and found out that my heart rate was around ~140bpm. I reconfirmed with manual pulse test. This whole thing lasted around 2 to 3 mins max. I didnt felt short of breath but in order to lower down my heart rate I chose to meditate with heavy deep breaths.after 2-3 mins, my heartbeat dropped down to ~40-50bpm and then got normal after 30 secs to ~60-70 bpm"

Heart Attack,Why does my heart hurt when I receive bad news?,"Hey everyone, I'm a 17 year old male (162lbs) who has absolutely no history of heart issues. I've even had an echocardiogram, EKG, and month long holter monitor test- all of which have come back as normal.Earlier I received some bad news and I felt a surge of adrenaline around my chest area along with some sharp pain. In total this lasted around 10 seconds before everything went back to normal. I have a feeling this could be related to anxiety but why exactly does my chest hurt because of it. Can adrenaline make a perfectly normal heart hurt?"
Heart Attack,Fast heart worries,"hi all i was hoping someone could help with their experiences of a fast heart rate.  i am 64 generally in good health,  have had all the tests done to check my heart and all normal,  but i cannot understand why i have such a fast heart rate.  it is always around the high nineties at rest as well,  i think the lowest i have seen it was at 74 when i was given a tablet to lower it for a ct angiogram.  i do get anxious a bit especially when my ectopics go crazy which of course takes my pulse past 100, anybody suggest anything? thanks"
Heart Attack,What is wrong with my heart? :(,"Hello everyone! I fell super dizzy, full of anxiety and I have a lot of headaches since few weeks ago. I checked my blood pressure. It was 105/55 on the left hand and 94/44 on the right one. The pulse was like 70-75. I recently did an EKG test and some blood tests and all was fine. I also did an thyroid ultrasound which was also perfect normal.  Do you have any idea about what is happening? Thank you for your time!"
Heart Attack,High C reactive protein (over 40),"Hi all,my Hs-CRP came back high in the mid 40s. I am very concerned if this has to do with CAD or is from some other kind of inflammation. I don't have any infections at this time that I know of.I have read in one or two places that metabolic and heart related CRP increases tend not to exceed 10  mg. I am hoping mine is from something other than atherosclerosis.Has anyone here have CRP elevations that turned out to have non cardiac causes?p.s. I have IST for which I am on Bisoprolol 2.5 mg. Nuclear stress test, multiple echos, ECGs have been normal so far. BP which spiked (diastolic) a month back is now back down to the 70s and mid 80s at most. my last A1C was in the non diabetic range.

Heart Attack,Some advice please,"Hi, hoping for some advice  what I shall I do.I have basically accepted death even thoe I have no diagnoses. I am 26 years of age and now finding it physically difficult to do basic tasks even in the house.I have a severe undetected condition with my heart and the doctors have now have put me down to overthinking my symptoms and not taking me serious enough because the first doctor had wrote that it has now  become  a chain. When i explain my symptoms they completely now disregard what i am saying like im crazy and dont know my body.I went to the ER had a ECG sent home. Went to GP ""overthinking"" your symptoms your fine. So II paid privately for a  ECHOCARDIOGRAM which took about 5 minutes was rushed report was normal. learning later a ECHO should not be that quick.I am declining severly and tbh i dont know how i am still standing.Blood pressure and hr all normal at this time, was a smoker for 10 years started pretty young. Quit 4 years ago as had hypertension. so changed my diet got healthy and reduced my blood pressure naturally.Its not stress its not anxiety its not in my head, and now i have no energy left to even bother to go to the doctors or a&e again because i just feel like i have to convince them to believe me which is sad.Symptoms started with general weakness about 2 months ago, then gradually got worse and worse. Symptoms nowchest painarms and head feel floppy almost like they are struggling to get blood, ive not had a stroke or anything i dont think. its more of a circulation problem as i can feel the blood actually struggling to go down the arms 24/7 and sometimes feel like the arms are dead and head droopy.dizziness loss of balancemy heart can be a regular a normal rate but a very strong beat almost like it struggling.breathless doing anythingwaking up gasping for air, think it is sleep apneaIm losing my balance and have passed out so now i just sit most of the time as my heart just cant copeMy thoughts are i could possibly have heart disease  as  i did neglect my body for a long period of time, smoking, obese, bad food etc.Doctors not taking me serious, dont want to go back to ER or GP as i just have not got the physical strength and also have to convince them something is wrong and get sent home after.  am truly wasting away, lost alot of weight also about my shoulders and down my arms.there is 100% a problem with the heart as i was active guy going out doing things non stop, now suddenly this.Truly believe  it could be heart disease and  severe narrowed arterie or something, lack of blood getting to my heart. I dont know what to do have given up and just accepted the fact i am going to die and have already written letters to beleive behind. that is how bad my symptoms are right now."
Heart Attack,"Dizzyness after walking, 16 year old girl?","Okay so I just had something strange happen. I was walking outside with my mom talking to her while she was walking for exercise, and was walking for a bit (probably about 10-15 minutes) without stopping while talking to her. And when I came back in and sat down, I noticed that the room looked like it was zooming out or something. This went on for a minute or two probably and then stopped.I've actually had some pretty out of nowhere dizzy spells in the past as well that weren't brought on by exercise or anything like that, but I dismissed them as an anxiety symptom because I've struggled with pretty severe health anxiety for quite some time, but this happened after exercise which is concerning me.I haven't been that active of a person, and I probably don't drink enough water (a lot of tea though). It also is a little bit hot here but I didn't feel like I was overheating when I was walking, and we just had some rain so it wasn't quite as bad as it's been being.So, basically, my question is should I be worried? Is there something more serious going on or is it just something like dehydration or whatever?Thanks in advance for the help.-Sincerely, an anxious dork."

My doctor first thought it could be due to my inhaler but even when I didn't use it, I still have a fast heart beat. Also when I wake up in the morning, sometimes my heart feels like it's fluttering and it will go away after an hour.I have noticed when I have asthma attacks my heart beat goes up, do you think it could be asthma related? Or could it be a separate issue?"
Heart Attack,"Skipped beats and fatty stools, ?","Hello.Lately when I go to exercise and heart rate raises, i feel like a flapping in my chest sometimes.. no pain. kinda like a flapping goldfish..Just earlier I sprinted up the stairs and felt like this same 'flapping' in my chest, so I placed my hand upper left chest area and my heart kept stopping and beating twice.. almost to catch up.. this was giving me shortness of breath, as though the skipped beat(s) were stealing some of my breath.After these bouts of exercise or walking long distances, I am absolutely shattered.. which is not like me (im 130lbs, 5'6 and 28 yo).also I have had really really light coloured stools.. almost look the colour of cornflakes.. but lighter. very greasy looking. foul smell.The only 'pain' ive had is 2 week ago when it was like upper abdominal pain.. kinda realllllly badly trapped wind, it went away after 1 hour.sometime I get dizzy at night, tired and weak in the morning and Ive woke up a few times 3am kinda.. gasping for breath (maybe thats anxety or panic attack?)can anyone help me? has anyone had similar problems?(i did not know where else to put this, because as far as I was aware, the problems I was having were kidney related because my GP mentioned this to me due to raised creatinine levels hence my first post on this site,  but my creatinine, GFR, waste levels have all got better..)thank you!"
Heart Attack,Residual thymic  tissue,"I had a CT on my chest w/contrast. My GP said I needed to get an echocardiogram ( which I had at the ER already too and they said it was fine) none the less, he seemed mildly concerned with the following statement from my CT scan. Anyone have any input? ‘Mild hazy soft tissue density within the anterior mediastinum, favored to represent residual thymic tissue without a discrete mass appreciated. No axillary or supraclavicular adenopathy.’ "
Heart Attack,Ectopic heartbeat,"Around 2 years ago I went to the GP with 'odd' heartbeat. I was told it was ectopic heartbeat and nothing to worry about. Sure enough, a week later it stopped.Recently I had a terrible cold/flu virus that knocked me for six. My odd heartbeats started again, but this time they haven't gone away (6 weeks later). It feel like the heart beat revs up, pauses, and thumps out an almighty beat. I'm very aware of it, and sometime it even hurts. I can get them individually, and then nothing for an hour, but sometimes they come in clusters of 6 or 7 within the space of half a minute.Recent ECG was normal, but they did observe the ectopic beats and referred me to a specialist (still waiting). My BP was also a little up at 140/90. Could my BP be causing this? My doc seems very relaxed about it, but given that I'm 6'6"" and weigh 19 stone, I'm sh*tting myself to be honest.Does anyone else have similar experiences?"
Heart Attack,Scared of my heart giving out or dying suddenly.,"I was admitted to the hospital back in January for a double PE in my lungs and have been prescribed Eliquis and Effexor since then.  fast forward to today and im in full worry mode about my heart.  im overweight and fighting to eat healthier/exercise but i cant bring myself to do the latter because im afraid of dying on the spot, even though the hospital staff assured me there was no damage done to my heart.  any thoughts/advice?"
Heart Attack,"Jaw, chest and arm pain","I've been having jaw, shoulder, armpit and arm pain all on my left side for a few months now. I also have central chest pain sometimes, i have had the chest pain for at least 3 years now, had all heart tests for that, multiple ecg's, an echocardiogram, stress tests all came back normal. I've had  a couple ecg's since having the jaw/arm/shoulder/armpit pain too, all ok.  All pain lasts for a few seconds, the most being a couple of minutes. A coupe of weeks ago however i had left shoulder pain all day with  bursts of jaw pain throughout the day lasting a few seconds at a time.  I am a bit worried now as i know jaw pain and arm pain especially on the left side can be cardiac related. I usually get the jaw pain by itself or shoulder pain by itself etc., not with the chest pain, it's all separate.  I am quite anxious, i was diagnosed with a small hiatal hernia 3 years ago and mild gastritis. Could this be causing my symptoms? Another thing, i mainly get these pains at rest, and if i get say, shoulder pain  it doesn't go away if i change position, it is constant. I have had pain on exertion ie running on the treadmill but that was months ago and i haven't had it recently. Weird symptoms i know. Any insight would be greatly appreciated"
Heart Attack,Sudden rapid heart rate - worried,"Yesterday I was playing golf and swung and suddenly felt my heart beating extremely rapidly. My guess would be about 200 bpm.I got in the cart and headed into the clubhouse where it was cool and rested. After 10-15 minutes or so it returned back down suddenly.  both the increase and decrease were sudden.I am a 26 year old male, 165 pounds, with a slight arrhythmia which causes occasional PVC’s. My blood pressure is also slightly high when not medicated, though I take medicine which controls it.This was in Texas where it is very hot. Heat usually doesn’t bother me but I am curious if this is a potential heart condition or a result of having a few drinks and being in the 100 degree heat."
Heart Attack,Diagnosed w/heart failure 2 years ago-but had mini attack i think?,"I'm a 56 year old female and  was diagnosed with heart failure about two years ago. The cardiologist said the top left chamber I've my heart is stretched out. He prescribed five medications. Which I am on now.Two times in the last six months experienced sudden severe chest pain, Felt like throwing up and dizzy. It was after lifting something heavy. I stopped lifting heavy things but I'm worried that it will happen again regardless and under other circumstance. Is it inevitable that I will get more small attacks like this or possibly is inevitable that I will get a major heart attack?"
Heart Attack,constant heart palpitations (16 y/o female),"hello all. lately my heart palpitations have gotten more frequent and more noticiable and it is very, very scary and i don't know what to do. my next doctors appointment is august 13th and i'm praying that it get's better by then. my heart is not to slow or too fast and doesnt seem to speed up when the palpitations occur. they usually happen once or twice at a time but then a couple minutes later it will happen again. i do not get dizzy nor have any dangerous symptoms but it still leaves me with a general feeling of unease. i do have severe anxiety and i will feel fine and then a palpitation will occur and i will get all worked up so i am not sure if these are caused by anxiety or if they are PVC's. please help & i'd be glad to provide more information with my symptoms if you'd like more info. they are really interferring with my daily life so i beg for some reassurance. i'm 16 with no history of heart problems but i still am terrified"
Heart Attack,perindopril and eplerenone interactions,I was diagnosed with heart failure. I'm 56 years old and since I've been taking these drugs I've had incredible weight gain. Also my pharmacist told me that there is interactions between these two drugs. Does anyone
Heart Attack,Resting heart rate,"I'm 16 and my resting heart rate today has been between 100-140 bpm all day and im so out of breath, please help"
Heart Attack,Can't believe I may have had a cardiac episode,"I'm a 56 year old slim and very fit female. I work out for around 40 minutes every day. Until the 'attack' I had a week ago. I do suffer intermittently from SVT but it doesn't bother me as doesn't tend to happen with exercise. However, last week I was on a long haul flight and as the plane left the ground I had the most excruciating pain behind my breast bone like a burning ball and crushing. It lasted several minutes before gradually wearing off.  It was like nothing I'd ever felt before and I really thought that was it! I was nauseous and light headed for around 45 minutes afterwards. I had an empty seat next to me and so just put the arm rest up and lay down. The following day on my return home, I went to the GP who was most concernwd. ecg showed ST depression and suggested ischemia. Troponin test negative. I have been referred to the rapid access chest pain clinic. I can't really believe I could have anything wrong though. Any similar experiences? It just seems unreal."
Heart Attack,I’ve had head and chest problems for weeks,"for the last 5 weeks i have had a constant feeling of nausea in my head and pain that spreads around my head and face that doesnt fade or go away , i also have a feeling like there is a weight in my chest and constant pain and discomfort in the left side of my chest my hearing in my left ear has gone funny and my sight isnt as sharp the i am a 13 year old male i am currently taking movicol for impacted stool i have also ran out of breath quickly and have had memory problems i have a 99% oxygen level and normal blood pressure i also had a bpm of 118 at one point i weigh 10 stone and am 5'75 i have also has pain in my back neck and arms and feel sensitive when i touch anything i am really worried"
Heart Attack,Are we being enablers by dining out with our heart patient friend?,"My wife and I go out to dinner fairly often with our friend C. who has a heart condition and diabetes and is overweight (probably obese). We're always amazed at her food choices -- fried foods, onion rings, etc. We haven't addressed her diet with her -- she's 70 years old, well-educated, under a cardiologist's care and should know what she's doing. We think there must some denial going on, and maybe the food satisfies some emotional need.What should we do? We like her and the social contact is probably good for her (she's single and lives alone, with a cat). Honestly, it's good for us too! We don't want to get her nose out of joint by criticizing her food choices. At the same time we don't want to help her into an early grave. Has anyone else faced this? Any ideas?Thanks!"
Heart Attack,Felt intense exhaustion,"Hello everyoneIn the last 50 days I've had twice kind of the same 'feeling'/'condition' that I'm about to describe to you.First time was a day when I was getting back home from work, felt a light 'pressure-dizziness' on my head then it expanded to my body ( legs, hands ) as a very exhausting feeling like my body would fall down. The moment it started I was walking with my dog and in my other hand I was holding  a bag. That day I was also very tired, it was the first hot days of the summer that was starting and I hadn't eaten. That weakness and partly 'faint' feeling kinda took 5-6 seconds and I didn't stop or sit anywhere but kept walking and nothing happened again. After 40 days I had some 'exhaustion' feeling during basketball game, in the last minutes I started feeling a little tired and then ( possibly my mind also worsen it ) I felt my legs and hands didn't have any power like my body had to sit down immediately. Didn't feeling dizzy, numbness or anything else. I felt that for a few seconds and went to sit down immediately and it stopped. Moreover, the last period of months I've been feeling tired quite often because my daily program is always full from morning to night and I haven't been resting enough except from night sleep. Last thing to mention is that my age is 25 years old, slim to athletic body and never had any heart or other health conditions so far. What do you think could the cause? Dehydrated or accumulated fatigue? Missing some vitamins or something?Thank you very much for your help and time, appreciate it.Looking forward to your response!"
Heart Attack,H C M,"After years of High Blood Pressure which resulted me going on medication when I was about 30.  then several chest pain scares and tests. Then a mild heart attack.   My GP eventually booked me in for an MRI scan, which showed I have Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.    At the moment It is being controlled with medication.  has anyone on here had to have a implantable fibrillator fitted."
Heart Attack,Racing heart after stopping Propranolol ,"Hello all,About 9 months ago I was having a strong pulse sensation right above my sternum and i was prescribed 60mg of Propranolol (looking back i wish i never would have taken it / don't think i needed to take it as that was my only symptom) I just recently weaned off of this medication over the course of 12 days (as instructed by my dr.) and have been off of it for 17 days now. Ever since stopping, my heart rate has gone up to where it stays in the high 90's - over 100 for most of the day unless i am lying down. I contacted my cardiologist and they said that typically that would not occur for that long. My primary doctor said the same thing. However, I can't think of what else could be causing it and it just so happened to start after getting off of the Propranolol. I have been tracking my heart rate with my fitbit and my resting heart rate has gradually gone up since stopping. I also want to mention that i never had a problem with racing heart before starting the Propranolol in the first place.I have had all the heart tests done (EKG, stress test, echocardiogram, 2-week holter monitor) all of which came back normal. My cardiologist just prescribed me Diltiazem 30mg immediate release to take as needed. I really don't want to be on another medication, especially because i think the reason i am having these symptoms is from stopping the Propranolol. I am unsure what i should do. Should i wait it out and see if my heart rate goes back down to a normal rate on its own or should I take the Diltiazem. Does anyone have experience taking this medication? I am only considering taking it because I don't know what racing heart (almost constantly) can do to my heart and if it can cause any damage longterm. Also, if this is happening as a result of stopping the Propranolol, how long will it take for my heart rate to slow down and return back to normal? Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you"
Heart Attack,Anxious about my heart ,"Hi I’m new here but I’m completely freaking so I hope this is right place to ask !!First off have really bad health anxiety, mostly focussed around my risk of having a heart attack and dying. In 2011 I had a coronary calcium score of zero and in 2017 I had a 24 hour ECG and an echocardiogram BOTH of which were completely normal. I’ve seen my GP numerous times and had a couple of ecg’s this year again all of which were normal and my GP keeps telling me my heart is fine...What’s bugging me is I wear a 2nd generation  Apple Watch mostly to track my heart rate on 25th after being stood up for 6 hours my heart rate was constantly between 145bpm (highest) and 120 average ... after reading online though this apparently can be normal as I was stood and that causes higher pulse plus was anxious??On sleeping the other day with my watch on my sleeping pulse which is normally (according to the watch) around 60ish had dropped down too 43 bpm ???On Thursday more panic, I had a pain in my chest near bottom of my sternum that though only lasted a few seconds took my breath away, I remember hearing though that if you’re having a heart attack you wouldn’t be able to walk up and down stairs so I ran up and down my stairs 3 times and was fine; nonetheless I rang 111 and managed to get in and see a gp who took my blood pressure and my temperature (as I felt feverish) and also listened to my heart and lungs and said all was fine !!On the Friday it happened again just laid in bed not log. After having evening meal and had same pain, again it onlyLasted about 20 seconds but felt like a lifetime and again felt like I was about to have a massive heart attack ???So my question is if it was a heart attack on both occasions would I still be alive now; would I know about it if it was a heart attack ?! Is heart attack pain different to I’m describing and can all these symptoms really be related too anxiety ?!?!"

Heart Attack,Results were not given to my Father of his Echocardiogram. This is worrying me.,"I have a hereditary condition that can affect your heart so I have to have  5 yearly Echocardiograms by the NHS in England. I had one on Monday & as always I asked the technician how it looked. She said that she wasn't a doctor but everything was normal. This is my 4th Echo & each time the technician has given me a good idea of the results.My Father who is 61 & also has the same condition as me had his first Echo today. I told him to ask for his results which he did. Apparently the technician also had his supervisor with him so maybe the technician was training? Anyway, when asked for his results the technician said to my father that he would write the results up but not to worry. This has me worrying now as I am sure if everything was normal he would have said that to my Father?"

Heart Attack,Norml ekg confusion,I'm a bit confused by my dr actions.  My issues started about a year ago I started having chest pains at odd times and I talked to my family dr about it. He did a new ekg every 3 months at my normal visit. But they were all normal we discussed my anxiety and stress being a cause but they don't trigger the pains. We ruled out indigestion after several kinds of pills. Family dr then sent me to a cardiologist who promptly did another in office ekg which was also normal. He promptly put me in a 30 day monitor which so far is normal and have 14 days left but they called and scheduled a chemical stress test and some kind of ekg. I'm just confused as if everything is normal why order the new tests what are these gonna show that the other ten have not. I'm ready to just give up and go on to the next thing but idk how likely it is though. I'm just tired of the pain and tired of dead end anyone know the reason for more ekgs and stress test if all the others have been normal

Heart Attack,Chronic high BP went away,I haven't made any lifestyle changes.  I've been on Nadolol and Lisinopril for years.  I started feeling weak and faint recently. I  took my BP and it was 85/50.  After a few days of this my doctor said to taper off and stop the Lisinopril if necessary.  After stopping my BP still ranges 85/60 to 112/69.  My BP has never been so good.  I go to the doctor Tuesday. He might want to test why it's so much lower.  I hope nothing bad is causing it. I've never had heart problems.  Has anyone heard of high BP going away?

Heart Attack,Prolonged chest pain ,"Hello,I have been experiencing chest pain consistently for about 5 years. When i first experienced it i was suffering from anorexia and was drinking alcohol almost every night to excess. The pain is usually sharp and i get it several times a week. i have also experienced pain in my arm and jaw and have had tightness and trouble breathing.I am no longer under weight or abusing alcohol but i still experience pain. The first doctor i went to chalked it up to anxiety because my EKGs are normal and prescribed zoloft. This did not help. I moved and recently got a new doctor who sent me to a cardiologist. My EKGs were normal, and so was my holter monitor and echo. I was then again put on anxiety meds that have not relieved the pain.Alcohol and dehydration definitely trigger the pain, but i also experience it when i dont have any drinks and my fluids are good.any ideas?"

Heart Attack,Stents,Has anyone had their LCX stented  ive got to have this done and have read a good few horror stories  im really worried
Heart Attack,Chest heaviness - Stress test shows nothing,"Hi All - first post here. I'm confused and concerned. I'm 48,  145 lbs, 5'7 life long asthma, and this year has been a challenge.  I thought I was having asthma issues ( heavy chest not relieved by inhalers). Went to urgent care and they gave me a nebulizer for home use. I was getting some relief but the heavy chest and discomfort wouldn't go away.  Saw my PCP who then prescribed a steroid inhaler which seemed to work for a few days then the heaviness came back. I went back to urgent care where they did  EKG and sent me to ER.  I've had many palpitations over the years and the EKG is always normal so I thought it would be this time too but they said it was not.  So in the ER they drew blood and although it came back normal they kept me overnight which truly I was relieved about.  Lots of palpitations but no answers.  So they did a nuclear stress test the next morning.  The MRI was normal but I knew I would not be able to stay on the treadmill for long.  I was on for about 5 minutes and said I was going to need to stop.  They injected the second time and I stayed on treadmill for the next minute and then got off.  I laid on the gurney and felt better almost immediately.  The cardiologist said, ""It's not your heart.  It wouldn't feel better if it was your heart.""  I asked what it could be and he laughed and said, ""I'm a cardiologist! I don't know but my guess is a bronchospasm.""    Followed up with my PCP and she isn't comfortable with not having an answer and so now I do have a pulmonologist appt coming up but through all of this, my O2 level has been 99% and my lungs have been clear.  I am also following up with a cardiologist.  I am still having some pain and palpitations but not lying down.They don't feel it is A-fib and they said my risk factor for heart attack is very low so I feel grateful for that.A friend who is a nurse in ER at another hospital asked if they gave me nitroglycerin but they did not.I'm at a loss."
Heart Attack,Husband's recent heart attack,"My husband got admitted to hospital this week after attending A&E with horrendously high blood pressure plus other symptoms and they've diagnosed a heart attack.  His angiogram showed several blockages and they're are now discussing options.  Option 1 would be stents but they say there would need to be four or more, so second option is bypass.  He had an attack similar to this last year but the out of hours doctor at the hospital did nothing and just told him to take an extra BP med that evening so now we're of the opinion that the blockages were there back then but no tests or meds were given.Dont know which way to turn or what to expect.  Does anyone have any knowledge of either stents or bypass procedures, recovery time, etc.  His job is reasonably physical and quite stressful so it's likely he'll be off for some considerable time and he doesnt get sick pay, just statutory sick pay which wont even cover the mortgage.  I work but my wage alone wont support us although it would be too high to receive any other benefits I think.Never been in this situation before so just need some guidance from anyone who has experience of this kind of thing.Thank you."

Heart Attack,Palpitations 20 year old male,So ive been having palpitations for maybe a year or two now and theyre just really frustrating. its a feeling of a sort of thump in my chest which seems to become more frequent when im tired and a bit worn out.ive had multiple ECG's which came back with nothing (although Ive heard that you need to actually have a palpitation during the ECG for it to be an effective test).  Do you think it could be anything serious? just not sure what to do about it. no one else i know seems to get them.

Heart Attack,61 yrs old with valvular heart disease - heart getting weaker,"Hi,My dad is  61 yrs old and has had valvular heart disease for a very long time. He had a check up today and the doctor found that his heart has weakened since the last time they met. They're going to do further testing on him but apparently an operation seems very likely.The thought of my dad having to go through this and just the word ""operation""  itself terrifies me and all I can do is cry, however I've decided to be more productive with my time and find ways that I can help him.Do you guys have any tips to 'strengthen' the heart. Any particular exercises or foods I can introduce to him?Any help would be much appreciated."
Heart Attack,Apple watch Heart Rate Reading issues,"Would like to share my experienceFor past couple of days I am going through dizziness , chest pain , flutter , palpitations kind of issues. Many doctors , tests are performed and everything came back as normal. They marked it as Anxiety disorders and asked me not to worry about it.Few weeks back I was checking my sleeping heart rate variations and I was surprised apple watch told me High Heart Rate for almost 1 hour during deep  sleep. It happened 4 times where I never realized something like that happened in sleep and was scared.Thankfully my cardiologist gave me Heart Event monitor for 1 month and yesterday was the night where apple watch said my heart rate readings were jumped from 64 to 109 and they were between 109 to 125 for almost 45 minutes. I was so surprised to see Event monitor readings during this period were still 60-65 range..Conclusion : Incorrect apple watch readings were one of the trigger point for my anxiety...."
Heart Attack,False ecg reading due to stress?,I went in for a ecg due to dizzy spells and low blood pressure. Before my appointment i had a huge fight with my husband and i was screaming and yelling. My ecg showed my left ventricle was very strong and he called it lvh. Could this be fa lse due to me having so much stress a few hours before???
Heart Attack,Regarding the article on Night Sweating,"I have suffered for years with night sweating changing my t/shirt 3-5 times a night. No help from doctor just told they do not know the cause. In January 2018 when abroad I suffered a Heart attack followed by Cardiac Arrest. I had two Heart stents inserted and for 2 to 3 months the sweating had instantly diminished, until it gradually returned to the soaking wet nights and continues. I am 75 years old with type 2 Diabetes using Insulin. This problem started before the Diabetes  occured and the use of Insulin. Any suggestions would be extremely appreciated. E Jeffrey Hazell"

Heart Attack,I’ve been told I need Open Heart Surgery.,"Hi all,On January 30th I had a minor stroke and was admitted to hospital. During the routine tests they found that I had a heart murmur and I was sent for an Echocardiogram. This showed I had severe Stenosis of my Aortic Valve. Further tests also showed problems with the arteries leading to my heart. I was then told I needed open heart surgery, which came as quite a shock.I am a 78 year old male, living in the NE of England and I would like to hear from anybody who has gone through this experience as I feel quite depressed and shocked at how quickly this whole matter has evolved.I am due an Angicardiogram in the next couple of weeks to check my arteries and then it is up to the Cardiologists to decide when I get my operation. Any correspondence with people who have shared this experience will be very welcome.Thanks"

Heart Attack,Underlying heart condition??,"I am a 19 Year Old Male, who is 6'6"" and weigh 140LBS. Ever since I was about 9 years old or so, i have had to give up all strenuous activity. When i run, or play any kind of Sports i get an extremely painful crushing pain in my chest, i get a very metallic taste in my mouth (no blood) but an increase in saliva. My head starts hurting really bad, my vision goes black, i get very dizzy, and cannot stand on my own. Its extremely debilitating and lasts for a good half hour or so, and i feel off for the rest of the day. They have done countless ECG tests, an ultrasound, wore a holter monitor, and a test where they hook up an ECG machine, and get me to run on a treadmill to get those symptoms. The symptoms came, but the test was clear. Every test has been clear, but to this day, i still cannot do anything physical, because the symptoms always return."
Heart Attack,breathless as in left sided heart failure,I have leftsided heart failure which leaves me very breathless what can I do to help myself whilst waiting to see my cardiologist
Heart Attack,Symptoms of Serious Cardiovascular Issues - Tests are normal,"I feel like I'm on an episode of Dr. House because no doctors have been able to determine what is wrong with me. I have spent thousands of dollars and so many hours with multiple doctors over the last year and I am so frustrated because my symptoms are getting worse and I still have yet to get any kind of treatment because I haven't been diagnosed. We have got through all basic tests for cardiovascular issues and are about to move onto neurological, but something is telling me this is definitely cardiac related. So, here are a list of my symptoms as well as the tests I have had done and potential diseases/syndromes my doctors have considered.Symptoms:High resting heart rate of about 100bpm. This is while sitting/laying. When standing, it goes to about 120. Simple tasks like showering, walking up a flight of stairs, walking 20 feet, speaking for a period of time can raise it to anywhere from 120bpm to 175bpm. I keep a log of these changes and my associated symptoms (fainting, numbness, etc) that come with the tachycardia.Fainting/Blackouts upon standing and after a period of time on my feet. This happens about once a week. I could be standing for 10 minutes and all of a sudden collapse. I usually catch myself and recoup before falling to the ground.Numbness/Tingling in hands and feet Especially first thing in the morning or when raising arms above head. It feels like my hands are asleep and will last hours at a time.Pooling of blood in legs when standing After showering or standing for more than 10 minutes, blood will pool in my lower thighs around my knees and my feet. This will turn the areas bright red and swollen and only goes away once I have laid down.POTENTIALLY RELATED SYMPTOMS:Extreme Fatigue I could sleep 18 hours a day and still be tired. I sleep about 8 hr/night on average and have always been tired throughout the day, but this is getting much worse.Weight loss I have lost about 80 pounds since November 2017. I am a 22 year old female, currently 6' and 168 lbs. I have stopped eating as much and been prescribed Adderall, but I am now unable to gain weight when trying.TESTS PERFORMED:EKG - Normal (laying down)ECHO - NormalBlood Pressure - Normal (Average 115/80Will be performance Laying to Standing Test today to potentially diagnose POTS.Bloodwork - NormalPlease help me. I am open to any potential ideas about doctors/tests/conditions. I know something is wrong but I am so frustrated that these tests keep coming back normal. This is not how I want to feel living my life. I can't exercise, walk up stairs, go shopping, or do anything that require even a little effort without feeling faint/having horrible tachycardia. I just want to get a diagnoses so I can get treatment and go back to enjoying my life."
Heart Attack,High resting heart rate at 16 years old,"i am 16 years old and my resting heart rate is around 80 bpm which is considered normal, however, it only takes me walking up my stairs at home (13 steps) for it to increase to 105 bpm. i do exercise and its not like im in bad shape.  sometimes i do some dancing, by that i mean just jumping round and going absolutely crazy, it raises to 130 bpm but then i monitor it and it drops from 130 beats to 100 in around  15-25 seconds.when i was born, my heart rate was 86 beats per minute. it always has been a bit on the higher side of the scale and it does rapidly increase with exercise but it also rapidly decreases when i stop. my blood pressure seems to fluctuate sometimes too. i have had an ECG in the past and the nurse said everything looked good but it was a bit irregular, couldve been because i was quite nervous and i used to have minor problems with anxiety. it'd be nice to see what others would think about this, perhaps im just a hypochondriac . thank you!"
Heart Attack,Heart valve replacement,My Husband has recently been told he needs a heart valve replacement.  He has been told his operation should be before the end of June.  i would be grateful if anyone could give me an idea of recovery time and how long he will be in hospital   i am really worried about him.
Heart Attack,I'm only 16 and I've been having heart attack symptoms for a while,"it started as really bad anxiety, to the point where now im afraid to go to school and suddenly fall over from a heart issue or something, i have palpitations almost everyday  then that gets me to have panic attacks, i only sometimes feel chest pressure like something is squeezing around my heart or something and sometimes small chest pains, just yesterday when i was laying down for bed i felt a really bad pressure in my chest and it scared me badly i started having crazy palpitations afterwards, some are stronger than others, ans i just recently started feeling a lil sharp pain in my left shoulder and weird pressure in my arm, its always on my left side and that scares me , the school nurses say im fine and my parents say its just anxiety and try to help me find ways to calm down and sometimes it works but only temporarily , i cant keep going like this its scary!"
Heart Attack,My daughter is dying of CHF ,"13 years ago, my daughter was diagnosed with Congestive heart Failure (CHF) and her heart was working at 10%, she was only 22.  She would not be put on a transplant list because she did drugs and they wouldn't wast a new heart on her. Part of me understood but the mom part was furious; she deserved a chance to start over fresh. But they told her to quit drugs and take her medication. Meanwhile I searched the internet for ways to manage her CHF.8 years later, my daughter continuing her lifestyle, had problems with her heart and the Dr put in an implantable cardioventer defibulator (ICD), which would help her heart beat normally and provide shock if needed. They offer that when your in your 3rd stage.I thought that right there would scare her into quitting dope, smoking and to eat healthy. No, she left the hospital and didn't change a thing.That was 5 years ago, she had an episode 2 months ago, I thought it was the end, it so scary. She had all the symptoms of the final stages: coughing weeding, spitting up bloody phlem, she was huge with bloat, her heart wasnt pumping the blood fast enough so it was building up fluid around her heart, feet, belly and ankles.She was in pain, could breath, anxiety; all signs were there, I just knew this was It, I couldn't begin to tell you what I was going through.She wouldn't go to the hospital because she said she wanted to die at home. I did get her to her Dr and her heart was 7% working. For those of you that don't know what that means, it's not her heartbeat but the percentage of blood thats pumped from her heart to her body every heartbeat.  55-70% is normal, anything less means not enough oxygen rich blood going through the body.Her Dr says she wants to put my daughter on Enestro, it has been doing great things for a year now and even though each person is different and there's no guarentees,this pill should keep her ""heart beating and out of the hospital""!!  Wow, sounds too good to be true. With that pill and her other ones, taken faithly, stop smoking, no drugs, exercise, watch her sodium and liquid intake, she will add a couple years to her life. Her heart is already pumping 15-20% now. if only she saw the need to change her lifestyle...but no. Don't think I haven't begged and pleaded and tried to reason with her, cuz I have, Ive shed many tears. I cant for the life of me understand why her life doesnt mean more to her, I know she doesnt want to die. If not for herself, for her 12 year old."
Heart Attack,"Rapid heart rate, high blood pressure, chest tightness, hollow chest pain all after eating.","This started about a week ago.I noticed my heart was racing and I felt like I was going to faint if I didn't get up and move.This happened two more times before I went to urgent care.They did an EKG and it was normal, but my heart rate and blood pressure was still abnormally high.The doctor added a beta blocker to my list of medications to try and bring my heart rate and blood pressure down.She also suggested I get a sonogram of my heart since I haven't had one in about 10 years.(I went to a cardiologist when I was 17 and they diagnosed me with high blood pressure and a heart murmur. At that time they checked my heart with a sonogram (it was clear) and they checked to see if my kidneys were blocked to see if it was causing high blood pressure (that was clear)Right now I'm taking:10mg simvastatin20mg omeprazole2 carvedilol tablets a day (3.125 mg) new medication urgent care put me on1 mg Finasteride25 mg LosartanI thought about it and realized this is happened about thirty  minutes to an hour after I ate.I've got a follow up with my family doctor's nurse practitioner in a few days.I've also tried to eat just a liquid diet and have found I don't have those symptoms, but if I eat solid foods then it will trigger a fast heart rate, high blood pressure, tingly hands, chest tightness, and slight chest pain.side note - about two weeks before this started, I was on a Zpack for a terrible cough I had. I'm still coughing up green phlegm about twice a day. The Zpack didn't seem to help all that much. I don't have a fever though.Please help with any suggestions?"
Heart Attack,Chest pain over the heart,"I am suffering from left chest heaviness/discomfort for the last 10 months since February 2018 on a daily basis lasting almost all hours of the day. I am a male, 42 years old, smoking many years, not known health issues– only cystitis on the bladder removed through cystoscopy last year.This left chest discomfort is mostly below the left nipple and sometimes move to the left (on the armpit) or to the right (close to center of chest). This feeling/pain makes be miserable and prevent me from every dayactivities including work. When happens sometimes I feel like to faint and seek emergency advise as soon as possible. Not much stress at work. AT times I do not have that feeling heavy headaches are coming.When initially started (February 2018) I went to the emergency and made all related exams (ECG, blood testing, X ray) which came back fine. After for a period of three months I went another 4 times to the emergency doing the same with same results. In addition, I have been to various professions (cardiac, gastro, pulmonologist, neurologist, neurosurgeon, rheumatologist, physical therapy). All related tests including ECGs, echo, Trend mill, CT heart with dye (cardiac), CT thoracic, fluoroscopy, endoscopy,colonoscopy (gastro), various blood tests including prostate, thyroid etc., CT chest, various X rays at numerous directions, X ray neck, and physical examination by neurologist were found ok. In addition, I did physical therapy including TENS, magnetic fields, laser, and massage. However, although the results of all tests were okI was having the same chest discomfort on a daily basis which was a bit relieved only by placing hot plaster at chest. At early June 2018, the gastro doctor has prescribed amitriptyline (at 10mg daily before sleep which later on increased to 20mg).After some time (2 weeks) chest heaviness/discomfort was reduced in frequency to the half (instead of daily it was every two to three days). However, at mid-September I realize that amitriptyline was not adding any value and thus I stopped it. A week after the chest heaviness/discomfort came back moreintense every day lasting the whole day and did not go away with ibuprofen, paracetamol, etc. The only thing which a bit produce a relief was capsicum plasters placed either on the back or chest side (due to the heat the discomfort was felt taken off).I went the last three weeks again to the emergency and GP and prescribed with baclofen which I took for almost two weeks with no results at all. Then, last week, the gastro doctor advise to start again the amitriptyline (initially to 10mg).As a conclusion, after having all these exams and pills nothing has been improved and the chest heaviness/discomfort is still here all day every day. Doctors told me that is something muscular/neuro, however, when I asked them whether it is costochondritis, fibromyalgia, or rheumatic polymyalgia they told me that they do not believe. As such the matter was left open with diagnosis of atypical chest pain.Can you please help me???????"

Heart Attack,How long do I have to wait to see a Cardiologist,"6 weeks ago I was due to have my second knee replacement but the day before the hospital rang to say the operation was cancelled as the anaesthetist was not happy with my ECG, and I would have to be referred to a Cardiologist, since then I have heard nothing.......

Heart Attack,When is it time to go back to Cardiologist,My yearly checkup with Cardiologist is in September. I had an angiogram March 2018. Cardiologist found one artery at 70% but did not put a stint in it.The last month or so I have feeling dizzy and faint feeling. Can't say I ever feel like I'm going to pass out.At work I do a lot of walking. I never really get tired/fatigued even though I don't walk fast or very long at times usually a couple of minutes then I'm sitting still. But my hands turn red and every once in a while my upper arms tingling for a few seconds. After I rest my arms stop but my hands continue to be red and tingling a little.My cardiologist said I needed to go backs to my GP and have him look at me. My GP nurse said on phone that Dr said to make an appointment with a specialist for the dizziness.Frustrating setting in.Should I try to make an appointment with cardiologist?  or maybe find a new one?
Heart Attack,Heart feels weird especially when working out /male 23,"Hello so 4 weeks back i got a fever that lasted for about 1.5 week, I felt no weird symptoms or anything just a regular flu. After it was gone and i felt good i started to workout again. lt felt good the first 3-4 workouts but after i had finished a chest workout i got an extreme soreness, probably from not execising for long and might pushed myself too hard but anyway the soreness lasted for a few days and during that time i felt something weird around my chest. There wasnt really any pain or anythingjust a weird feeling sometimes that had never been there before. So i got checked out by a doctor, EKG, blood tests heart check,pulse etc... It turned out to be okay. He told me to not workout still for 2 weeks just incase.  But what can it be ? l feel super fine and got alot of energy but just this strange feeling(ps i was gaming . Its been like 5 days since i visited the doc and i actually feel maybe better now after i've rested i suppose.

Heart Attack,"Is this a heart problem, or an ""anxiety"" problem?","Hello, I've been struggling with health problems for up to a year now and I haven't been able to find any relief.I'm a 26 year old male that used to be quite active (bit of a gym nut lol) but since these symptoms started have been unable to support my usual activitiesMy symptoms are as follows:I've had some tests done since then including:The Echo showed that my ejection fraction was less than 45 percent which concerned my cardiologist. He also noted that I presented symptoms of ""angina"" and raynaud's, which lead him to believe that my heart was, indeed, suffering from cardiomyopathy. This quickly followed with the MUGA and nuclear MRI. Ultimately these tests showed nothing all that concerning and my ejection fraction was roughly 55-58 percent. I won't be getting a follow-up until April so I'm assuming that that's the end of his investigating. Everything is fine, I guess.This has lead my GP to believe that I've been suffering from some sort of generalized anxiety disorder. Another doctor suggested that I'm suffering from nutritional deficiency (I lost my colon to ulcerative colitis in my early twenties). I'm not entirely sure if I buy into any of this, but at this point I'm willing to do anything to fix this.If anyone here can give me some advice I'd be thankful. Does any of this raise redflags, or should I stop being a neurotic millennial and just take the anti-anxiety drugs?"
Heart Attack,Can anyone help with my symptoms please?,"Hi, I was wondering if anyone can help?. For the past five/six months, I have been feeling breathless and often wake up gasping for breath. I also suffer from dizziness when rising from lying down to sitting up or from sitting to standing. My bp is very low  (60/40) and my pulse is low too (between 40-50 at rest) and I am not fit at all, infact I can hardly walk or carry out daily chores without having to take breaks, and if I go along the road to the shop, my pulse races up to 160 beats per minute. My legs also feel sore and heavy when trying to climb stairs and sometimes I have had to crawl up on my hands and knees. My doctor has referred me for an ECG and echocardiogram. Has anyone had similar symptoms, eg feeling exhaused, breathless, very low bp and resting pulse? And, if so, what caused it? Oh and the doc also noticed that my fingers and toes are 'clubbing' and I have lost weight over the past few month, unintentionally. Thanks for reading."

Heart Attack,Irregular heartbeat anxiety,"So ive had anxiety for 7 or 8 years and I usually get in these phases when I get anxious about symptoms and afraid of disease etc. Ive been fine for awhile but recently found a lump in my foot and was freaking out and went to the doctor, well at the doctor I was also very anxious. I got my vitals, normal blood pressure and the nurse says she hears an irregular heartbeat. I say could it be anxiety? And she said no that wouldnt give me an irregular heartbeat. So now im freaking out more and she tells the doctor. The doctor comes in and tells me my breathing sounds fine heart sounds okay that she cant hear anything and then diagnoses my foot and lets me go. Should I be worried about an irregular heartbeat? The nurse seemed convinced and kept listening to me taking my pulse etc, the doctor didnt seem concerned. Could it have been because of anxiety? Should I go back?"

I cant find an answer to this anywhere as most people seem to  get a calcium score with a ct  angiogram.Now everytime I go to doc with symptoms he ignores them because of all the tests ive had,I have a hiatal hernia and IBS which im hoping may be the real case, but the symptoms are holding me back from excersing again which I used to love?I live in UK,"

I have been dealing with this heart issue where it just does this big thump out of rhythm that I completely feel when not paying attention to my heart. It literally stops me in my tracks and I get really scared that its going to stop beating and i'm going to die. From what I can feel it happens about 1 to 2 times per day and scares me every time. Today it was so big of a thump that it actually felt warm in that area of my chest. It's like my heart is beating normal and then a thud like its off then about time I check my pulse its back to normal. I don't get any symptoms such as dizziness, shortness of breath, fatigue, or anything. It's just the scary thump that gives me this sensation of panic. Anyone deal with this??? I tell my friends and family and no one knows what I am talking about. Its so frustrating."
Heart Attack,Transmyocardial Laser Revascularization,Husband is having this procedure done in a couple weeks. I am unable to find any discussions about pro/cons of having this done by actual patients. It sounds kind of like Star Wars to us. ????
Heart Attack,Calcium score 263 ,"Im beyond worriedim 50 yrs old and recently took myself to a &e because  i had really odd chest pain   anyway i ended up having a ct angiography which  presented a calcium score or 263   they couldnt see variaus bit because of ""heavy calcification""  the letter which came from hospital only suggested i needed to go back ""if i still had ongoing pain""  yet when i researched this it suggested i was on the 99th percentile  ??? can anyone clear this upALSO for a whole year ive had 24/7 left upper back pain , and ive managed to convince myself this is connected ??any thoughts?"

Heart Attack,"CatScan, Stomach Aorta, no follow up","Please excuses for being ling and any typos as I'm speaking into my  Cell phone. On December 21 I was taken to emergency for a bruised kidney and they conducted a cat scan which found calcification in the stomach aorta  Noted as changes in stomach aorta.  I followed up with the veterans administration And they only followed up with me last week. I doctor stated the CD of Carscan provided them from ER will not be read  By cardiology. No follow up fast nothing was ordered not even lab work. My doctor stated they will just put me on statins.  When I inquired about my previous lab work 3 weeks ago before this incident my lab work was perfect.  I asked why they would give me statins without at least reviewing the CD to see where we're at with this.  I was told again cardiology would not review the CD and because I am a 60 year old female they just wanna throw I was told again cardiology would not review the CD and because I am a 60 year old female they just wanna throw these medications At me. I reminded my doctor I cannot be on aspirin or Statins since I am a 7 year survivor of 2 major brain bleeds and Statins are in direct correlation with the potential of setting off another bleed. I am seeing a private Dr. to get referral ti a Cardiologist thru my spouse insurance for second. I can not believe Statins would be thrown at me with our even evaluating the CD.  And, since lab work is excellent since going fill plant based eating don't you think some research should be put into this or at least an actual appt with Cardio to follow thru???"
Heart Attack,palpitations. Heart flutters,"After Christmas drinks, during a bit of a hangover I experienced a heart fluttering that lasted for a minute and really scared me. Been having palpitations since and occasionally have strange heart sensations when trying to sleep. Like adrenaline rushes that keep me awake afterwardI visited the ER and they did an ECG and found nothing. Doctor didn't find anything strange.Last night I partook in drinks with friends.  I over indulged and today and I got the same flutters.I'm worried I have alcoholic cardiomyopathy.  Anybody experienced this?"
Heart Attack,Heart palpitation with dizziness/feint feeling. Should I be concerned?,"Hi all,About 6 months ago I started getting regular heart palpitations, like every hour, daily. A few months ago, my GP sent me for tests including bloodwork, ECG, 24 hour monitor, general examinations and nothing was found so said it was likely stress or induced by something else but either way nothing to worry about and I'm in good health. After experimenting with changes to lifestyle, I noticed that when I stopped drinking diet coke (I drank a can daily, sometimes two), my palpitations stopped completely. I had the odd one every week maybe but down to normal range.The last couple of weeks I have been drinking diet coke again every night with dinner (I know, I shouldnt) and have been feeling fine until last night I was driving home and I had one of those palpitations which last a few seconds which made me feel dizzy and I thought I was going to feint. It was that horrible feeling when your head goes warm and you're about to drop. Anyway, I didnt and after 5-10 seconds I was fine. Havent had one since either....Do you think I should be concerned? Previous tests not that long ago suggested I was fine but I think the whole feint/dizzy feeling just worried me slightly especially reading online when every site says its a concern if you feel faint or dizzy.I am due to see a doc next week anyway and I am not touching that poison again. I just wanted some thoughts from other people.Thanks"
Heart Attack,"Dull pain left side chest, what ""could"" it be? ","Ok so have being having pains around chest for about 3/4 months also more recently hip and rib pain aswell as top back pain.I have being on sertraline for almost 3 months now (was 50mg upped to 100mg New Years Eve) but have put on alot of weight since starting. Have being told it should balance it self out and also start a weight management class next Wednesday for 12 weeks.Since dosage has being upped I keep on getting more of the pains around my left/centre breast area which are like a dull pain. It isnt all the time sometimes whilst laying other times I can be moving but it is there. I used to be able to take 2mg diazepam/Valium and this would settle but now I am taking 4mg and still having this pain on and off. I am concerned but my doctor/s aren't and tell me its not heart attack as that is normally caused by exercise and doesn't last this long,  it's not enlarged heart as I have had chest xray and ecg also my age being 28 (29 this Sunday) they Would know by family history....... so what could this be, I have taken the medication for anxiety/depression and it is still occuring.Also worth noting I have just finished a course of amoxicillin which was for a sore throat that was suspected to be a viral infection but that seems to have got better but still sore. I have found myself since increasing the Sertraline and taking the amoxicillin to be more fatigued and have had days in bed over the past 5 days.I shall also be asking my Dr on Friday to test T3 and T4 (have already had TSH) aswell as D-dimer to rule out hyperthroyidism and a Pulminory embolism. I know some will be related to weight now as I am now weighing 255lbs - 260lbs (18.5-19 stone) with a height off 5 foot 11. But I see programs with people who are double this weight and not moaning about chest pains etc so I dont think it is all weight"
Heart Attack,Feeling off lately. It started about 3 months ago with a major “panic attack”(?),"im a 26 year old female.. not diagnosed with any major medical conditions in the past.  i had a major what i was told ""panic attack"" in september  2018. ive always been a nervous person so i didnt think it made sense that i had a panic attack because i would handle my everyday anxiety in different ways. to describe what happened to me that night, i woke up after an hour of sleep and jumped out of bed feeling like all the blood in my body rushed to my head. i felt my heart racing and i had an urgent feeling that i needed something out of my body. i was trembling and shaking, screamingvfor my family to call 911. i started to go diarreha and then started forcing myself to throw up. the ambulance arrived performed an EKG and they said nothing abnormal was showing. my BP was elevated but nothing that caused them concern. i had a party that weekend that i didnt want to miss so instead of going to the hospital i slept an hour and went to the party. the next night and the next 4 after that i kept waking up feeling like i couldnt breathe and i would jump in a cold shower to lower my heart rate which felt like it was at over 140 and pounding. i would tremble and scream feeling like i was going to die of a heart attack . each of those episodes lasted about 15-30 mins. i would wait for my heart rate to lower. these ""panic attacks"" occered about another 15 times the month of october and november in total. from nov 9th until now january 7th i have not experienced it to the point of where i needed to run in the shower and scream etc. BUT for the last few months i feel VERY off. dizzy and off balance.  lightheaded. tired alot . i feel like my heart slowed down but it pounds at times, especially at night. sometimes though, it will randomly start beating fast and it freaks me out.. i have increased floaters in my vision. i feel like im falling backwards at times. i have shortness of breath sometiems. ive had multiple EKGs done came out all normal (sinus arrythmia for increased beat of 107-113 at times, not recenrly though as ive noticed my beat is slower now) , bp checked and its low at times but  healthy , oxygen 97+, chest xray came back good, thyroid blood test came back good, thyroid sonogram good, hospital panel blood test good, heart sonogram good. those are all the tests ive had so far. i even went to the ENT and he said he thinks its vertigo but im still stuck thinking its my heart.  im wondering if anyone deals with this constant off balance feeling and just overall tiredness and if it is panic disorder or is it my heart or head?"
Heart Attack,"Habit of beating chest near the heart, area now feels off","So im a 14 year old boy, who recently developed a bad habit of beating my chest on or near the heart, sometimes pretty hard.  could this in any way be the cause of my heart feeling somewhat off since i took my bike out yesterday?"
Heart Attack,Paranoid about heart health,"hi,first of all i mean no offence to anyone who is affected by any heart issues for real because i know it can be frustrating when someone who doesnt actually have anything is scared of it. Basically, in April my mum died from heart complications (she had a hole in her heart and i think some blocked arteries) at 47, which isnt that old. I already had mild health anxiety but this just caused it to augment massively and become an issue. Her father died when she was 4 from heart issues and all his brothers and sisters died from similar issues involving the heart. I know its ridiculous to worry now at 16 years of age but i am so terrified of dying young and from heart difficulties or just even having heart difficulties. I should probably mention my mum smoked and had a problem with drinking which definitely didnt help her but I am just terrified. I get scared of exercise in case i have chest pains, everytime i get a mild chest pain i get terrified and that just makes it worse. I really cant live like this anymore and I was wondering if anyone could help. Thanks"
Heart Attack,Palpitations,"Hi, I get palpitations on a regular basis which ok, mostly I can put up with, but sometimes I also get the feeling that I am going to black out. It only lasts seconds so I need to monitor my heart and blood pressure as this problem doesn't show up on the random ECG check. I do decaff so that isn't a trigger and I'm not a big alcohol drinker.So I want perhaps a watch to wear 24/7 that I can down load onto my computer to track my heart rate and blood pressure and give to the doctor. Any recommendations?"
Heart Attack,57 years old and had major heart attack morning after Christmas ...,"I feel blessed to b here.  I heard  them tell me on the ambulance, Lori, ur  having a heart attack. I heard so much in the background and they were giving me nitro and the next thing I knew they were shocking my heart. I guess I went black until I felt the bump coming off the stretcher at the hospital. Apparently they had to shock my heart again at the hospital. Into ICU and then transferred finally to another floor.     I remember asking the EMT to please get me to the hospital it hurts so bad and that I didn’t want to go yet I had grandchildren. The next thing I immediately did was prayed.   I understand the blockage was in the right coronary artery. I’ve always had vascular problems and an aortic bypass but just never dreamed of going into heart problems. Anyone else that’s had heart attack to the right coronary artery?"
Heart Attack,Heart monitoring a device,"Hello.I and my mother suffering with heart issue that doctors could not find a reason and do not consult appropriate treatment for a year. Basic reason i assume is when we are taken to hospital, we take medicine on the way before ECG reading. Holter monitor usually taken few days after symptom happen. So already taken medicine and injection by emergency room. I have decided to by own event recorder or ECG holter monitor device in order to catch up real reason.Can anyone please advice what brand is good and chipper? how to buy it.  i am expecting to get 12 channel.thanksTumenbayar"
Heart Attack,Been like this since Wednesday morning. What is this and how do I fix it?,"I was doing fine Wednesday morning until I lifted a box to be put away.  I felt tension below my sternum then shortness of breath followed by right side chest tightness, rapid heart rate and a spike in stress/anxiety.  My chest is still sore to the touch and it's a bit difficult breathing, and my heart rate is still up but I haven't noticed that my condition is getting worse.  I suffer from stress and GAD regularly but would this be a case of a pulled muscle as opposed to a heart problem?  The box I was lifting wasn't that heavy."

Heart Attack,Understanding my diagnosis,"Hello!I am 23 y/o male who started having some heart problems recently.10 days ago I had severe sore throat and got antibiotics. At appointment with infectologist they found huge dose of troponine in the blood (more than 2000, ref value ??5).Because of that I was hospitalized. They suspected I got myocarditis. After few days tropinine level fell on 250, and CRP fell on 70 (It was 191). I was released.After few days I took new blood test and newest results are perfect. Everything is normal. CK is 62, LDG 148, CRP 3.7 and all the other results are normal. Echocardiogram is normal.My blood pressure is 100/70Still, with these results I don't understand symptoms I have.Often I feel pain in back, chest, plexus, or left arm. I also sometimes feel like I need more oxygen.What could it be, if the blood results, ultrasound and ekg are normal?Best"
Heart Attack,Sex as a trigger for AFIB attack.,"There are virtually no articles on AFIB and sexual activities and the very few I was able to find even encourage sex as an exercise good for heart and AFIB. However, I had my first AFIB attack in the middle of sexual encounter a few months ago. I have had a few SVT attacks which is fast but regular heart beat and unlike AFIB is not life threatening (one major and a few minor) but all SVT attacks also happened during sexual encounters.I had my first SVT attack when I was 7 years old. I had approximately one SVT attack per year in childhood usually triggered by running (playing soccer) and then it disappeared for many years until 2008 when I had a major SVT attack lasting hours and my heart was brought back to normal by injection. After that date I had a few minor SVT attacks lasting a few seconds but this fairly safe childhood SVT attacks developed into something much more serious (AFIB) a few months ago.When I had my attack I realized that this time it is something different. It was fast but IRREGULAR beatings. My upper part of heart was beating chaotic. I called emergency and they took me there and put me on blood thinners. It lasted 56 hours and it came back to normal by itself (I declined cardio-version).  Ever since this attack my heart is not normal anymore and I feel like having sudden extra beats or pounding or mermer especially when I am sleeping on my left hand side I did not have after SVT attacks.I had my ECG a month ago and my heart is structurally fine (atria and valves are fine) and I am not smoker or drinker and I am at normal weight (BMI of 23) but have blood pressure (under control by medication).  I had chest infection 48 hours before the attack and took medication (decongestant) and hoping that the OTC may have caused it which if so then it may be a one time AFIB attack (I don't mind SVT attacks but AFIB is terrible).My questions:Is sex related AFIB attack normal? Then why is it not reported?Do I have to avoid sexual encounters for the rest of my life?Will this arrhythmia go away soon or will stay with me forever?Thanks in advance."
Heart Attack,[30F] Dypsnea on exertion and hypoxia,"Fit and active 30 year old woman (generally runs 30km/week) with no significant medical history, normal BMI, taking contraceptive pill. Had palpitations about 10 years ago (ECG at the time was fine and they resolved with time). Office worker with significant exotic travel (in case that is relevant!). Family history of SCD (maternal grandfather and his brother died in their early 50s; maternal uncle had acute onset illness that resulted in mitral valve replacement; maternal cousin has heart murmur).  Symptoms include shortness of breath on exertion and chest pain, plus transient desaturation that lasts anywhere from 15 seconds to a couple of minutes (per pulse oximeter). Resolves with rest. Very occasional palpitations have resumed. In the most extreme episodes I have struggled for breath, nearly fainted (but remained conscious), broke out into a sweat, had to lie down (in the street…) and desaturated to 75%. Symptoms emerged about 6 weeks ago after a week or two of decreased performance (getting out of breath during runs).In the paragraphs below I have noted the results of my tests so far.1.       Blood work: “Pristine” according to my GP, with the exception of low Alkaline Phosphatase (39 U/L) and lowish B12 (191 pmol/L – I think unlikely to be diet related as my diet is good, non-vegetarian and I eat a lot!)2.       Resting ECG: Initially detected left ventricular hypertrophy; subsequent echo revealed this to be a false positive.3.       Echo: Don’t have results to hand, but apparently they looked good and disproved LVH.4.       Pulmonary function testing: Looked good (apparently I have big lungs!)5.       6 minute walk (brisk-ish): No desaturation (using oximeter strapped to my forehead), but my heart rate spiked to 216 BPM.6.       X-Ray: Looked good.7.       Chest CT scan: Looked good (no blood clots).8.       Stress echo: Reached 85% heart rate capacity whilst walking and took a while to recover my breath. Echo looked good, minor ST changes of 1-2mm of horizontal/down-sloping diffuse ST depression. Normal BP response.9.       Bubble test: No sign of hole in heart, although with Valsalva there were late bubbles seen in LV. Doctors initially put this down to my body working very efficiently (because I am a runner) or a small PFO, but are now wondering about fast transit through lungs and anomalous pulmonary drainage.10.   Holter monitor: 2 ventricular ectopics and 2 supraventricular ecoptics (all during a period when I was walking briskly). Isolated beats only (no couplets). Multiple episodes of ST depression in channels 1, 2 and 3 of -4mm to -5.6mm, all occurring during the same period I was walking briskly. All episodes corresponded to times I was experiencing symptoms. Conclusion no arrhythmia, but heart is under stress.My doctors are great and are working super hard on this “unusual case”. However, life as I know it seems to be on pause and I am at a loss. I would be very grateful for your thoughts on areas of investigation."
Heart Attack,Should I be worried this is heart-related?,"Hi there. I'm 20 years old, not in the best condition physically but not excessively overweight. I would like any further clarification that my concern isn't heart-related.Around the last week of November I had chest pains accompanied by muscle weakness in the arms and legs. My entire body would also break out in pins and needles every now and then. Had a complete blood test done along with an ECG.The results of the ECG shows that my heart is fine, and the blood test show that I had elevated triglycerides and high uric acid, so the doctor recommended some medicines to maintain and lower it. I took the uric acid for about two weeks and symptoms were gone. A few days after I stopped, though, the chest pains are back. I've been passing up gas by burping or belching and my stomach rumbles too.The doctor I consulted just yesterday morning looked at the results of November and said it's probably GERD, and the numbness is caused by the high uric acid or anxiety. I admit that I do get anxious worrying about my condition. Gave me a proton pump medicine and I've been burping since this morning.Thing is even when I'm sitting, I would feel pins and needles all over my body in various places. Sometimes in my right foot and the left side of my face, sometimes just on one hand, sometimes near my elbow. It's random and unpredictable, and some don't feel like prolonged pins and needles either, though they do feel uncomfortable. Some of my muscles randomly twitch, too. I would also get back pain and headaches at random points of the day.I had similar symptoms in January but it passed eventually. We consulted with 4 doctors then, three general practitioners, who all assured me my heart is fine, and one cardiologist, who told me I was okay too. This time we consulted with three GPs to try and find me peace of mind and they tell me my heart is fine, too.Is it possible that, as the last doctor (and most of the others too) said this month, this chest pain really is caused by GERD and the numbness by high uric levels/anxiety? It's just odd to be anxiety when all I'm doing is sitting reading a book or something similar. I'm afraid to do anything now in fear of passing out and dying of a heart attack or what.Results have ruled out diabetes and kidney disease too, as the doctor said.Any help would be great. Thanks."

Heart Attack,"28 Year old, shall I be concerned? ","About 12/13 weeks ago had shortness of breath, light headed and had a panic attack.... first ever one in almost 29 years.Had ECG, chest x-ray, bloods taken but all come back fine. Was told ""ANXIETY"" since then I have being put in Sertraline/Zoloft and take 2mg diazepam/valium when I feel I need it. Also had heart listened to numerous times, allsorts of blood tests, another ECG and everything had come back fine so being told repeatedly its not my hearheart but my head and is causing anxiety. Carry on the meds and hopefully will get better but im still experiencing lightheadeness and after being scared to go out for almost 3 months went out Thursday just gone but after 2 hours if walking around town with my partner got a weird  pain in my left chest and started thinking the worst and hoping I could make it home, light headed, sweating, short shallow breaths. So went Drs Friday and was told again ""ANXIETY"" and the twinge was probably muscular because I done next to nothing for 3 months so need to stop being lazy but he said it was good I made it out.  Have also got some ibuprofen gel to rub in chest/back to help.Since then I have put this on once daily and inbetween used deep freeze or deep heat but still light headed and tired. Drs swear blind it isn't heart  but im not so sure"
Heart Attack,Alternative to the bypass,HelloI am seeking advice on if there are any alternatives to a triple heart bypass.My father in law is 71 and had a heart attack last week. The angiogram has revealed that two arteries are nearly fully blocked and one is fully blocked so no stent advised and now waiting for the bypass.I have been researching the market to see if there is a more non invasive procedure and see that the USA keeps mentioning Chelation therapy with another procedure that I can’t remember what it was called.Please can anyone provide any advice on this area ?
Heart Attack,Heart Palpitations and Shortness of Breath ,"Let me start off by saying that I'm an otherwise healthy 24 year old female. I've been having heart palpitations since the beginning of September. My heart feels like it's skipping beats and I also get short of breath. It only lasts for maybe 30 seconds but it's a scary feeling, especially with how short of breath I get. Sometimes it will happen multiple times in a row and other times it only happens once. It's happened roughly 20-25 times since the beginning of September. It most often occurs when I'm just sitting/laying down watching TV or on my phone, nothing stressful happening and I don't drink pop/caffeinated drinks (haven't for years). I looked it up online and it says that most heart palpitations are harmless so I initially blew it off and wasn't too worried. But about a week and a half ago while at work I became very dizzy/light headed while having the heart palpitations on and off. On top of that, what really worried me today is that twice while at work I had heart palpitations but this time I felt it deep in my upper middle abdomen and it took my breath away worse than normal. I feel like I should go to the doctor but am afraid I will be essentially blown off because I'm young and otherwise healthy. Any thoughts on possible causes?"
Heart Attack,Lower Heart Rate,Hi everyone! I have a question so I quit smoking a week ago. Yayy me! I have noticed today that my resting heart rate is a bit lower than it normally  is.  I am 41 female. Good weight. Blood pressure is normally 120/70 something.  While smoking if I'm just relaxing on the couch my resting rate is usually between 70-75. Today I noticed when I checoked that while resting it's been in low 60's and when laying ..took a nap it was around 58 59. Is this normal. I have no dizziness or weakness. Actually feel pretty good today nice and calm. So if anyone could just ease my mind or give me some insight that would be great.
Heart Attack,Fluid Overload in the Lungs Issue,"Hi All,My dad is 79 years old and he always have fluid buildup in the lungs very often. The doctor mentioned that this problem is due to his weak heart which has Ejection Fraction of 27%. He frequents to the hospital very often due to this issue. Is there any medication or procedure that can help my dad not have fluid buildup in the his lungs very often? The doctor suggested Pleurodesis but I am not sure whether this will solve the problem. Your kind advise is appreciated, thanksRegards,Daniel Louis"
Heart Attack,Feels like heart skipped a beat,"since this morning, ive been having this feeling of my heart skipping a beat every few beats, it actually started yesterday but the symptoms wasnt as obvious and was only very occasionally. Today the symptom is more obvious and constant when laying down and sitting, but when im standing up and walking i cant really feel it. I can feel the skipped beat in my throat, when i feel my pulse, it also pauses the same moment i feel the skipped beat, no pain. My stomach also wasn’t feeling well these few days. Ive had this problem a few months before, that was when I didn’t get enough sleep and was very tired those few days, that time the symptom lasted a few days then just disappears. Few weeks after that I had an ECG done and also a 24 hour holter, both results came back normal. The past few weeks had been busy aswell so wasn’t getting enough sleep, not sure if this is heart related? I’ve literally did the ECG and holter like 2 months ago and all is clear."
Heart Attack,"Hiatus Hernia, Intolerance to protein, vasoconstriction, strong heart contractions.","I’ll keep this to the point:I Used to be in the RAF, and almost instantly after a 4-month tour to Qatar in 2009 I started to have health problems.Problem (1) Basically over time I start struggling to digest my food, mainly protein.  At first this manifests as muscular skeletal problems, followed by hair loss, saggy skin and eventually burning in the stomach, nausea and IBS.Now here’s the kicker:Problem (2) After a couple of years I figured out how to fix problem (1), for instance: assist my body’s ability to break down protein or supplement with protein: either by taking a protein shake, free form amino acids, enzyme tablets with HCL, or restrictive diets.But after a while I start to get vasoconstriction: this is presented as painfully strong heart contractions, blood shot eyes, headaches, shooting pains in arms and neck and ED; all symptoms you would expect from vasoconstriction.  The problem begins as transient and then all of a sudden it becomes chronic.  When it switches to the chronic state, it takes years to recover, or as long as it takes problem (1) to come back.  Since the 1st time I caused problem (2) to go chronic I now also get angina symptoms when problem (1) returns, I imagine due to the strain I put on my heart after it took 3 years for my heart to recover from the chronic state of problem (2).Oh and I don’t even risk Amino acids or a protein shake anymore, only sparingly do I take enzyme tablets when problem (1) gets bad.Summary: If I cure problem (1) I get problem (2), to cure problem (2) I need to get back to problem (1) – and problem (2) is far, far worse than problem (1).I’ve been diagnosed with a hiatus hernia, Barrett’s Oesophagus and I also had a parasite (Blastocystis hominis) which I killed off in 2014.Does anyone else have anything similar: if yes please feel free to ask me questions and I can go into more detail."
Heart Attack,Slow heart rate ,I have always had issues with palpitations... chest pain/pressure etc..I am.nam.now petrified that I have a slow heart rate especially at rest on a normal day resting it doesn't get much higher than 62.... But at night when I'm sitting or laying it can go as low as 52 it has made my sooooo anxious that I continue to keep checking it... I have had 24 hours ecg before but I was pregnant then so I had a high heart rate I have had countless ecgs and blood tests and nothing has ever cone up... although they would not catch the low heart rate on an ecg as it's never really resting.. I feel so exhausted all the time at night I actually watch it drop 55 54 53 I panic thinking it's not going to stop going down it's sooo scary.. I meant I'm defo not athlete... I go to a gym class twice a week but that's only recent.. I hate the fact that everywhere reads 60-100 Is normal bpm... clearly mine isn't that normal ?? anyone else have a slow heart rate

Heart Attack,I feel like im hitting a brick wall........ ,"Im 28, overweight (put 2 stone on this year due to drinking energy drinks and esting take away) and up until about 3 months ago hadn't seen a DR in about 6 years other than when my partner gave birth. My apologies for the length but please read.I was short of breath and had some weird pain in my chest so went ER/A&E, after having Blood Tests, Blood pressure, Chest Xray and an ECG done was told it was anxiety to see my GP.Saw my GP who gave me sertraline but I didn't feel comfortable taking them so went back a week or so later explained I didn't want an SSRI and had my Blood Pressure done again which was raised still.Was sent for a blood test for  Renal Profile (UE), Liver Profile (LFT), Bone Profile (BONE), Thyroid (TSH), FBC (F), HbA1c (A1C) Fasting Lipids (FL), LDL, HDL and all have come back fine (cholesterol ratio was 3.2)Again told its in my head and to take atenlol to lower the blood pressure but I didn't want to be on a beta blocker and agreed to start the sertraline after being reassured they were pretty safe and given some diazepam/valium.It has now being 11 days on sertraline 50mg and taking 1 diazepam 2mg daily but blood pressure still sitting on average about 130/90 but anywhere between about 115/65 - 165/95 whilst at home but today at the doctors it come back 144/111 which made the doctor decide to put me on amlodipine and told me that the only real side effect is swelling of ankles but I have read 100's of users tonight saying otherwise so will not be using these.Are there any relatively widely used drugs to lower blood pressure where the majority dont seem to moan about them and even call them ""poison""I have tonight bought Garlic capsules to take with cod liver oil and magnesium what I started a couple weeks ago myself.Please some help, advise or user experience would be great"
Heart Attack,Resting Heart Rate 130-160; Thoughts?,"Hello! I am a 22-year-old otherwise healthy female. About a year ago, I was getting some routine blood work and the physician noted my heart rate to be elevated to 135 at rest. I monitored it throughout the next year or so, and this seemed to be a common thing. At rest, I would frequently find my heart rate to be between 120-140. A couple of months ago, I was sick with a stomach flu. After 2 weeks of nausea and diarrhea, I went to an urgent care. They referred me to an emergency room, as my heart rate at that time was 155. It remained 155 in the ED, after fluids it improved but only to 125. The ED physician was very concerned and prompted me to see my primary care physician as soon as possible. I had some blood work done at the time, not too remarkable - elevated lactic acid, elevated platelets but everything else was within normal values. I saw my primary care physician  the following week, and he did an EKG and TSH - both normal, other than sinus tachycardia on the EKG. He told me not to worry. My parents remained concerned so I saw another primary care physician in September of this year. They gave me a 48-hour Holter monitor. I recently received the results, and they informed me that the only abnormality was the rate, often times reaching 160. For some extra reference, I am very active with a healthy diet. I am not anxious or stressed. I am asymptomatic for the most part, but I do experience some occasional light headedness and shortness of breath, but I am generally able to exercise without a problem. I'm not sure if it's relevant, but I also have increased fatigue and very frequent headaches. Should I seek further follow-up about this elevated heart rate? If so, what would you suggest? My primary care physician who ordered the Holter monitor also did not seem concerned and did not suggest any follow-up."

Heart Attack,I am feared of heart block,"From more than 6 months I am living with heart pain ,earlier I thought that it was from gastrointestinal disorder but now it becoming worse and sometimes it feels like passing out, what to do??"
Heart Attack,scared..,"would i know if my heart were failing? i got 3 EKGs, 2 echos, chest XRAY and blood work in february that came back normal but all of a sudden this thought popped into my head... is it likely healthy 15 year old could develop a failing heart in seven months???"
Heart Attack,Chest pains,"Sorry to post this in here but i'm dying for answers, its driving me crazy. Basically about 2 years ago I was diagnosed with anxiety after weeks of chest pains and dizziness, i had 2 ECG's one at A&E and one at my doctors which both came back normal and then i had a stress ECG, which also came back normal. The chest pains and dizziness have come and gone now and again since 2 years ago but for the past 2 months i've had a bad patch of it, every day basically cant seem to shake this one off and now it seems to get me when im excercising as well, like going for a jog or on the bikes are the gym. So i went back to the doctors again last week and had another ECG done which came back fine, then went on a health test where I had an ECG done and a stress ECG done, both came back fine again but during the stress ECG i didnt have any chest pain, so maybe the ECG wouldnt of caught anything if i didnt get my usual symptoms? I'm worried sick i've got something wrong with my heart, i want to start going to the gym again but i'm too worried about it. Do I go back to the doctors and ask for more tests or is an ECG & stress ECG sufficient enough to put my mind at rest? I've now had 4-5 ecg'S over the past 2 years and two stress ECG, but i just can't get over it."

Heart Attack,Am I going to have a heart attack??,"Hi so I’m a 17 year old female; I don’t really exercise but I do not have diabetes nor am I obese. I also eat a fairly healthy diet. For a few days now I was having chest tightness, breathlessness, a lump in my throat, pain on the left side of my back that radiated down to my left arm, heartburn, and an upset stomach. I don’t know if this is related, but I also have a swollen lymph node on the side of my neck. Anyways, I wasn’t thinking much of these symptoms until today, where all of these symptoms got really intense and It legit felt like i was going to die. I still feel them right now as I type this. Am I possibly going to have a heart attack? If not, could it be something else that’s also dangerous? I’ve never felt this way before and I don’t consider myself to be an anxious person. I know this isn’t a substitute for real medical attention but i really need some advice. Thank you"
Heart Attack,Needing Advice pretty scared,Hi everyone. New to this forum and looking for advice. Two years ago I was diagnosed with a nod superventrical tachycardia . It really scared the crap out of me. I am 41 female healthy other wise. I had 2 echos done one last year one this year it says all is fine. My question is what do you do to calm your symptoms down during an episode. My cardiologist has put me on beta blocker which I haven't started yet just got them. She said that she didnt believe that it was very necessary however I've been having heart palpitations around my cycle and I'm peri meno. So she said it could help with those. Was wondering if anyone was on them what kind of side effects you have and also about exercise . Do you still do cardio with Svt any info would be great ty

Heart Attack,help,"i am 15 and i was born with a congenital heart disorder called bicuspid aortic heart valve. ive been monitored 1-2 times a year since birth. i was diagnosed with panic disorder and anxiety a couple of months ago. i was admitted into the hospital in February of this year because i thought i was having a heart attack. i had three ekgs, 2 echos, chest xray, and blood work. however, that was months ago. three or four months ago, i had this burning pain in the middle of my chest that would come and go. it went away completely after three days. i have shortness of breath that comes and goes everyday, it goes away when i dont think about it. i also have lot of other weird symptoms. i did the worst a hypochondriac could do, and searched up my condition. it said i am more likely to have an aneurysm in my blood vessel or something. ive been worried for months about this. would it have killed me already if it were serious? i go next week for my yearly and im so stressed and worried and ive cried about it because im scared of what they'll find???"
Heart Attack,heart anxiety questions,"i know its unlikely that any of you are doctors, let alone cardiologists, but how likely is it that i could develop a serious heart problem in seven months?? i had three ekgs, two echos, chest xray, blood pressure and pulse taken, AND multiple bloodworks done, most of which were in february before these symptoms started, and all tests came back normal. ive seen two cardiologists in february. anyway, im 15 with a crappy diet, but ive never smoke or drank.. how likely is it to have developed a serious heart disease in a couple of months. ive been going to the cardio 1-2 times a year since birth and ive always been fine, and told i would be fine until possibly my sixties and might need surgery... i really need some reassurance. i go to the cardio next week for my yearly and im super scared."
Heart Attack,developed sudden Bradycardia when resting not an athlete or someone who exercise ,"HelloI will start off by saying Im 22 and not someone who does any exercise tbh. I was on 120mg of propranolol for about 2 years prior all together I was on it for about 3 and half with a gradually increased dose for pounding heart, fast heart rate and skipped beats.So my symptoms started about a month ago I'd taken my normal dose of 40mg propranol at 11pm I noticed my heart rate went to 48 bpm and I was feeling nauseous. My heart rate normally is at 65 whilst on the BB (literally the day before) without it is around 73 whilst resting. I thought nothing of it but noticed it kept dipping under 50 the following morning and whilst walking briskly it wouldn't go over 75 and I was getting lightheadness and breathless.So I decided to wean myself off my tablets which was a big thing for me as anytime before my heart would react strongly to just missing one dose. So I went to 80mg a day noticed it went slightly up to 55 then a day later is was back to under 50 so reduced again. Nearly every other day I was reducing as my heart would still go under 50 even on just two 10mg a day i was getting feelings of sickness but my heart rate would go now if walking so I wasn't getting breathless anymore.As of now I'm completely off the propranolol for 2 weeks now which I'm really happy about but my heart still drops to around 62 whilst sitting and around 56 whilst lying down i can always tell when it's beating so because I get a funny feeling in my stomach. I'm just wondering what could cause my resting heart to drop by 15 all of a sudden and make my tablets that id been taking for years suddenly too strong.If i get up and walk it will go to 120 the other day it went to 160 but I'm assuming it's because I came off my tablets so quick but I feel fine all in all its just my heart will still keep dropping into the 50s when before it would be 73 ive spoken to my doctor he says it's because I'm young and fit but I do not exercise and the drop in rate is very sudden"
Heart Attack,Should I go to the ER????,"Hi Everyone,I posted this discussion in the anxiety forum but I would really like some advice from this one. Please.Ive posted a few times in here, but last night I experienced something I had never experienced before. I was studying and got this pain throughout my chest and back. I had never gotten this before. I stood up to go try to walk it off and in the matter of 10 seconds it turned into the worst pain id felt in my chest and I came the closest ive ever come to passing out. I called the ambulance and they arrived within 20 minutes and did an EKG. They told me the EKG was normal and good but I wasnt feeling the symtpoms when they took the EKG.BACKGROUND:Ive been to a few cardiologists and an electrophysiologist and they seem to think I had anxiety, but I have never felt the way I felt last night before. It was a completely new symptom and I almost passed out. PLEASE any advice would help so much. Please someone give me guidance. Should I go to the hospital?"
Heart Attack,Cardiac Symptoms for 3 years and counting...,"Hello,I have been having cardiac symptoms for three years now and I just dont know what to do anymore. It all started one day back in 2015.

Im not overweight, I have no family history, I have no medical history of any conditions. For three years now I have been feeling pain in my left chest area. Pain often radiates down the arm, into fingers, up to the jaw. Shortness of breath occurs frequently. Palpitations occur frequently. Impending doom feeling occurs.However, the weird thing is that these symptoms occur spontaneously, meaning they cant be triggered. They dont occur upon exertion. Ill be minding my own business watching television or whatever and BAM, chest pain.In the first two years, I saw doctors and got tests. I had several blood tests, ekg's, stress tests, chest xrays, and an echocardiogram. All normal. I even had an appointment with the top cardiologist in St. Louis ( a large midland American city with the steel arch). Even he couldnt find a problem.I dont know what to do"

Heart Attack,Being Prescribed Metformin After Heart attack ,"My hubby had a heart attack in february, he was prescribed the usual medications including metformin as they said he was diabetic.  He had never had any symptoms to indicate this condition, when visiting him in the hospital a nurse said after a heart attack glucose levels can rise, it takes about three months to revert back to normal.Everytime he has been to an appointment I have mentioned what this nurse said and only one nurse agreed it is possible.Well,  they gave him metformin and instead of trying to get him off it, the cardiologist put the dose up even though his level was fine.Has anyone else been told they were diabetic after a heart attack."
Heart Attack,Feels like i will 100% STOP breathing with dizziness,"Hi all,For some background I am a 21 year old male. I have always had symptoms like skipped beats and shortness of breathe but recently it has gotten much worse. Randomly throughout the day it will feel like I am about to stop breathing and will pass out because I get so dizzy. It doesn't feel like air hunger, but literally feels like my breathing will completely stop. Now I always feel pressure in my chest and left arm. I have already been to the ER 4 times and have seen 3 cardiologists and an electrophysiologist. I have gotten EKGs, Ultrasounds, X-rays, Blood work, and even a 30-day monitor and they tell me they cant find anything. Can anxiety really make you feel like you will just stop breathing like this? I get so scared because it also seems like I start blacking out. "

It would keep repeating and stop when standing up. A few months later blood pressure was checked and that was not an issue (resting blood pressure was not checked).2018 February, corners of the eyes became black, some ''puffiness'' is still visible in between nose and eye corners.2018 March, one morning noticed that eyes were very very red, not only the red blood vessels were visible, but the eyeballs were red too. After taking eye drops the redness was gone for the rest of the day. This would keep on happening and eyes would hurt a little from time to time. At one point the vision was blurry in the mornings. With the eye drops it was possible to get rid of this, however, some of those red blood vessels are still visible in the eyes.2018 May, went to the doctor because vomited and had diarhead the day before. Was also very dizzy during the last few days. Also, I would feel tightness in my chest and pain in my veins. When sleeping I would feel the blood vessels pounding in my head. During a doctor visit we checked blood suggar and pressure - did not find anything, assumed that it was dehydration.When laying down I would notice that my blood pressure would drop and those symptoms would start. Also during the summer in a bathroom I would notice various hairs on the floor even though that never happened before.Sometimes when drinking liquids like water, orange juice, as soon as I would swallow it, I would feel a blood rush in my chest area.During the summer for about two months I had diarhea almost all the time. It did not matter what I ate, digestive enzymes would help a little, but would not resolve the issue. In September, I tried eating a raw garlic and it eliminated the diarhea. The diarhea was gone, but came back for some time when I had coffee and a cake. I tried taking garlic again, but it did not do much. However, after about a week it was back to normal.In the summer one day some strange and small red dots appeared on the chest. Those were not pimples and it looked like it was something blood-related. It dissapeared shortly, sometimes I would notice something like that on my hands and it would also dissapear soon.At the end of summer I did an electrolyte test - everything was normal.At that time blue veins all over my body became very visible, blue veins in the chest area and legs/close to the hips. Veins on my hands and feet would sometimes be raised/bigger.In september I was swimming in the sea and while being in water noticed that my hands became extremely white, even the finger tips. I could also clearly see blue blood vessels in my fingers.Shortly after that I tried running to increase my blood pressure. I could only run for 2-3 minutes and would feel something in my chest and could not continue.Starting this spring until now, I am sensitivite to certain sounds. For example my AC, I cannot listen to it or I would get a headache(the blood vessels in my head seam to be sensitive to that sound). I never had anything like this before.Durin this time iron, haemoglobin, folic acid,  and B12 levels were checked including a complete blood count - everything was fine.So does anyone have any idea what could be going on? "
Heart Attack,Two large Hiccups followed by MASSIVE heart attack?,"Recently, my grandpa passed away. His last moments were described as having two large hiccups, then falling to the ground, and having seizure like spasms on the floor. He was declared dead within 5 minutes. I was wondering how this happened, particularly possibly why the hiccups preceded this massive heart attack.He had two heart attacks about a decade ago (almost cardiac arrest) and has had high blood sugar, pressure, and cholesterol. However, after those first 2 attacks, he became quite healthy through exercise and diet. Please let me know what you think. Thanks."

Heart Attack,Cardiologist says don't worry,"Male 57 healthy never been on meds. In February I felt like crap, tired, flu like, headache and dizziness. I went to outpatient and my blood pressure was 159/106 but nothing else the Dr could find wrong. I made appt with GP 2 weeks later because I still felt like crap. Again he couldn't find anything wrong except BP. This time 150/100. He asked what happened? I've seen this Dr every year for the last15 and never had a BP over 130/80. Dr put me on BP meds. This stuff was terrible!! I took it for about 2 weeks. Couldn't handle it anymore and went back to Dr and ended up seeing his nurse practitioner. Still feeling like crap and dizzy she did an EKG. She said it had a little funny thing to it and got me into a cardiologist with n a week. First thing the cardiologist did was changed my med. The new Med works great. Then the cardiologist sent me for a 24 hr heart monitor and a stress test that of course my insurance denied a couple times but finally I got it. The cardiologist finally got the okay to do a angiogram. This happened the end of May and found one of my arteries 70% blocked. The cardiologist decided that he would treat me with meds instead of putting a stepped in it. I went on a daily cholesterol medicine and of course my BP Med. Saw cardiologist at end of June. Still feeling like crap he said that there is nothing wrong with my heart. Got in to a neroligest and MRI on head. She said it was negative and come back and see her in 3 months. 2 weeks ago I went to ER. BP was 133/113. EKG was normal and all blood work was normal. 3 hrs later I walked out with nothing. So today I'm still feeling like crap I've had a constant dull headache, my left eye waters, both forearms and hands tingles, lower chest, more like very very upper abdomen has on/off pain, very dizziness and of course I feel that something is definitely wrong.

Heart Attack,What caused my sister to suffer a heart attack,Hi everyone. I would like to first give thanks to everyone taking there time out to read this. My sister who is 17 years old has died today of a heart attack back in my home country. My home country is 3rd world so medical treatment was not an option. My cousin came to Britain at 1 years old to seek treatment as she was born with a lump in her heart. The doctors did a load of tests and said as long as the lump didn't grow she will be fine. Now suddenly today she has had a heart attack and unfortunately passed away. She experienced no symptoms prior to this and all these years had no health problems so this has come really unexpected. My question is why after so long has this condition caused her to suddenly die. If the lump was cancerous and was growing it would of killed her just a year after she was born so I dont think the lump was growing. Anyway I was just wondering does anyone have a reasonable conclusion at what caused the heart attack. No autopsy was preformed as the country is pretty 3rd world so we may never know what truly happened. Thanks again for everyone's timeHi everyone.

Heart Attack,Symptoms resulting from withdrawal of anticoagulant and durietic,"This is about an elderly person with a history of heart failure that has been treated with the two types of medication cited in the subject. I know what the risk of withdrawing them is, death. My question is a little more subtle: what would the symptoms subsequent to the withdrawal?"
Heart Attack,Heart problems?,"So... I’ve recently been having “heart trouble” where when I stand up, I black out; I have episodes of fast heart rate while doing nothing (130-160), lots of fatigue, dizziness, and lightheadedness; as well as general tachycardia when not laying down. Heat, dehydration, low blood sugar, and standing make it worse. I went to a cardiologist who gave me a ecg (which only showed palpitations) and a full exam and said I had perfectly healthy but gave me an event monitor for “good measure”. So far I have been dignosed with:-Gastroparesis-GERD-Tachycardia -Palpitations Any opinions and/or advice would be appreciated.Thanks"
Heart Attack,Chest pains borderline ecg help!!,"I’ve been having chest pains on and off for 4 years I’ve had holter monitor, echo, mutliable blood tests and ecg’s nothing had come up. I had 2 ecg this morning they both come up borderline with moderate intraventical conduction delay and low qrs voltage in percordial leads, the doctor said that the ecg was fine but didn’t explain what all that meant, I’ve googled it and it’s saying that it’s a blockage in the heart!!  "
Heart Attack,Prolonged QT? Or a false alarm,"Hello all....i need a little help with some ecg i did a week ago...Im a male,26 years old and an anxiety sufferer.I was obsessed abouth my heart for about 6 months and i did 3 ecg's... all of them showed the printout ""normal sinus rythm"" and nothing else.One ecg i did in middle of a panic attack...bpm 95, all the values normal except QTc.... QTc was 544.... it was just a panic attack like all the panics i had in my life. I dont have fainting episodes in the past, neither a family history of fainting or cardiac arrests. The T waves in this ecg were normal, not notched, not far from the S wave...not assymetric. 20 minutes after the panic attack ..i took another ecg ...showing normal sinus rythm...bpm 83, and QTc 438...The third ecg o did after 2 days showed normal sinus rythm, 72 bpm, QTc 417...Could the QTc 544 have been an error of the ecg machine? (It wasnt a modern fancy one), or i do have a prolonged qt...i repeat...i do not have a family history of fainting, prolonged qt, or cardiac arrests. Ive been very active in the paste, and never fainted. I just had some tachycardias in my life (around 120-130 bpm) for a short time, attributed this to panic.Must add: im skinny, im not anorexic but some days i skip meals...and eat bananas everyday, so i dont think potassium has anything to do here.Thanks"

Heart Attack,Horrible heartburn and left chest pain for 4 days ,"To start off, I'm a healthy 21 year old. But I have gad, panic disorder, gerd, and acid reflux. For about for days my chest had been hurting pretty badly. Sometimes I will get actual sharp or burning pains in my chest, but the heartburn has been constant. I feel pain in my stomach too. The kicker is, when I've gotten mad or worked up the last few days I've had a sharp pins and needles feeling in my left chest. Im also having random left arm pain and left back/side pain. But another thing that happens is that i feel a horrible pain building in my chest, that I can feel and hear fizzle out in my stomach seconds later. My chest muscles hurt if I move a certain way too. The last kind of pain I developed was last night and this morning. The center of my chest burns with a deep breath. That comes and goes though.   I've been to the ER twice this year for this sort of thing, one being earlier this month.  They've done blood tests, ekgs, x rays, ecgs, and nothing ever shows. Not sure what to do anymore. Some times I just want to give up. To start off, I'm a healthy 21 year old. But I have gad, panic disorder, gerd, and acid reflux. For about for days my chest had been hurting pretty badly.

Heart Attack,PACs,"So I just had a followup with my cardiologist. He said that there were a few PACs on my 24 hour holter monitor. He reassured me that they are not dangerous. We have done all the tests: blood test, holter, numerous EKGs, chest x-ray, MRI, echocardiogram.  And it all came back normal. No structural abnormalities, no irregular rhythms, heart is the right size and oxygenation is good. But I can't help but be bothered by these. I've had them for years without having a name for what it was. Some days I'll have 1 or 2. Some days I have more. Sometimes I'll have an hour where I have several but none the rest of the day. My question is will they ever stop. And is this completely benign or is it a sign of future issues?  He prescribed a medication (can't remember the name) and said I could take it as needed. Like if I was having a lot or on a bad day I could take it to settle them down. I just can't imagine living the rest of my life with these constantly around. I'm only 30. "
Heart Attack,New to group and worried ,"Hi,  I had a heart attack about 10 years ago for which a stent was put in my right coronary artery.  2years later they found I had a AAA,  they put a stent to resolve this as well.  Then about 3 years ago I went to my GP as I felt very tired all the time.  They did an ECG and thought I had AF,  they put me on rivoraxaban and made me an appointment to see a cardiologist. At the app doc put me on 24 hour holster monitor.  I went back to my next appointment and was told I had ectopic beats and not AF. Trouble is I was having roughly 25 per min. So he upped my bisoporal and stopped the rivoraxaban.  I had to go back to have a number of tests like echo cardiogram, sonar tests and one I can't remember the name of,  the one where you lie on a table with cameras and they insert a probe in your wrist and inject some dye into you. After the test I was in the recovery room and the cardiologist came and said I had 2 problems with my arteries, which were very serious,  but the arteries were to small to stent. I had 1 blocked and 1 partially blocked that needed bypass surgery but he wouldn't do it because I have COPD,  I also had AF,  so they put me back on rivoraxaban 20 mg daily.  I had to have a stress test to see if my heart would stand the op. I had the test they wouldn't tell me anything, I have to go back to the cardiologist on 5th Feb 2019. I also have mental health problems,  depression, social phobia, ocd, agrophobia, anxiety and panic attacks,  vitamin D deficiency. I had an appointment with my physc doc  and he said I need to get out of the house and go for a daily walk even if its only around the block. So next day I went for my first walk,  I managed about 20 yards and I had to stop as I was gasping for breath I rested for a while and carried on, I managed 5 yards and was gasping again.  I had no chest pain or angina etc. So I thought sod this and went back home having to stop halfway to get my breath back.  So now I don't know if it's my COPD causing this or my heart.

Heart Attack,Heart palpitations getting bad,"Hi,First some history, I have EDS,  ME, CRPS.The last few months I have been getting heart palpitations. At first just one now and then and then increasing to between 10-30 a day. They are a big pause like my heart has stopped which takes my breath away and then a big thump, it lasts a second or two. I had an ecg 6days ago but didn't catch any of them on it. The last 4 days I have been feeling awful. If I lie down and don't move or talk or anything they are only every half hour or so but if I am trying to do something they are every few minutes and cause a pain in my chest and make me feel breathless and dizzy.

It eventually went away but I’ve had a few more spells since. I am a 20 year old female and the only heart conditions in my family have been my grandpa who had a heart attack when he was 70 and survived and my brother who had Wolfe-Parkinson’s White syndrome but is now cured. How likely is it that I will have a heart attack? I had an EKG about a year ago that came out normal. Should I order more tests to put my mind at ease? Thank you "
Heart Attack,Narrow pulse pressure,"A little about my background : I'm a 30 year old female with type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. I've recently lost 50 pounds (still have 40 more to lose). I've came off my insulin and control my sugar with diet, exercise, and I take Jauvia.  I control my blood pressure with lisinopril, 5mg a day. It's usually always within normal range, on average around 110-115 over 65-70.I woke up this morning to take my blood pressure reading and was a little shocked. I had normal numbers, but the pulse pressure was extremely low. It was 98/78. I took it again a few minutes later and it was 102/79. I do need to point out that I started my menstrual cycle a few days ago. I have PCOS and menorrhagia. So my cycles are a little longer than normal and I bleed a lot. To the point I feel dizzy upon standing. And I'm definitely feeling those symptoms at this time. Is there any correlation and/or should I be concerned? My primary physician is out of town and I'd rather wait to see her if I can. Thanks. "
Heart Attack,Is the heart enzymes test accurate in detecting heart attacks? ,"My mom went to the ER last week because she’s been breaking out into sweats, she’s been getting pains in the side of her neck & the back of it. They did two EKG’s, & they both came back normal along with the blood work. She has been very stressed out lately, & she is still worried. She has an appointment set up with her heart doctor, but I was wondering if I could find some advice/input on here in the meantime. Thanks in advance! My mom went to the ER last week because she’s been breaking out into sweats, she’s been getting pains in the side of her neck & the back of it.

Heart Attack,Elevated heart rate and decreased SpO2,For the last week my heart rate has been in the 90's which has never happened. Also my SpO2 is 86 which is very abnormal. Usually my pulse is 60-75 and SpO2 is 99. I feel a little short of breath but not bad otherwise. I do have anxiety and major depression also. I don't want to waste money going in to the ER if this is something that can wait. I am overweight but not morbidly. Any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated very much.For the last week my heart rate has been in the 90's which has never happened. Also my SpO2 is 86 which is very abnormal.

Heart Attack,Slightly depressed st segment lateral,"Hello. I have to have ECGs every two years for a work medical. I’ve never had a problem until the last ECG 18 months ago. The machine said:  Slightly depressed ST segment lateral probably a normal ECGDo I need to be worried by this? (The doctor who interpreted  the graph says not, as it was hardly different from my last ECG), but I understand the implications of this reading, so do feel anxious about itCould this have been caused by anxiety, as I’m always really anxious during a medical, & can feel my heart ‘thumping in my chest’I’m female, 56 years of age, normal weight, never smoked, try to exercise, enjoy a social drink, have no pain at rest and on exertion and to my knowledge have no history of heart disease in my family"
Heart Attack,Our daugther wants to have a baby brother.,My wife has a serious heart illness which gives her difficulty in bearing a child. We were just so lucky to be blessed with a beautiful daughter. But what she has gone through was never easy. It was very risky and I witnessed how she fought hard to have a successful delivery. That’s why the doctor told us she must not bear a child again. Our daughter is four years old now and is asking for a baby brother. She saw a foreign neighbor of us with two kids and is wondering why she doesn’t have a sibling. Isn’t she adorable? I feel so bad that we cannot give her that. So my wife and I decided to adopt a child for our daughter’s sake. I want her to have someone to play with too. 
Heart Attack,Still having shortness of breath despite Normal ECGs and Echodiagram Stress Test,"How accurate is the ECG and Echo Stress test in diagnosing heart problems?I originally only had these problems breathing at night.I went to he hospital and they did these tests on me.They did it on the day though.Would that affect the accuracy in a way?I'm worried that this constant shortness of breath is caused by a heart problem."
Heart Attack,Chest pain -w hat testds to ask doctor for?,"I am going to see my doctor next week to ask about tests for chest pain. I also sometimes get out of breath after a bit of exercise.I am a 52 year old male. The pain is on the left side of the chest, mainly.I also get intemittent palitations. I am concerned as I have sleep apnoea and this greatly raises cardiovascular risk. I have had an EKG already this year - all good. regular Echocarduioigrams over the kast 20 years wiht he last about two years ago.What other tests could be done?I just feel the pain is a sign that the heart muscle is labouring.  "
Heart Attack,WPW + Ablation + Fast Heart Rate? ,"HelloSo I'm having an issue that I just don't understand. My cardiologist isn't really telling me anything until he gets more data from a heart monitor. Two weeks ago I had my WPW Ablation done. Upon coming home I noticed my heart rate went down to a normal human way which is 60-80 BPM. A week after the procedure I noticed my heart rate went up to 90-93. I thought it's nothing and probably part of the recovery of the ablation done. A week later, I noticed my heart rate went up to 187 and would stay in the mid 100s when standing up. WPW is gone, so to slow down the heart rate the cardiologist put me on a beta blocker (Metoprolol) which is helping. Now my heart is back to what it was after the procedure into the 60-80s and almost never goes into the 90s. BUTIf I don't take the metoprolol then my heart rate goes way back up again. Since the ablation, I have gone to the ER 14 times and have done numerous ECG / EKG and they have found nothing. It keeps saying normal sinus rhythm. I even bought an EKG machine to see if that would find something and even that isn't finding anything wrong. I asked my doctor about it, he thinks it could be A Fib, but none of the EKGs show it. I think it might be AVRT which I hear is common with WPW. Attached is a recent EKG I did. The first part of the EKG is the loading portion. Why am I having this? On top of that, I am getting sinus style headaches too. I have had a little bit of chest pain but it comes and goes and its not sharp, but more of a dull with a pain level of maybe 2. "

Heart Attack,I am suffering from a mystery illness. Please help me.,"I went to multiple doctors but they don't know what's wrong with me. I have multiple tests done all have shown normal results but I'm not sure if those tests were enough. So here's my symptom. I have been suffering from this for two months. I have a rapid heart rate with minimal exertion. Just by standing from seated or lying position my heart rate would jump from 80 to 130 real quick. Walking slowly would make my heart rate go to 130. Just going to the toilet races my heartbeat and makes me feel tired all of the time. I could not tolerate exercises or sports anymore. I tried a 10 seconds sprint and I stopped because my heart raced so fast that my chest and back was hurting. Prior to this 2 months I was able to play basketball. I went to the doctor and told them my problem. I had resting ECG, resting 2decho, chest xray, thyroid panel, CBC, and electrolyte panel. All went normal except for chest xray. They found a really small coinsized inflammation in my right upper lung field and the quickly dismissed it as the cause of my problem because it is so small that it does not cause any symptoms. I am currently on tb treatment even though i am asymptomatic. Still, my fast heart rate with minimal exertion was not addressed and it's making me depressed. All of my cardiac tests were at rest so I think my condition will not be detected because it happens when I move. What do you think is this mysterious illness? I am going to an electrophysiologist for holter monitoring in hopes to bring a light to my situation. I am 19 yrs old no history of cardiac problem and have a structurally normal heart. I think my heart's electrical wiring is at fault here. Tell me what's your opinion I went to multiple doctors but they don't know what's wrong with me.

Heart Attack,Chances of heart failure at 23?,"I have severe health anxiety. I was recently diagnosed with Crohn's disease which I thought for sure was colon cancer. Over the last week or so there have been nights where I have shortness of breath when lying down. According to doctor google the only thing that could indicate is heart failure. My cholesterol is really good. My bp is 126 over 71. I run three miles at least 3 miles a week, but I still can't shake the severe anxiety telling me it's heart failure. This all started the day before my colonoscopy, so I'm wondering if this is just some extreme stress response, but I'm just hoping to get some insight. So, in short my symptoms are, shortness of breath when I like day, shoulder pain, occasional chest and back pain, fatigue (which very well could just be the Crohn's), and an occasional need to cough when taking a deep breath or laughing. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.I have severe health anxiety. I was recently diagnosed with Crohn's disease which I thought for sure was colon cancer.

Heart Attack,Murmur heard in neck,I’ve never had any cardiac or heart issues but I was having a medical last week  for a driving assessment when the doctor told me I had a murmur when listening to my neck. Then checked my heart and said it was fine. Does this mean the murmur is not a concern? Should it be something I keep in mind for future
Heart Attack,Blurry vision and vomitting after riding bike up a hill ,"Hi, I'm 20 year old female and I don't exercise at all so I would say I'm unfit. Yesterday I was out riding a bike and within the first few minutes, I had to ride up a hill. The hill wasn't too steep but I could feel myself getting out of breath, legs burning and heart pounding faster. As I reached the top I continued on riding but started to get blurry vision and it got so bad I had to stop and get off my bike. I quickly sat down on the grass and tried to breathe in deep to normalize my vision again. My vision was not getting better after like two minutes and then I suddenly felt like I couldn't breathe. Every inhale and exhale felt like I was breathing through a straw and I think I felt something funny happen in my heart but I don't remember. The breathing felt like my throat was closing as if I was having an allergic reaction. This only lasted a few seconds and I then felt a bit nauseous and puked a few seconds later. My vision went back to normal after puking and I felt fine after that. I haven't biked in three months, but I have rode up hills three months prior and felt out of breath but didn't have any of these symtpoms. Before, I had a big meal and went biking a few minutes after that and had no drink with the meal. When I was younger I have experienced blurring of my vision after strenuous exercise usually from running and have almost always puked after getting blurry vision but never had any breathing problems. I thought I was having a heart attack or allergic reaction to something I ate. I have had heart palpitations before where it feels like my heart flutters and then I feel like I lose my breath for a few seconds. Could I have unknown heart problems or was I having a mini heart attack? Any advice or ideas of what happened would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance. Hi, I'm 20 year old female and I don't exercise at all so I would say I'm unfit.

Heart Attack,Amlodipine side effects,I have been taking Amlodipine since January. The first few months I noticed the constipation. Before this med I was regular. My abdomen feels fuller than usual.

Heart Attack,Feel like my heart stops when in bed,"For about a year now I have been having this issue. During the day I feel fine, but when I am in bed starting to fall asleep, I get a sudden horrible sensation that my heart has suddenly stopped. When it happens I then start breathing as if i've just held my head under water for 2 minutes, and my heart beat is racing extremely fast - this happens for about 10 seconds then I feel back to normal. I usually get this once or twice every night and it always happens just as I am starting to fall asleep. I've had my heard checked out and all tests came back normal.Has anyone else had this?"
Heart Attack,Heart tested normal but been told it is anxiety,"I am a 31yo male and do regular exercise weekly. 3 months ago I was driving home from work and suddenly I had a crushing chest pain on my upper left chest which then radiate to my back. I then get a sensation that builds up to my head and I felt like I was going to faint, nausea, lightheaded, trembling, palpitation. This lasted for approx 10minutes then it would come back for another 2-3 times but no more chest pain. I went to the e.r and had cardiac blood test, X-ray of the lungs, ecg and all came back normal. This really felt like a heart attack. I went to my gp and he did further investigation with stress echo and a 24hr Holter monitor and ultrasound of the heart which was also normal. For the last few months I have been getting a lot of adrenaline sensation and palpitations. I went to see a cardiologist and manage to do a ct coronorary angiogram which came out normal as well. Recently I have been having trouble swallowing and feel like I can’t breath, and still getting panic attacks, adrenaline and palpitations. Can you get radiating chest pain from panic attacks? It has been a long road as all these symptom just started randomly and I don’t feel normal anymore. Is this anxiety or heart related? The crushing chest pain that radiated to my back just didn’t feel right. Can anxiety do this?"
Heart Attack,Heart Surgery Or Stents? The Big Question,"Hi folks, I am delighted to be able to join this group and it is so helpful. I seek a few andswers some of you may know the answer to. Here goes...I suffered a heart attack(STEMI) 5 years ago whilst clearing snow and was taken to hosp and fitted with a stent. The pain releif was immediate and I had no problems after that for 5 years...then all of a sudden I felt dizzy and disorientated whilst standing up talking to my wife and my heart was pounding! Ambulance came, A&E showed raised Protonin levels and I was angiogrammed next day and a second sten in artery number 2.History repeated itself a year later and stent 3 was put in another vessel.Since the insertion of the 3rd stent I seemd to have developed frequent unstable angina out of the blue!My attacks are no daily and more common throughout the day. Again into angio for an angiogramme, nothing untoward noted. Diagnosed with unstable angina (what a surprise).Here's the question at last that I need answers to from you folks.I am 57, slim, non skoker for 8 years. I changed my whole diet but in fairness I could do more excercise BUT suffer from mild anxiety attacks I control menatlly... so no biggie.I am now scared of having another 'episode' requiring a stent which seems inevitable. It seems to be just a quaetion of time. I am now more breathless even after short walks and mild excercise... yet they say my stents are patent.Q: If I ask for and get a Bypass and triple bypass at that- will the unstable angine be history and set me back onto a steady life with job prospects- I currently lost my job but have not yet claimed benefits in UK.... since my wife works I would get very little.I look forward to hearing some thoughs here.

Heart Attack,Heart discomfort and pain in the left arm,"Hi People,I’m 25 years old and never had any major health complaints/issue since November last year. I don’t usually suffer from  Panic Attacks neither chronic anxiety issues.Main symptomsPain on left side of the chest (heart)Left arm painLeft arm weaknessBody weaknessStiff muscles (mainly on the left side of the neck)Shortness of BreathTinglingFatigueMemory lossLeft Eye pain (like a needle prick)Dry body - mainly on left side (hand, feet, throat)Diagnosis so farHigh CholesterolSmall Vitamin D deficiencyStorySince November last year, I've been having some weird symptoms. One day I came back from work and was sitting down watching TV with my wife, when suddenly I felt a small discomfort on the left side of my chest. This discomfort started to get stronger and stronger, and suddenly I got this pain in my left arm and left shoulder. My muscles got very hard, mainly on the left side of my neck and shoulder.Then I started to get worried, since I never had any symptom like this before. I even thought that could be my Ritalin, but since I started taking it (2 years ago), I never felt anything similar. This pain on the chest was getting sharper and sharper, and I got very lightheaded and weak. Then I remembered my dad saying to me one day that before  my Grandma died from Heart Attack, she felt this pain in the left arm. Then I decided to search on Google (as most of you), and, the results were all going to Heart Attack. Together with the light-headedness I also felt very panicked by that. For the first time I really thought I was about to die, so I asked my wife to call the ambulance. The ambulance arrived and they did all the Cardiogram stuff, checked my blood pressure, etc. and  they said everything was fine. They asked if I wanted them to bring me to the hospital, but I believed them and decided not to go and then came back home.After I came back home, while I was sitting down, the sharp pain in the heart and the lightheadedness came back. So we decided to get a taxi and go to the A&E. There the doctor did all the ECG stuff again, chest X-Ray and many blood tests. They didn’t find anything wrong, so I was sent back home.After that, I started to have this chest discomfort more often. I even stayed almost 2 months without taking Ritalin and everything that contains caffeine, but the discomfort was always coming back.So I went to my GP and she referred me to the Cardiologist that asked for a Heart Ultrasound and that Treadmill exam. The Cardio said there’s nothing wrong with my heart, but the symptoms didn’t go away either.Since this chest pain is always succeeded by a muscle stiffness, I also asked my GP to refer me to a Neck ultrasound, where they also didn’t find anything.I was getting very hopeless, because I was sure of my pain and where I was thinking   the problem was (heart), the doctors couldn’t find anything, so then I started to search on Google all my symptoms.Okay, this part is probably the worst of all.After all these researches, I discovered that I am a bit hypochondriac, I had many symptoms that matched with Multiple Sclerosis and Brain tumour, and I convinced myself I had one of these. Ok, I know most of you (like the doctors) will think all of it is due to anxiety, panic attack or stress, but believe in me, it is not. I’m not stressed, I’m not anxious, I never had panic attacks and I know anxiety can come all of a sudden without any apparent reason, but I seriously doubt this is anxiety.So I got a referral to the Neurologist where he asked for a MRI Scan off the head.I went to the Neurologist, and the same results. You have no brain damage, no MS and no Brain tumour.After few days, these “episodes” weren’t happening often like before, but I could see my memory getting worse every day, my left arm was getting weaker every single day, the need of drinking water was much stronger than before, etc.Today when I was talking to my colleagues at work, I felt that very weird light-headedness,  followed by the sharp pain in my heart and in the entire left arm. I thought I’d pass out. So I decided to go to the clinic, he did the ECG and everything was fine.I’m feeling completely hopeless. The doctors can’t find what’s wrong with me and looks like I can feel this pain in my heart and in the left arm getting worse every single day. I cannot drink 2 cups of coffee or 2 cups of coke per day anymore without feel my heart and my entire body weird.I would appreciate if anybody could help me, or at least suggest the next steps I should take.Thanks in advance."

Heart Attack,Pain over heart? EKG normal. ,"Hi.I was diagnosed with bilateral blood clots in both my lungs last December 2017. I was put on Xarelto for 6 months. I just came off of it in June.I originally went to the doctor for chest pain that I get almost daily, he ordered a D-dimer test and from there I was told about the blood clots in my lungs - ended up being from my birth control.I am now off the blood thinners and am having chest pains again.. always on the left side right above my heart.It feels as if someone is taking a metal pipe and angling at 45° and ramming it into my heart/chest area. Like hard pressure.. I don't know how else to explain it. It gets worse when I inhale, especially if I take deep breaths.I got another d-dimer test done and it came back negative. Any ideas?"

Heart Attack,"Multiple ectopic/pvcs in a row, scared of sudden death","I'm 22 year old female, have had several ecg coming back and also a heart ultrasound a couple of years ago and my heart is ""healthy"". I've been experiencing pvcs since I was 14 years old. I became used to them and knew they werent dangerous adding the fact that they only happened thrice or 4 times a year but right now they're becoming more frequent, like 3 times a week and today I had two so far.The other thing that is terrifying is that I'm getting these weird fluttering sensations and it feels like I'm having like 10 pvcs in a row - one right after the other and I get a mini panic attack and feel like I'm gonna pass out or aomething.  When I experience this my heart feels like it's beating 200 beats per minute and I have to cough everytime to stop them.As an anxiety sufferer I googled and what I read terrified me.

Heart Attack,"Sternum pain, 10 months post OHS","I had my third OHS in November and the recovery went great for the most part; no sternum complications.About 24 hours ago, I noticed that my chest hurt when I took a deep breath or pressed on my sternum.  I do not have shortness of breath so I honestly chalked it up to heartburn (even though I don't typically get that), took a zantac with a glass of water, and went to bed.This morning, I woke up feeling like someone kicked me in the sternum. It hurts to breathe, hurts when I move my arms, and the left side of my chest hurts worse when I lightly press it compared to the right (though, the right a bit hurts, as well).  The pain radiates mostly from the left side and I feel it radiating in my left shoulder if I take a deep breath or bend a certain way.  Again, I do NOT have any shortness of breath and all of my previous surgeries were due to CHD so I'm not concerned about anything life threatening.I am wondering if anyone has ever experienced a broken sternum wire and if what I'm describing sounds like what they felt?I left a message with my doctor so I'll hear back from them later but I wanted to hop onto a forum to see if anyone else could relate in the meantime.Thanks!"
Heart Attack,Can you feel a blood clot moving in your body? ,"For those of you that have experienced blood clots, can you feel one moving through your body and how badly does it hurt if it's blocking a vein or artery?  I've experienced a sort of tension along my outer left arm bone, close to the elbow that feels like a bad muscle ache, no extreme pain.  This has lasted anywhere from hours to mere seconds.  Idk what this is and I'd love some input from you guys. I'm so scared of dying in my sleep from this or keeling over out of the blue.For those of you that have experienced blood clots, can you feel one moving through your body and how badly does it hurt if it's blocking a vein or artery?

Heart Attack,Waking up in the middle of the night gasping for air,"Has anybody ever experienced this before? Over the past year I've been experiencing a lot of unsettling symptoms (severe shortness of breath, PVCs, palpitations, all of which get worse upon exertion) and have seen a cardiologist, got a full workup with all the tests (stress, ekg, holter monitor, TEE) and they couldn't find anything. I even saw a pulmonologist who told me I was experiencing irregular breathing but he hasn't really diagnosed it (just gave me and inhaler, which didn't improve anything).  But recently, I've been having a new symptom. I'll go to sleep at night, and a few hours later I'll wake up gasping for air, like I'm being suffocated.  My breaths are extremely short and it feels like I'm unable to get anough oxygen, which wakes me up.

Heart Attack,Heart rate,"I was just wondering if anyone had any ideas as to what’s going on with my body.In January I started developing palpitations.All day, every day I got PVCs that were detected on my holter monitoring.Over 20,000 in 24 hours.Which was about 18% of my heart beats.My cardio wasn’t worried.He just gave me 20mg daily of propranolol and sent me on my way.This helped for the anxiety of the PVCs but it didn’t stop them at all.I went back to him when I started to get bigeminy, trigeminy and constant runs of Pvcs at resting heart rate.I constantly went to the ER about this but they too weren’t too concerned.I had 1 episode where my heart raced so fast out of control that I had to call an ambulance, it lowered quickly but was scary as hell.My cardio upped my propranolol 1x week 30mg morning and night then after that 1x week 40mg morning and night.I started to feel okay.I could tolerate work, I work in retail at a large supermarket in the deli so I’m walking around all day and very busy.Some days the propranolol helped reduce the Pvcs or at least suppress them.I’ve never had a fast heart rate before unless I was walking/moving/excercising.But something I did notice even when I first got my PVCS was my heart rate would shoot right up whenever I ate anything and the Pvcs were way worse after eating.I told every ER doctor this and my cardio but no one had put any relation to eating and Pvcs so I have stopped eating for the longest time.I would eat something very small for dinner then not eat for another 5 days or so because my Pvcs are always really bad after I eat anything.I still got them but no way as bad as I got them after I ate anything, plus my heart rate would get a little higher after I ate too even on propranolol.It feels better to be Hungary than to suffer from Pvcs all day.So anyway, I had gone back to the cardio because I was still getting heaps of Pvcs, he again upped my propranolol to 40mg 3x times daily.That suppressed the sensation of my Pvcs and kept my heart rate normal but it also exaggerated the Pvcs severely, I started to get rebound Pvcs or escape beats, which are even more Pvcs on higher doses of beta blockers.He weaned me of theses down to 80mg, then back down to 40mg daily.Then he gave me veripamil to start instead of the beta blockers, he thought a calcium channel blocker would work better.I went in last week for an endoscopy to check my constant stomach problems, and the doctors found I have peptic ulcers.I finally have an answer to why me stomach hurts.I started my CCb the day after my procedure, it didn’t work at all, I had a racing heart beat all day.I tried eating on the veripamil and as soon as I did, my heart rate shot right up, and large amount of Pvcs started. I have an app on my phone which gives me heart rate (paid app, works really accurately).It’s strange, I suffered from Pvcs all the time but now they really only came about whenever I stood up and walked around or when my heart rate would go up.I woke up early the next morning and I felt my heart racing, and started to get runs of Pvcs again, which is so scary.I tried to calm myself but the moment I got up and walked around my heart started to race to crazy high levels.About 160bpm, so I called an ambulance and was taken to hospital.I was checked out and they toldMe that I had to go back toMy cardio because this medication obviously wasn’t working.When I was hooked up to the monitor I did notice my heart rate went from 72 to 100bpm when I was lying down, I got a huge increase of Pvcs and it flashed that I had just had NSVT.Never had this happened to me, even when I started getting PVCS I never had huge heart rate increases like this, I also never got runs of Pvcs at high heart rates either.And never had NSVT been seen to me whilst I was in the ER, which was a lot of the time.I blew this off to changing medications, the next day I took veripamil again.I noticed that I had a high heart rate and an awareness of my heart beat all day.The same thing happened, I woke up around 2am to go to the toilets and bam!Same thing, huge Pvcs and runs of them and super fast heart beats for about 5 minutes.I tried to calm down after that but I was so panicked, I just payed down all day.Whenever I sat down it felt way better, the moment I stood up and walked, my heart rate went psycho.So I went to my GP and told him what’s been happeneing, and he told me to stop veripamil and take my propranolol 40mg daily again.It should help until I get in to see my cardio which was lucky that I could get In on Monday.So I started back on propranolol.It helped to reduce the anxiety I was having even more so from those strange fast heart rate episodes, but I still noticed that whenever I went from laying/standing or walking my heart rate would shoot up again.Anyway, I made it to the cardio on Monday however on the 2.5 hour one way drive to my cardio, I had another episode of super fast heart rate when I was driving.It happened all of a sudden, everything seems dark, I thought I was going to die.But I managed to pull it together, and kept driving, just focusing on my breathing.I got to the cardio office and told him what’s been happening.ThatMy Pvcs have stopped except whenever I stand or walk around, which is strange that I had thousands to not many only when my heart rate shoots up and I have these strange fast heart beats episodes.He gave me a holter moniter again and he wanted to see what my heart was doing.He also upped my propranolol again to 80mg.My cardio suspects POTS, so when I get my holter results he is doing the tilt test.I have been on the propranolol for 80mg for a few days, and I have really noticed that my heart rate still shoots up wheever I lay/sit and stand/walk.This has never happened to me before.The propranolol helps keep my heart rate great when sitting but it races and won’t lower whenever I’m up and about doing things.Plus I keep getting runs of pvcs, which I had not had since I first started in January.I haven’t had any strange fast heart rate episodes again since the other day, which I a plus.I’m so bother about this, what could it be other than POtS???I don’t have many symptoms of POTS syndrome, only the heart rate thing.I was hoping it could be something else.I have searched for answers everywhere but no luck.Would any other illness/problems be causing this????????I never want POtS and I hope ornaments could be something else.Plus I have a million blood tests, all levels of everything are okay.Nothing stands out.However, I haven’t been eating well for a few months.I don’t eat because the Pvcs were bad but now I can’t eat because my heart rate shoots up.I’ve lost 45kg since January and I feel so crap.mi also don’t drink that much, which I really should increase my water.I just want some ideas from anyone if they might know what could be causeing this strange heart rate pattern other than POTS????????Please help"

Heart Attack,Only 16..?,"My whole life I have noticed a few odd problems from time to time. Next to that, well receiving medical training (through a program- because I am interested in that for the future.) I was told by the certified nurse that I should seek and look into a pace maker or A1c.She told me this because very randomly I get the most discombobulating dizziness- very quickly comes on for almost no reason seemingly. Next to just that... I have never been able to take hot showers because I WILL pass out. And on only 2 occasions I have passed out immediately after a sporting event. (I am fairly active and run a 1-3 miles daily and participate in track at my school.) I also tend to experience breathlessness when I am laying down and I feel like my heart is in my brain during that.No one in my family is listening to this, and I just wanted to make sure that these issues CAN wait to be looked into or if I should be extremely urgent with these thing, and what may be happening to me.

Heart Attack,Undiagnosable heart problem; please help me.,"I am a 25 year old male, 74 kgs, 5ft11. I have always been very physically active, working out several times a week, watching my diet, etc. I have used drugs sporadically, cocaine and mdma maybe a total of 10 times in my life.Since 6 months ago, I am unable to do any exercise. Nothing at all, even standing up from the couch to take a glass of water sends my heart rate to 110 and gives me bad chest pressure and throat tightness. I am very short of breath easily. As a former athlete, I think i kind off know my own body, and i feel that this is not normal at all. I used to be able to run 10kms, barely breaking a sweat. Symptoms have gotten worse over the past few weeks where i am now short of breath lying on my back or belly, and can only breathe/sleep properly lying on my left side. I am unable to take care of myself like this. I had to quit my job, i can't do anything. The pressure in my chest can get really bad, up until the point i am barely able to breathe.I visited several cardiologist and gotten nearly every test they had to offer. I had several echo's, EKG's, stress tests, blood work, an angiogram (they did not check my left heart chamber as i had artery spasms) and a CT scan of my chest. All came back fine. However symptoms continue to get worse. I feel like i'm dying, with my body tolerating less and less every day.I get chest palpitations which make me feel like my heart might stop at any moment.I am getting truly desperate. The only explanation i was given is anxiety/hyperventilation. However, hyperventilation was ruled out by bloodwork, several doctors and a well known physiotherapist. As for anxiety, i am convinced this is not the problem, as i generally feel relaxed. Also, i have tried Xanax several times as i was prescribed this for the anxiety, but it did not cure my symptoms at all. Also, an endoscopy ruled out anySymptoms summary:Chest pressurePalpitationsFatigueThroat tightness (sometimes feels like my throat is closing)Shortness of breath(can only breathe properly when lying on my left side)Dizzy, weakVery high heart rate, does not seem to recover like it did before (used to recover fairly quickly after running, now it stays elevated very long after going up a single flight of stairs).Please, if anyone has even the slightest input.

Heart Attack,Looking for advice. Possible bradycardia ,Hi everyone. I’m starting this thread in some guidance and hopefulness. I recently had an 4 day eeg/ekg. Reading the report there were multiple notes suggesting bradycardia.  I’m 39 years old.   I have 3 little boys and a wife that is trying her best to put up with me. I’ll admit I’m scared. Not knowing what the future holds but I need some honesty here. I’m a smoker but quitting now. Spent the last 20 years in a stressful job. Don’t drink. Not enough to say I’m a drinker. I’ve started recently eating healthier. I don’t consider myself overweight. Around 200 lbs. I’m roughly 6’0. I guess my question is if I’m asked to put in a pacemaker do I say yes?  Or does diet and routine exercise take care of problems like this?  
Heart Attack,Abnormal heart beat at night ,"Please help! For the past few months, every single night, I have constant moments where my heart races, for hours. I feel like it has been getting worse. I then decided to start taking Melatonin to help me sleep, but it barely works anymore. When I noticed it stopped working, I bought some Zzzquil and used it as well. I then decided to use both Melatonin and Zzzquil, and for awhile they both helped me sleep with no problem other than occasional drowsiness. Now they barely work anymore. If I don’t use Melatonim and Zzzquil, I’ve noticed when I’m falling asleep I have a hypnotic jerk. It feels like my heart slows down to a normal pace as I’m going to sleep, but shoots back up when I’m about to actually fall asleep. If I didn’t have these medicines, it would happen all night for hours. Please help!!! I can not find a solution online and have not seen a doctor. I am 18 years old. "

Heart Attack,Heart palpitations...scared,"I'm very scared. I know I have anxiety and sometimes I honestly feel like I have it under control and some days I cry all day because of how I feel. But I feel my heart skip a beat and I get very scared. I know this is normal for anxiety, but I can't get the scared feeling,out of my system.Just now I was googling atrial fibrillation and I'm thinking to myself what it I have that! Then a heart attack or a stroke is a risk with this. I see a cardiologist next week but I'm scared of the results. I'm only 19 and I feel like I can't have fun anymore. I miss being a kid because I didn't worry bout all of this. Now that my dad had his stroke all I think about is the worse possible situation.Yesterday I picked my mom up from work and when we came home I went straight to my room to check my blood pressure because I didn't check it all day. It was 122/78 heart rate at 74 but the little indicator showed that my heartbeat was irregular. It was a little hot when we came home and I was sitting in the Sun for her to get out. Anyways I saw this and immediately started to panic, I wasnt feeling fatigued or pain, or tired or dizzy, no shortness of breath, no weakness (usually symptoms of a fib) I waited a few minutes maybe 5 and did it again and it was in the 110s/60s I think heart rate still in the 70s but no irregular heart beat indication.Then this morning I woke up fine and I watched tv in the living room waited for my mom and dad to get dressed for therapy, and sitting still and then I felt my heart skip a beat or something. Again I had no symptoms but I'm still afraid because in was reading about a fib. I'm afraid to workout because of this. I have a heart rate monitor thingy on my phone where you put your finger over the lens and the pulses look fine, but there's a heart thingy on it that shows the ""heart beat"" nd sometimes it skips a beat. Btw the app is called Instant Heart Rate by Azumio and idk if its accurate or not so idk if the results are correct"

Heart Attack,I might have heart issues but i'm not sure exactly ,"Yesterday was my first time donating blood after getting rejected 2 years consecutively for high blood pressure or fast pulse rate (can't rmb which) I am a female, 20 this year and weigh 45kg. My BP was 134/81 and pulse rate 99/min. I was cleared during the medical checkup thus was able to donate blood. But i went home to check that my BP was considered high for my age and that it is stage 1 hypertension. I know i was pretty anxious while my blood pressure was taken but i get anxious over some things in every day life as well so i've noticed my heart racing at times.Can someone please advise if this is normal? I don't pay attention to my diet & don't exercise regularly, maybe i should start doing so... "
Heart Attack,Chest discomfort,"I am a 32 year old male with 65 kg weight. I walk everyday for 45 min and my blood pressure is 120/80. I have discomfort in chest for the past one month and with shortness of breath on exertion for one week. Two weeks ago, I have done ECG, 2d Echo, TMT and chest x-ray tests. All came normal. These reports were cross-verified by two cardiologists and one general physician and declared normal. I am not able to find the reason. Can someone suggest what is causing these issues?"
Heart Attack,"Uncomfortable, Heavy Feeling in Chest with Heart Palpitations- What is This?","Hi, So I'll start off by saying I'm 280lbs and 5f8, female, 27years old. I've been big like this for over six years, weight gain brought on from Binge Eating Disorder. It's under control now, I'm starting to lose weight, anyway my issue now is my heart.?About a year or two ago, I began noticing it felt hard to lie down. I'd be watching tv, laying down and my heart would feel heavy. No pain, just discomfort. Being the idiot that I was, I just put up with it until very recently, only now the problems gotten worse. These are my symptoms:?1. Heart palpitations. My heart beats fast sometimes, but slow and steady other times. It beats harder too, if that makes sense, like I can see it beating. This goes on for a few minutes, ten max, and usually lying down, doing some kind of strenuous activity and stress/anxiety bring it on.??2. It is so uncomfortable to lie down. I'll lie down on my back and then I feel this uncomfortable sensation in my heart (it's much worse than how I felt lying down a year ago. In fact, it's almost painful). So I move to my left side, same thing. Then the right, and again, same thing. It doesn't happen every time I lie down, but when it does it has all my attention.?3. Sometimes I'll get this strange pain by my heart, but near my throat, and occasionally, but not as much, other parts of my heart.?I went to the cardiologist, did an EKG and ultrasound and it was ""fine"", so what is this? I have to wear a moniter for a few weeks and then go back for a stress test. My biggest fear is years of leading an unhealthy, inactive lifestyle have ruined my heart and I'm so scared at any time I'm going to have a heart attack or stroke from this. I can't relax and I'm anxious all the time, which only makes the problem worse. I just don't feel like I used to, I feel different. I know somethings wrong, but I don't know what and because of that I don't know how serious this is.?Things I should mention: My mom had a stroke early this year due to atrial fibrillation. From what I've read online, that is an ""abnormal heart rhythm"" and etc, is that what this could be? I don't know, I'm so scared.?It's scared me so bad that I've started eating a heart healthy diet, and walking in order to be healthier. What other things can I do to ward off having a heart attack or to make these symptoms better?One more thing. I don't know if this is related, my doctor thinks it's just a muscle, but I've been getting this pain in my boob/chest area that's made worse whenever I'm anxious.

Heart Attack,Emotional aftereffects of Open Heart Surgery? ,"Hello all.  A little over 5 years ago I had triple bypass surgery.  At that time I was working at a local hospital and when I went back to work following the surgery I was talking to a nurse who asked me if I felt depressed.  Surprisingly enough she was right, I did feel depressed, and she proceeded to tell me that anyone who has open heart surgery experiences the emotional trauma similar to a broken heart.  I suffered greatly after the surgery and had to stay in the hospital twice as long as most patients due to complications.  The entire experience really rocked me to my core.  Now it's 5 years later and I'm still not over it.  Not only am I severely depressed I have gained about 50 lbs since having the surgery, which isn't a good thing to have when you have a heart condition.  So I'm wondering if anyone else who may be reading this that has had open heart surgery is experiencing anything similar?  I'd be interested in what you've been going through.  Thanks.Hello all.  A little over 5 years ago I had triple bypass surgery.  At that time I was working at a local hospital and when I went back to work following the surgery I was talking to a nurse who asked me if I felt depressed.  Surprisingly enough she was right, I did feel depressed, and she proceeded to tell me that anyone who has open heart surgery experiences the emotional trauma similar to a broken heart.  I suffered greatly after the surgery and had to stay in the hospital twice as long as most patients due to complications.  The entire experience really rocked me to my core.  Now it's 5 years later and I'm still not over it.  Not only am I severely depressed I have gained about 50 lbs since having the surgery, which isn't a good thing to have when you have a heart condition.  So I'm wondering if anyone else who may be reading this that has had open heart surgery is experiencing anything similar?  I'd be interested in what you've been going through.  Thanks."

Heart Attack,"Convinced these are warning signs of imminent heart attack, please help!","For the past two months I’ve been having debilitating attacks where my husband takes me to the ER because I’m convinced I’m having a heart attack. I’m a 25 year old, not overweight, non smoker without diabetes or any other known illnesses. I’ve had a follow up with a cardiologist, a perfect stress test, perfect ct angiograph and blood work. These attacks have gotten so bad that it is now constant, from when I wake up til when I fall asleep. I had to quit my job. I am MISERABLE. My symptoms all day are: constant nausea/indigestion Heart palpitations Chest pressureIncredible upper back pain that spreads til the middle backNeck pain Jaw painPain that goes down both arms and hands (kind of tingling and burning)Aching ears (sometimes ringing)Shortness of breathWhen I look this up on the internet it tells me YOU ARE HAVING A HEART ATTACK GO TO THE HOSPITAL!! But my cardiologist insists it’s not my heart! So I’m going to see a gastroenterologist and a hematologist and a rheumatologist but I’m the meantime I’m wondering could this all be psychological??? Is anyone else like me??? Is this stress manifesting? NO MEDICINE IS HELPING! I have barely been able to eat or sleep in weeks. The back pain is so bad in the mornings it wakes me up every single morning. Please help!! Should I keep going to a cardiologist? "

Heart Attack,Pain Under left Breast ? Please Reply ASAP,"Well First of I'm new here so Hi Everyone!My name is Bianca. Before I get started here's a few details in case your in need of any for this question.Weight : 8.5 StoneAge : 25I have been getting a pain under my left breast that feels like a bruise when pressed lightly. I also keep getting a sharp pain somewhere in that region but can't tell if it's my heart or something else which feels very unconformable to the point I may have to move. My Arm does feel slightly different sometimes when this happens and is brought on when sit and relaxing.About 3 years ago I started getting heart palpitations, went to the GP and was told is was down to stress. I did go again and had a heart monitor put on by my local hospital but they never got back to me or my GP about the results.The Palpitations happen randomly and can last from a week to 2 weeks.I also suffer from IBS and have done for about 7 years, when this plays up I feel tired and my heart palpitations can worsen.I've also been on the pill for 5 years and changed to the coil for the last 3 years to currently.As I used to get irregular periods every 2 months (Had a hormonal test and there slightly of key)When I was on the pill this helped but with my coil I've had no period in 3 years. Though I can still get pain and slight blood.sometimes I get twitch's in my left arm or legs.I also get a weird feeling in my left arm like its aching.I've put in as many details as I can to help rule out the curse.Just to add I've been getting this pain for about 4 days now and I'm scared...Thanks for any helpBianca"

Heart Attack,"Chest Pain, Upper back pain, Left arm pain","Hello I am a 26yo Asian male. Not a smoker too. Ever since mid 2016, I had been encountered suddenly cases of mild pain on my chest, upper back and left arm. Sometimes together at the same time, sometimes separate incident.During 2016 and 2017, I had visited the GP doctors a lot of times, did a lot of EKG (Probably nearly 10 times), blood test, urine test and X ray which all the tests came back fine. I even visited 2 different cardiologist did stress ekg, 2d echo and ct coronary angiogram and they are all fine as well. Totally 0 blockage from the ct coronary angiogram test.After that I just assume it is anxiety and just ignore it and it has been better for like nearly a year and now it has came back. Some days I get a pain down my left hand that last the whole day. Sometimes I suddenly feel a bit of light headed, upper back pain and left hand pain for 1-2 hour although I am just sitting down and not doing any stressful activity. This week I get a tingling feeling on my left leg that lasts for a few days. Should I be worry after all the tests I had done a year ago? I don't really want to visit the doctors again because of my long record of visiting them, they usually just call off as anxiety without tests. "

Heart Attack,Meds are making me unwell ,Hi and thanks for reading this. I had a nonstem1 heart attack 4 weeks ago. I am 47 slightly overweight but always active. The hospital has put me on a fairly massive medication regime but I feel worse than when I actually had my heart attack. I feel sick and dizzy all the time. I can’t focus my eyes and they are blood shot. I feel depressed. Should I cut down my meds myself as I don’t feel like I am getting any real advice from the professional people. Ps was really quite fit and active before my “event” 
Heart Attack,Weird internal body vibrations?,"I'm 21 year old male and for the past 6 months I been having this weird vibrations around the body. First I through it was Heart related and I went to a cardiologist to see if it was my heart. The cardiologist said that I have a harmless Arrhythmia and is nothing to worry about and intervention is not needed, the other cardiologist that made me the strength exercise said everything looks good.Now, the vibrations happen everywhere, chest, arms, legs, feet, and sometimes waist, It's getting to the point where it affects me on my sleep.What could this be? Is very fast vibrations, like if a cell phone was ringing inside my body.Again, I'm not sure if this is 100% heart related.What do you guys think? No I do not drink coffee, and no energy drinks. It happens randomly, I through it could be stress, but it happens sometimes when I'm not even thinking about anything, like watching a movie.I seriously do not know at this point.Stress? Anxiety? again it happens even when I'm relaxed. Gastritis? The heart? I told my cardiologist about it but I forgot what he said, it said something about excitement, but again it happens even when I'm calm.You guys think is heart related? It happens everywhere, and is very fast, like a bubble bursting inside or something. As far as I know I do not have any kinds of disorders either, and I'm not overweight or anything.I guess this is enough information, I do not have diabetes, I had a medical check about 9 months ago and everything came out good."
Heart Attack,Any suggestions based on symptoms? 2 month wait till next doctor meeting ,"So a quick summary; I'm 18, and was physically active and well until I was struck down with chest pain back in January. Since then I get regular stabbing pains with no obvious trigger, located around my heart on the surface, deep within the ribs and in my back behind where my hear sits. This is accompanied by shortness of breath, dizziness and weakness. ECGs, echocardiograms, and more blood tests than I can count have all failed to find a cause. I'm asking on here after a particularly horrific episode of pain tonight that lasted 2 hours despite my regular painkillers (which I'm advised to take 2-3 times a day every day). Anyone any any suggestions on what this could be, what I could try for relief or what to do? My next hospital appointment isn't til August and my current gp situation makes it hard to speak to a doctor "
Heart Attack,Can any1 help xxx,Hi guys so just wondering if any1 can help. Every time i drink alcohol i get awful palpitations and like a stabbing in my chest fir days afterwards.

Heart Attack,"Purple hands, fuzzy head, wobbly legs and exhaustion.","Mum, who is 75 in August, gets purple hands, a fuzzy head, her legs feel like they will go from under her and feels exhausted if she just goes for a short walk; so she is effectively housebound.  She also coughs quite a lot.  She only has a clear head when she's  lying down; the rest of the time it's fuzzy.  She was exhibiting all these symptoms, except the exhaustion, up till 3 months ago, when she caught a virus from me which laid her low for a month and since then she has had all of the above symptoms, including the exhaustion.  She has had an echocardiogram and a scan and they haven't revealed a heart problem, she is now awaiting the results of chest x-rays and blood tests.  Many years ago, in the 80's, she had myocarditis quite badly.  Any idea what is ailing her and what would cure her?"
Heart Attack,please help. I cant takie it anymore,"Hi, I do apologize that this may be a little longIm a 20 year old male, no family history of heart disease, do not smoke, drink, or do drugsI have suffered with heart fluttering since I was about 14 years old. However, they have gotten a lot worse in the last few months. They now last up to 7 seconds at a time and make me really dizzy. Here is my history of doctors this year.1.) Cardiologist 1 (November) - she did an echo-cardiogram and said everything was fine2.) Cardiologist 2 (January) - stated that he thought I may have an abnormal heart rhythm3.) Cardiologist 3 (January) - I went to him for a second opinion after the cardiologist told me he saw something wrong--> this cardiologist did multiple ECGs, and a 30 day Event monitor. During the Event monitor I had minor chest flutters but these only lasted 1-2 seconds each. He said he did not find anything wrong.4.)Cardiologist 2 AGAIN (went back) - he then said he didn't see anything wrong and he said "" I do not think it is anything serious but i will send you to an electrophysiologist to make sure). I chose not to go because my insurance would not have covered anymore tests since I have done so many already.Throughout these months I also made 5 trips to the ER and got blood work done, 4 chest x-rays, and a total of 8 ECGS. With each visit they did not find anything wrong.Does anyone else experience these long-lasting chest flutters? Do you know what causes them? Did I make a mistake by not going to the Electrophysiologist? I am so terrified that this is an abnormal heart rhythm and that I will go into sudden cardiac arrest. "
Heart Attack,Heart attack symptoms for two weeks constantly?,"Hi, I’m a 25 year old female 95 lbs non smoker non diabetic no known illnesses. For the past two weeks I have been very ill with what seem like constant classic heart symptoms. I wake up nauseasted and have extreme indigestion all day long. I can barley sleep now, I sleep 2-3 hours a night. I can barely eat. I have tingling arms and hands on both sides, neck pain, occasional jaw and deep ear pain. Very bad upper back pain and burning center chest pain.These are all CONSTANT! I’m so sick I had to quit my job...I’m incapacitated.Here’s the thing, when I started having all these symptoms, I had multiple EKG’s, a stress test and an angiogram and blood tests that all came back comepley normal with zero chance of a heart attack. I asked my cardiologist about the possibility of Coronary Microvasculad Disease since that isn’t detected on these tests, and she said it doesn’t present this way and something would’ve pointed to a decreased oxygen level during any of these tests to lead her to believe I may have MVD. So I sit here in pain, none of these anti anxiety / anti acid prescriptions I’ve been given have helped these symptoms. It’s still constant all day, every day. I’m terrified of an impending heart attack. I can’t eat or sleep.Please help, has this happened to anyone else? Thank you "

Heart Attack,Signs of heart failure?,"I'll start off in March of 2017, I was resting at home and out of no where I started to notice my heart beat more than in the past. It felt as if it was getting harder and harder, so of course I panic, and drive myself to the E.R. I tell them I think I'm having a heart attack (btw I'm almost 21 at this point, 6'2 195 male, went to the gym 6 days out of the week, and never had any medical conditions.) So they check my blood pressure, run an EKG on me, and both came back fine. They put me in a bed and take some blood samples, and the tests they ran on my blood came back fine as well. So they did not officially rule it as a panic attack on paper, but they were saying that was most likely I was dealing with. Ever since then, it's never been the same. Certain things I watch make me uneasy at times, and sometimes it gets hard to breathe, especially laying down. It's rare, but once in a while I'll jolt myself awake as I'm about to go to sleep because I don't feel myself breathing (if that makes sense?) Did some research and I came across sleep apnea. Then that was related to possibly heart failure. So now I'm worried that I might have that, since due to HF, fluids are stored in the lungs, making it harder to breathe. As far as I know, I don't have heart failure running through either side of my family. I'm still very active, go to the gym, and play basketball 3 or 4 times a week. So is it possible for a 22 year old male to have either apnea or heart failure at this age? I will greatly appreciate any answers.

I felt like I was going to die, panic running through my body, etc. So I drove myself to the hospital and they ran an EKG on me and it came back fine. They take me back and did blood work and they came back too. So they ruled it as an anxiety attack. Ever since then I have felt more aware of my heart beat, and occasionally I feel like my heart makes a harder beat and it freaks me out. Every time I drink coffee or an energy drink I feel very on edge and anxious. And after drinking a caffeine-filled drink, I have chest discomfort and i feel a burp is stuck in my esophagus. When I lay down, it gets a little harder to breathe and the discomfort is there too. So I have to get up and walk around in order for that feeling to go away.

Heart Attack,Heart attack? Angina? Going crazy?,"I’m 16 years old 17 in a few months . About 3 weeks ago I started to feel chest pains randomly whilst sitting down then heart squeezing and light headness , acid up my throat etc. i thought i was going to die , convinced i soon was to have a heart attack rushed to Emergency , he assured me it was just a panic attack he did measure my blood pressure and it was slighlty high but he said due to the fact i was terrified he gave a little warning just to keep on eye on myself . The reason also why im so worried is because ive developed over the years a bad habit . Eating . Therefore i now weigh over 300 pounds , however ive got my stuff together and now am losing weight with slimming world  and generally making the better decisions but because of this i am still not convinced it was just a panic attack because my weight definetely strains against my health . So after that day i did feel “better” but i just had this weird feeling like feeling sick and that squeezing heart , i learned to focus on other things but it just seems not to go away i keep having chest  pains , now its developed to my back my arm my shoulder like what the even , im not sure if this my brain or i actually need help , im genuinely scared to fall asleep keep feeling sick and full even without eating im just not sure sometimes feeling dizzy and blurry vision  what should i do ? Can heart attack symptoms last for 3 weeks because its almost like im ticked each one off the list ."
Heart Attack,Did I have a heart attack? ,"I have intense anxiety and I started medicine for it about a month ago. (Buspar twice daily) Most of that anxiety is related to medical problems I think I have. My family has a history of heart related problems. My father has heart disease, diabetes, blood pressure problems, and ect. I’ve had heart palpitations before and they usually only happen one at a time, the other night at work I had several strong ones at once taking my breath away. Since then the middle of my chest has hurt and I have palpitations when I lay down at night. Did I have a heart attack? I just had an EKG less than a month ago and they said nothing was out of the ordinary, is it just my anxiety? I’m a fairly healthy 22 year old with no prior conditions, never even had any surgeries. Only been in the hospital once when I was 11 for pneumonia. "

The thing that actually worries me is what happens afterward. For like 2 hours after the episode my heart skips beats constantly. Like every 30 seconds and it hurts. It also slows down then flutters and starts back up. I've already had a ECG and wore and event monitor and they didn't find anything. I'm just really scared that my heart is going to stop after these episodes. They are so painful and scary but I don't know what they are. I do need to mention that these used to happen after my SVT episode all the time but they weren't as bad as yesterday. Please help me?!?!?Hello!

Heart Attack,I'm afraid of a heart attack,"Hello, i'm a 17 year old male that has a concern about his heart for about 2 years now, it started off with chest pains, now I get all sorts of symptoms. Whats gotten me to write this is what i've experienced just now. I was sitting getting shoulder pain and worrying and all of the sudden I've felt a weird sensation in my chest where my heart is. It felt like my heart is struggling or palpitating I jumped putting my hand on my chest i couldn't feel anything for a second and then my heart rate speed up and I could hear my heart loudly in my ears i started walking around the house I've checked my BP it was over 160/80 or something like that, but it went down in minutes back to normal. I don't know how to cope with this. I've been to couple of places to get my heart tested, numerous ECG's have been done and came back just fine. I've had one echo done which came back as a mild aortic valve regurgitation but other than that i've been told I don't need any medicine and my heart muslce is strong. They've advised me to come back next year. I'm waiting for another Echo which is at 25th of June. Sometimes it gets better, and I got more active outdoors, running fast causes my chest to hurt, the pain gets worse as i breathe in and stops short after I stop running or if i run slower. Sometimes I do feel sick randomly or short of breath, but that's when I'm having a stressful day usually. I don't know what to do anymore and I feel like i can die any minute, I don't know what i'm going to achieve posting this but I guess I'm looking for reassurance.

Heart Attack,Left arm pain and jaw pain,"Hi For the last 3 months i had been having jaw pains and left arm pain. 3 months ago i started having chest pain as well and went to a cardiologist who said my heart is fine and both angina and a heart attack seem unlikely given I'm 21 years old healthy and in good shape. An ecg echocardiogram chest x ray and blood work was done and as regards to the chest pain, it happens after i touch it so i was given anti inflammation pills for that to heal. I'm scared that i might have angina given the hand pain and jaw pain but my chest is healing up. what should i do?To say Everything since I'm still a student i was having anxiety because of my thesis and exams but all that anxiety is much better.Thanks"
Heart Attack,Real problem or anxiety,I am having either real heart problems or anxiety.  I am worried about which it is.  Facts:Severly overweight (almost 400 pounds)38 years oldTaking medication for high bp - highest tested was about 150/95 - with medication it is usually around 130/80Cholesterol is 111 ldl / 27 hdlTriglycerides are 169Very sedentary lifestyle because I am scared if i have a heart problem exercise will trigger itHaving chest pain sometimes - alot of shoulder pain.   Shoulder pain occurs mostly with moving but sometimes when not but definitely gets worse with movinghad a stress test in march that came back with no problems but i fear they missed itresting heart rate according to fitbit is 73 Long story short is that the chest/arm/shoulder pain coupled with my weight makes me worry that I do have heart problems that were missed.  Please let me know your thoughts.  Should I trust my feelings or my Dr?  What are the odds that chest and shoulder/arm pain at my size are unrelated to heart?  I am racking up medical bills and not finding answers.  Should I take this to mean it is all in my head or trust my instincts and find a new dr who will find the cause?
Heart Attack,Red blotches on the tips of my nails,"I've been monitoring these and they have come and gone over the past two weeks.

Heart Attack,I have been feeling weird sensations with my head and heart. ,"Hello everyone my name is Aaron. I have been recently experiencing some weird symptoms. For no  reason I will feel head pressure along with a feeling of numbness in my head. I also sometimes get cold sensations in my head. I have had a cat scan and just got my mri done a couple of days ago. I have not gotten the results back but am hoping for the best. Now to get to the issues with my heart.  I notice sometimes i have numbness in the chest sometime on the left sometimes  on the right, also sometimes it seems located near the sternum.  I also have palpitations and what feels like pvcs as well.  Had multiple tests done.  Chest xray, echocardiogram,ekg, and also worn an event monitor.  Everytime they say nothing is wrong.  But these past 3 years my breathing has gotten very bad.  Along with the palpitations and other stuff.  The head pressure recently started 2 months ago after I stopped taking my prozac for anxiety. It felt as if the medicine caused it and the symptoms stayed.  Along with this i have felt very weak and as if my muscles aren't as strong as they once were.

Heart Attack,Do You Know of Anyone Suffering with Myocarditis? ,"My story in short.  While riding my bike at an extremely slow pace. I became short of breath, dizzy and experienced numbness in my arms. Went to the emergency room told them what happened..had an ecg that came back normal, my chest xray came back normal. But thanks to the wonderful doctor he said he would like to take one more test just to be sure. It was the tell tale sign of any heart damage ..the troponin test came back at 13. quite high. Normal troponin level is 0.02. Had every drug they could give me as I was told I had an heart attack. Taken to the ICU Heart Care Unit after days days offantastic care given to me I was off to another hospital for an Angiogram to fit stents in my arteries to open up the blockages.  Came out of surgery and asked the surgeon how many stents do I have..though I led an advanced aerobics class and road my bike 14 miles 2-3 times a week, dont drink alcohol,  Logistics Coordinator of a Fruit and Veg scheme,  eat healthly. Its possible that maybe I had 1 too many curries. The surgeons response was you have pristine arteries.  Wow! Great thanks. So why all the chest pain. Well that was in April 2013, I was told I contracted a viral infection of some sort. Bed rest for two week Ibruprofen 3 times a day. The inflammation of your heart muscle and heart lining should clear up. July same thing but I was sitting down couldn't catch my breath the muscles in my arms felt like they were turning to mush. Now on 50mg of Declafenac, 16mg of Cocodemolboth 3x a day and 1 Omneprazol once a day. I am due to have my MRI Stress Profusion test soon. I just want to know is there anyone suffering with this rare heart condition? There is no cure. Footballers and otherwise healthy people die suddenly from it. Talking to my friends is pointless as they still say ""Ohh just keep watching what you eat"" ""Eat healthy foods no snacking"". It is so clear that they are not listening to me. Does anyone know of someone else that suffers with this debilitating disease? "
Heart Attack,Heart disease ,Can a ECG and blood test at the hospital detect heart disease or heart problems.

Heart Attack,Insanely increase in heart rate ,"Hi I'm a 20 year old male,not physically fit but nor am I over weight. I suffer from health anxiety and I struggle day to day with it. Last night I couldn't sleep to save my life I slept for 3 hours and woke up had food and went sleep after being awake for 5 hours for another 3-4hours. Baring in mind I usually like a 10 hour sleep with no interruptions. I recently had 2 ecgs which came back clear of anything wrong with my heart because I've had slight fluctuations in heart rate. My average resting heart rate is 60-70 and sitting is around 75 maybe more or less depending on how stressed I am. Anyways after I woke up for the 2nd time I made food and began to feel nauseous but not bad enough to be sick but it's mostly like because of how tired I was. Anyways I needed to go the shops which is a 20minute walk. My average walking heart rate is 120ish peaks up and down around that. Anyways as I was feeling really sick I didn't want to go but did anyway. Bare in mind I suffer from panic disorder and panic attacks quite regularly. Anyways I started to walk and I could feel my heart beating quite fast. I do usually notice it but it was quite fast for a change. I started to feel abit more sick and I know walking on a full stomach isn't good as it reducing blood to stomach which can lead to nausea and vomiting in extreme circumstances. I was walking for about 15 mins and my legs kind of felt of exhausted. I was already really anxious about walking because if how nauseous I felt prior. I checked my heart rate and it was 150 and I began to panic and it went upto 160. I sat down on a pile on bird seed bags and took my jacket off and tried to chill out. I had symptoms of an anxiety attack but I'm not 100percent sure. It was 160 for a minute of sitting down as I was really stressed. In a few minutes it was 130 as my mum was comforting me and then I always like to read the symptoms of a panic attack on the web. Even though I know the symptoms reading it helps me over come it more quickly. Anyways after about 10 minutes I began to feel abit better still abit nauseous like before but my heart rate was around the 90s. I called a taxi and got a lift home and within a few minutes of lying down and doing deep breathing it was in the 70s. And I felt good and relaxed. Is this cause for concern do you think or do you think it was panic attack mixed with feeling sick and a raised heart rate from walking while feeling ill which caused an panic attack?

Heart Attack,Heart rate while walking,"Well I've a very inactive 20 year old male, I'm not overweight but I'm extremely unfit as I have bad anxiety and never leave the house due to fears about my Heart, my heart rate jumps between 55 to 70 at resting.

And after 2000steps I notice my heart goes to around 140/145bpm I feel sweaty out of breath and slightly dizzy but I am walking around my garden in a circle bc of my anxiety.

Heart Attack,Misdiagnosed Arrythmia???,"Hiim 20 years oldnever drank or smokedNo family history of heart diseaseSince I was about 14 I have been getting feelings of my heart fluttering for about 1-2 seconds. However, they have recently gotten worse. Sometimes it feels like my heart is beating chaotically for up to 7 seconds straight and i get so dizzy with chest pains at times. Ive been to 3 cardiologists, a psychiatrist, and been to the ER 4 times. they are all saying that it is just anxiety. Could they have missed something? Im so scared of going into cardiac arrest. "
Heart Attack,Heart issues ,"HiI’m 55 and had asthma since I was 19 brittle asthma but it’s now under control. I started getting out of breath 2 years ago and told GP it didn’t feel like asthma but recently it’s got worse along with left sided chest pain that’s hard to describe, the pain takes my breath and happens at rest. GP decided to do a blood test and did say I’d had this test 2 years prior but it only came back slightly raised so no action was needed. I got a call a couple of weeks ago telling me I was being referred to cardiologist as my enzymes have come back raised enough to warrant action. I also have a hiatus hernia and sphincter of oddi which GP is aware of but I’ve had that a long time and I don’t get chest pains just pain into my jaw when it’s bad.Question is. What will happen at cardiologist appointment and should I be concerned?"
Heart Attack,Heart Health,"Hello, sorry if this is a dumb question, but i’m kinda anxious about it and need to make sure.If I got an EKG and a heart x-ray, the one where they put an oil on your chest and slide this thing on your chest i think, does that detect all heart diseases, heart attack possibilities and all those things?"
Heart Attack,"Health anxiety again, plus blurry vision when riding a bike? ","Back at work, and my stress/anxiety is kicking back up again. Chest tightness, blurry vision and worrying up a storm. Also something I've thought about and it's been happening the past couple days: Why does my vision get blurry when I ride my bike? I've not noticed it when I've ran or walked anywhere, but only when I ride my bike I notice my vision is slightly more blurred than usual (It's been blurry since my first panic attack back in August 2017) I don't feel stressed or anxious when riding, nor do I have chest pain or shortness of breath when riding or pushing myself while riding.  What could cause this?"
Heart Attack,Feeling Short of breath 24/7 for almost 6 months?,"I don't know what to do anymore.I'm only 20 and this thing has ruined my life.I've done Chest CTs and an Endoscopy.Nothing wrong with my lungs and stomach.Also went to psychiatric that didn't help at all with the medsI've also done ECGs and Stress Echo Test before my symptoms started.That came out normal.However, when I did the Tests I wasn't feeling short of breath.Could the ECG and Stress test miss anything ?I only felt short of breath and chest pressure after I was discharged and it continued until today.Should I redo the ECG and stress tests now?will they find anything new?"
Heart Attack,Does anyone take verapamil and flecainide together?,I’ve been on verapamil for approx 10 months for ventricular ectopics with some success but not 100%. A few months ago the ectopics came back a lot. My cardiologist has recently prescribed flecainide to take with the verapamil but every where I read about it it says it’s a major drug interaction so I’m worried to take it. Does anyone else take this combination? 
Heart Attack,Sick for 8weeks after Mexico Trip,"I am posting this in heart problems because it is the most frequent symptom I experience. I would speculate that whatever sickness I have is creating the heart problems, and not heart problems making me sick. If there is a better place to post, please move or let me know. Went on a trip from Alberta, Canada to a luxury resort in Mexico. Usually practice good habits regarding drinking water habits and hygenie while we are there. I have been the sickest of my life for 7 weeks since returning home. -Started with really bad cramps and excessive pooping (solid but 4-5 times a day) in Mexico for 4 days (April 4th), Got home and had first “episode” The first day back (April 8th). Symptoms have become increasingly worse on the bad days, averaging 1 good day, 1 bad day, 1 recovery day. - “Episode” can be described as elevated heart rate, red flushed tingling face, clammy sweaty hands, tingling in arms, short of breath, nervous. Very frequently experiencing heart rate fluctuations. These have happened when I don’t eat enough, or when I engage in too much physical activity. I could be having a “good” day and have an episode, then have what feels like a terrible hangover the next day. - left side of my body most likely to be in discomfort. This includes constant chest discomfort with spurts of pain, lower stomach pain, neck pain (can feel the artery pulsing painfully) armpit soreness, rib cage, mid back (kidney area)- light headedness getting to be more regular. Headaches with pain shooting from front of head to base of skull. Head pressure.- Low energy, very difficult to function in daily routine. Will eat lunch and have to fight through urge to sleep. - restlessness while sleeping, often waking up to elevated heart rate, uncomfortable feeling. - Have become extremely sensitive to alcohol & caffeine in coffee. Alcohol will not bother me while I’m drinking it, but I will wake up in the middle of the night to an extreme episode of racing heart, sweaty, clammy, shaky, etc... I was a regular coffee drinker before. - Seems to be symptoms matching hypoglycaemia, although the blood and glucose test came back normal. - Have had 4-5 blood tests in 8 weeks, only outlier in results being an elevated (900) pancreas level. Follow up test (48hours later) had doctor saying pancreas was back to normal. Stool and urine samples both showed no signs of bacterial infection. Chest X-ray negative. Hypotension results were regular. Waiting on results from Holter monitor. "

Heart Attack,Heart issues? Or overworking?,"Hi, first I’m a 24 year old black male. I’ve noticed lately that when I go to urinate. My heart beats a little harder than usual. I just started working two jobs. One at kfc and one the desk at a hotel. People say it could be anxiety but I’m not sure. I know know one is a doctor here but I just need opinions. I don’t really have health insurance right now and to pay for it would hurt the pocket a bit. But at this point I need answers. I also noticed when I’m in the heat for any given amount of time my arms go numb and my face tingles. I begin to shake. I also notice if I power walk my heart beats harder as well. Not faster but harder. When I get up from the toilet or walk to the bathroom I feel as if I took a short jog.  Any advice is appreciated.Also I’d like to add. When this episode happened at Walmart I looked in the mirror and noticed I was grayer than usual. I sat down next to someone that was nice enough to help me and they said I was rather grayish. Idk. But I was freaked out.  "
Heart Attack,Anxiety or what?,"Sooo I’ve been having symptoms of a heart attacks for about 4 weeks now. I would get sharp pains in the center and left side of my chest, even fuzziness. I get sharp pains down both arms but mainly in the arm. Sometime the pain in my chest is a clenching feelings, it gets really tense. The pain even creeps up my neck in my lower jaw. Sometimes a even a stabbing sensation in my heart it’s weird but all of these symptoms last for a minute or less, or if I’m doing track or playing basketball but they all go away shortly after excertion. I’ve been to the hospital at least 6 times and Had most of these symptoms like hard to breathe, chest and arm pain. I’ve had a bunch of EKG, blood test, and chest X-rays. All of these test said I had absolutely nothing wrong. I kept having them and went back they ordered an ultra sound on my way. They said they couldn’t find anything wrong, everything was good! But I still experience all of these symptoms everyday thinking my life could end at any moment. Could it be heart related, or like a blood clot or clogged artery. They said they tested for clots and they couldn’t find none! They said it was anxiety but I have physical pain and they aren’t severe pains either. I’m a 17 year old male, I’m super active I play a bunch of basketball, I do track. I eat somewhat healthy but I have been eating a bunch of fast food lately. If I had a heart problem would I even be able to do all of this active stuff bc that’s when your heart is working it’s hardest! Some say it could be a pinched nerve, my neck and back start to hurt and then I have this pain go down into my tricep area and my pinky and ring finger get numb, so I don’t know. Please tell me what’s wrong with me! "
Heart Attack,Fast heart rate,"Hello everyone .  I have always been a very nervous person and have panic attacks, usually heart related.  I have had test done and all that was found was PVC's which they tell me won't kill me   lol   while working outside yesterday i could feel my heart beating really hard.I came in and used my pulse meter, something i should never do, and my heart rate was 126.

Heart Attack,Q and T abnormality on ECG in III?,"Hi guys,I wanted to ask about something on an ECG result. Every time I have an ECG (which is quite often, due to QTC prolonging medicines I take) there is an abnormality, which gives scary automatic interpretations, however doctors are not concerned.In lead III i have what the computer says is a pathological Q wave (and it is almost as large as the R wave), which however disappears on the tracings made while holding breath.Also in lead III I have a T wave which is inverted.Doctors dismiss both as normal variants and an echo showned no wall motion abnormalities, but I do have many risk factors of heart disease, plus have been battling anxiety issues (which sometimes cause chest pain or at least the mind fools you they do), so this lead III is creeping me out.I mean the Internet also states that these are normal variants, but for peace of mind it would be nice to know why they happen in some people, are our hearts different for some reason?Thanks for any input!mike "

Heart Attack,Heart Pain,"Hi there,For the past 5 months I have been experiencing what can only be described as a dull aching sensation in my chest, more specifically where my heart is. I am a 21 year old male who is fairly active (excercise twice a week). This pain can occur 4 or 5 times a day or not at all for 2 or 3 days at a time, there's no specific reason why the pain occurs either. Sometimes I can be sat still and will feel the sudden onset of this pain. After seeing my GP around 3 months ago, he said there was nothing wrong with my heart and after listening to it put it down to muscle pain from excercising. I have experienced muscle pain like this before and I have to say this feels nothing like that type of pain. The fact that it is so specific to my heart also makes me believe it has something to do with my heart.I am very worried about this, has anyone else experienced pain like this at such a young age?Cheers Dan"
Heart Attack,Constant palpitations (feeling heartbeat),"Few months ago I was woken up in the middle of the night with my heart slightly faster.  Since then, I can always feel my heartbeat, even when resting or relaxed (55bpm).  Holt monitor showed I am having pvc's but under 1%, not very bothersome.  My sleeping now, is not very good.  Recently I have had an issue when I am trying to fall asleep, it's as thought my right arm has a slight throb in line with my heart rate causing me to move it (turnover) both arms the same sensation.Recently had a echo done and no issues came up.  I find it hard to believe that these symptoms are not caused by anything.  Not to mention I have short and extremely mild headaches, prior I never experienced any sort of headache.Has anyone experienced constant palpitations and found the issue?  Thanks!"

Heart Attack,Terrified at my ventricular tachycardia diagnosis...,"I have just been discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of 'short episodes' of VT  I don't really know the implications of this, but after having read about it, it seems quite scary, and that medication doesn't work effectively (they just prescribed me beta blockers for it).

Heart Attack,Anxiety Driven Heart Problem Question,"Hello, I am a 24 year old male. I was diagnosed in 2002-2003 I think? With Mitral Valve Prolapse. I am fairly active as I have a active style job and recently began lifting weights approx 4 days a week.For awhile now, I have had instances where my heart with just up and randomly start pounding. Not really skipping any beats except for occasionally. I've also kind of gotten lightheaded but I've never passed out or had any chest pain or any other severe symptoms.I am also very prone to health anxiety so I dont know if what I'm feeling is partially due to that or the mitral valve issue or if I have another heart problem all together.I am under a doctor's care and have visited him last week at which he placed a heart monitor on me for a period of 7 days (currently on the 5th day) and then I have an appointment for a ultrasound of my heart 2 days after the monitor comes off.Should I be concerned?? I am very scared and am asking for any help the forum can provide. I appreciate it, thank yoh!"
Heart Attack,Shop barcode scanner causing heart problems??,"My mum (60 years old) works in a retail clothing store and last week started using a new type of handheld scanner at work.  Later on that night, she could feel that her heart was beating way faster than it usually does and it felt like it was out of rhythm.   She waited a while, hoping it would sort itself but it didn't.  She took her BP at home and it was 175/115 with a rate of 150bmp.  She had always had normal BP  (on the lower side of normal) so this was very out of the norm.   She went to A&E where they put her on a drip to try and get it back to normal but this didn't work so they had to sedate her and shock her.  After the shock, her heart stopped beating for a minute so they gave her CPR and luckily got it back to beating again.  Yesterday she underwent an angiogram in the hope that it would show why it had gone crazy in the first place, but this showed up nothing at all.... apparently her heart is fine so now she's waiting for an MRI.  She asked the consultant if the scanner at work could've interfered with her heart but he said only if she'd got a pacemaker.   Just wondered if anyone had encountered/ heard of anything like this occurring at all?  Seems far-fetched, I know, but we're obviously worried as nobody can give any idea as to why her heart went crazy.  She's never encountered any health problems in the past,  she doesn't drink or smoke and is otherwise healthy.   Thanks in advance.

Heart Attack,Chest Pain! Help,"Hey guys. I'm having some chest pain that's making me really anxious. So, it's like in the middle of my chest. Close to my heart. And sometimes it feels like the pain is crawling up my neck and also around my collar bone. It's like a dull, sharp pain if that makes sense? I read online that those could be symtpoms of a heart attack, so now I'm scared. I've had this chest pain on and off for a few days. I can barely feel any pain when I walk around though. It's mainly when I'm sitting.I went to the hospital about 2 months ago where they did bloodwork, EKG, and chest ray, and everything came back normal. I also went to my primary a few days ago where they did bloodwork, but I think they were testing for anemia. Which turns out I'm still anemic. My doctors tell me I shouldn't worry, and that it's just anxiety. But I cant help but worry.I've been good for a few days in a row now which is unusual lately, but this chest pain has me worried.It's always something causing my anxiety. Whether it be heart palps, weird breathing, and now this chest pain that really concentrated at the center of my chest.Any suggestions? Or does anyone else have concentrated center chest pain with anxiety?"
Heart Attack,Heart Attack problems,"So my dad (45) had a minor heart attack this morning, we called an ambulance and they took him to a cardio hospital. They scanned him and gave him medicine, they said that the heart attack occurred due to stress/anxiety/depression. All they did was keep him in hospital for about 7 hours and then sent him back home. Its been nearly 20 hours since he was taken away Is it common for my dad to sweat slighty and have a mild pain in his left shoulder? I am really worried because i dont want anything to happen to him. "

Heart Attack,Heart pain being dismissed as nothing ,"So I've had chest pain, shortness of breath, persistent lightheadedness and fainting spells plaguing me since late November, the cardiologists verdict - anxiety disorder. How can this be possible, I've been told I had anxiety years before the symptoms came up, so why is my suffering being dismissed as nothing? How can I get help, I can't remain dependent on painkillers for the rest of my life if ""it's nothing but some anxiety""."
Heart Attack,"Dizzyness and low pulse rate during nighttime, is this Bradycardia?","I am having periodic sleepless nights due to pronounced dizzyness during my sleep, or when I try to sleep at night. It's very unnerving as I feel like I am going to pass out when I put my head down to rest. Blood pressure for this last episode seems normal (115/68) but pulse sometimes goes pretty low (43 last night for a spell as measured on my FitBit). This has happened two nights this past week. Otherwise, I seem to sleep reasonably well. I am wondering if this relates to drug side effects. I recently had two stents put in my pLAD (April 14, 2018) and it's made a world of difference. No more angina and my energy is back. But these sleeping problems are causing me concern. I am on daily aspirin, Plavix (75mg) and Crestor (10mg). I have lost 13 lbs in the last month as I have moved to a mostly plant-based diet and have cut out all sweets, desserts, fast food, and red meat. And all meats save for the occasional chicken and fish piece. And I don't use salt very much at all.So, with all these medications, weight loss, diet changes, and artery interventions, perhaps my dizzyness might be normal. Or is it? Should I be concerned? Perhaps there is heart damage that I am so far unaware of? If anybody can relate, that would be appreciated. Thanks"
Heart Attack,3 Cardiologists with different opinions. IM TERRIFIED,"Hi, so I've been getting chest flutter-like feelings in my chest since I was about 14 years old. I am 20 years old now and currently attend Tulane University. I went to my doctor in November for a checkup and told her about these chest flutters and she said that she heard a murmur. She decided to give me a echo cardiogram and i was told everything came back normal. About a month going after playing volleyball, I was driving and it felt like my heart was pounding out of my chest all of a sudden. I drove to the ER and they did blood work, EKG, and a chest X-ray and told me everything was normal.I then went to a cardiologists and he told me he may have seen evidence of WPW syndrome on my EKG reading. I then went to get two more opinions and both other cardiologists said they do not see that evidence and one of them placed me on a 30 day event monitor. I press a button when I feel a symptom and I get called from his office if they see anything serious. Ive had the pounding heart rate while on it (which my parents think is anxiety) and I have not gotten a call. I am now on day 29/30 of the event monitor. So far I've gotten 3 chest x-rays, an echo cardiogram last November, blood work, and many EKGs. Could my arteries have been blocked from November to now? I get dizzy throughout the day and get chest flutters daily. Should I be this worried? I am constantly fearing for my life daily.Thanks for reading. "

Heart Attack,Heart Pain,"Hi there, I am an active 21 year old male. I have been suffering from a mild pain in my heart for around 4 months now. It generally occurs 2-3 times a day. After this pain began I decided to see my GP who after listening to my heart believed the pain to be more muscular (from working out). The best way to describe the pain is like a mild fluttering sensation in my chest for 2-3 seconds (sometimes longer). Has anyone else experienced similar symptoms to this? Could it be a muscular problem or something more serious?Cheers Dan"
Heart Attack,Can abnormal ECG report be harmless?,"I had a panic attack like feeling which i thought to be heart attack. I went to the doctor and he told me to do an ECG. The report came abnormal. It read  ""possible preexcitation syndrome"". But the doctor didn't even take this into consideration. He even heard my heart and concluded that its fine. But im not convinced as I'm getting very scary symptoms like chest pain, a discomfort around the left part of my chest and I'm very very lightheaded. I even had a fast heart rate when I was walking. But my rate is under control now as the doctor prescribed me beta blocker. So my question is that can an abnormal ECG report be harmless?"
Heart Attack,Is it possible to request a heart scan privately in the UK? ,"I'm a 28 year old male from the UK. I have an average build and as far as I know there is nothing wrong with my heart other than the fact I suffer from left bundle branch block which was diagnosed in 2015. From the age of 16 up until the age of 26 I was a moderate smoker and I smoked anywhere between five and ten cigarettes a day. I quit more or less straight away when I began to experience pain in my chest after smoking. This was a sharp, stabbing type of pain which, like a pulse, would occur every time my heart contracted. These episodes typically lasted anywhere from a couple of seconds up to half a minute and were very scary.Fortunately for me, no sooner had I quit smoking than the pain departed from me. However there has still been a handful of times in which it has returned, the most recent of which being just under a week ago whilst I was out shopping and lasting for about 20 seconds. This most recent occurrence was particularly uncomfortable and harrowing, to the extent I have been more than a little worried ever since.This is why I have booked an appointment to see my doctor soon as I would like to request some type of scan to check if my arteries are clogged or to determine if there are any other problems which need seeing to. The problem is that I highly doubt the doctor will grant my request for a scan but will more than likely to listen to my heart using his stethoscope, give me a clean bill of health and then send me home. Such an outcome as this will do nothing to help my anxiety so should I be refused a scan I was just wondering if anyone could tell me if there was anywhere else I could go to get a scan privately. Any information would be greatly appreciated.Regards,A worried man"

Heart Attack,Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS),"Has anyone heard of POTS? After a lil over 2 years and 3 Ablations and many trips to the Emergency Room I was diagnosed with POTS. My cardiologist said there is no cure. He put me on new medication to take with other cardiac medication called Digoxin. I have only had 1 does of it so far but I can already say this is gonna be a very long road getting used to this new medication. The nausea is unreal, dizziness, sleeplessness but even with all these symptoms I can say my heart hasn’t been over 120 so Digoxin is doing what it’s supposed to do. I just have to get used to the side effects of a new medication. "

I had no other symptoms during this time, same with when I got up and moved to my bed, and now my resting heart rate is 76-77.  Is this normal, or is there something else going on with my heart that I don't know about.  I should note I've been diagnosed with GAD, have health anxiety and stress at work.

Heart Attack,Please help!!! Im freaking out!!!,"Hello! I'm a 16 year old female who's having odd heart issues. I should first tell you that I was diagnosed with SVT (Supraventricular tachycardia) when I was 13 but just recently had and ablation about 6 months ago. My blood pressure is 134/87 and my pulse rate tends to stay really high. Okay, well about 2 weeks ago I started having an abnormally fast pulse rate and I was short of breath all the time. It lasted for about 4 days before I decided to go to the ER... They did blood work, an electrocardiogram, took an X-ray and monitored me for 6 hours. After those 6 hours were done they told me i was fine and they could find nothing wrong with the tests. Both the doctors and my parents told me it was just stress and anxiety. Its been about 6 days and I still feel like crap but now its weird. My pulse rate isn't bothering me, its now how hard its beating. My head feels crazy (it feels like pressure and I'm dizzy), my chest is tight, I'm still really short of breath, I feel stiff and tight, my left arm keeps having sharp pains at the top (not sure if its related), palpations and I'm having another chest feeling that I can't really describe other than tired and worn out. Its very odd but its been doing this for days now and I can't think of what it could be... None of my limbs are swollen, my blood pressure isn't drastically high and they said I was fine. I'm terrified that something is going to happen in my sleep or my hearts just gonna give out.Can someone please help me!!! I have no idea what's going on and the cardiologist won't see me for another month. I don't want to die"
Heart Attack,I'm scared I have HCM...,"Hello! I'm a 16 year old girl who has had heart problems since I was 12. I was diagnosed with SVT when I was 13, other then that my heart has been completely healthy. I had an ablation 6 months ago and they told me it was a success. About 2 weeks ago I started having some issues. My heart would race when I got up in the morning, I'd have chest tightness all day, every time I get up my heart beats hard enough for me to feel it, I'm getting really bad headaches and dizziness, my chest feels heavy an my heart keeps fluttering and palpitating. I went to the ER 6 days ago and they couldn't find anything on the X rays, blood tests or EKG. But from what I've read you can only know 100% with a echocardiogram which I haven't had in over a year and a half (not counting when they did the abalation). No one in my family has a record of HCM, I have no heart murmur or enlarged heart but I can't think of what else I could have that wouldn't show up on all of those tests. Please help! I'm so scared I have HCM. I don't go in for a echocardiogram for another 4 days but I'm so terrified that something is going to happen before then because of how I feel right now.

Heart Attack,Can someone help me understand my echocardiagram report?,"Hi, I have been suffering from heart palpitations for most of my life. Recently during a very stressful time they got a lot worse and I almost fainted a few times. I had a check up and hey ran a lot of blood tests, which were all normal, then they did an ECG which was abnormal. The report says this:Report: Sinus rhythm ST depression in leads 2, 3 and AVF. Negative wave in lead 3 (approx 1mm).With that they sent me to the cardiologist who did an echo, I have attached the results. They also did an exercise test which was normal. Now the doctor has told me the echo is fine and all things point to it being caused by stress. I happened to get hold of the echo report today though, I know I shouldn't read it when I don't understand but it looks bad to me, some of the things on it sound ominous.... I feel like I have a time bomb in my chest now. Can anyone tell me if I should be worried? In case it's relevant I am 155cm (5'1) 46kg (101lbs) and 26 years old. My BP is 100/60 and resting heart rate is 90. Thanks for any help!  "
Heart Attack,Misdiagnosed ,"So I’m 14 and I’ve been rexperiencing numerous different symptoms in the past few days which include: nausea, shortness of breath, heart racing, aching, tiredness, pains on the sides upper top cage. The doctor checked my temperature, oxygen and pulse rate, heart, throat. He says everything is fine I just feel like it’s not like I’m going to have a heart attack.It mainly happens before bed and then a little throughout the day. My mum is having surgery on Friday so It could be related to that but I don’t know. I’m just worried and scared to go to sleep thinking I’ll have a heart attack in my sleep. "
Heart Attack,Very afraid of dying. Need answers!,"I'm 26 years old, 170lbs (slowly dropping the weight)After I got out of the hospital for my supposed heart attack (was a panic attack based on my labs.) I still felt anxious and worried about my health.  Before that I hadn't been getting a lot of sleep and work was stressing me out.  A few days after my visit to the ER I had a meltdown on Tuesday, though after that I felt better: My left-most chest tension was all but gone and my anxiety was gone too.  I felt better until I got a look at my fingernails, which looked red but were just a slightly deep pink, and looked up the reasons why they happened. The one thing that kept coming up was heart trouble, and as a result I felt anxious, dizzy and weak until Friday, with my chest tension and left arm aches.  On Friday I had my follow-up appointment with a doctor, which went over fine and I left for work right after.  I was fine at work until I got nervous and worried over my heart health again, but by evening I felt better.  At 11pm I had a sudden, sharp left arm pain that stretched from my forearm to my pinky finger that lasted for a few hours and didn't change intensity (about a 4-5 on the pain scale) The next morning I woke up anxious, dizzy and shaky, but otherwise I was ok. I took Lexapro for the first time that morning, too.  By mid afternoon I could feel the effects, but it was almost as if my anxiety symptoms were enhanced, even if I felt mellow and emotionless.  Once I got home I experienced tense abdominal muscles, leg and arm stiffness and tingling in both my pinky and ring fingers on both hands, plus I felt dizzy and weak.  On sunday I woke up feeling a bit anxious and weak, still sporting left chest tension and arm aches, and after I got up and walking the symptoms got better for me, to the point of going away completely by evening.  I was feeling good until I checked my heart rate, which was in the mid 60's when sitting down and in the 70's and 80's when standing or walking. It was 59 when laying down in bed, as well. Now I'm stressed/anxious about my health AGAIN, even though my heart rate being that low is normal. The symptoms I had throughout all of this DID NOT change in intensity or get worse, and I've been going through digestive detox for the past week so idk if that has any bearing on my overall health.  I'm afraid to talk about this with my parents  (who think I'm going crazy worrying about my health)  and I don't want to make another trip to the doctor only to find that everything is fine.  My labs during my stay in the hospital showed that I had not experienced a heart attack, my bloodwork came back good (they did a D-Dimer, too, which was 450/500) and two EKG's showed a normal heart rhythm.  Idk what to do.....I'm afraid to fall asleep at night now and I fear this is ruining my life. "

Heart Attack,Heart attack or panic disorder?,"Hi. I am 21 years old and have had panic disorder since 18 and consider myself a hypochondriac (health anxiety). Pretty much every day between those years I have had anxiety about my health(constant chest pains, ice pick headaches, left arm pain) pretty much tricking myself into feeling life threatening sensations. I have been to the ER multiple times for thinking I am experiencing a heart attack. So many EKG’s, blood tests, x rays and everything comes back normal, only thing that is abnormal during the tests is high blood pressure Due to the hyperventilating and stress levels but soon resides after they tell me everything is ok. I use to take Xanax but they took me off of it cuz of its addictive qualities. They put me on Prozac and I had a bad reaction to it. Since then I have been taking no medications. I had it under control for the most part until recently. For about two weeks now all I’ve been thinking about is dying from a heart attack. Because of this I’ve had come and go chest pains, but this morning I almost had another ER episode. While driving to work at about 5:30 this morning, my chest started to tighten with sharp pains. But this one was different then the others. I got a sharp radiating almost irritating pain in my throat and jaw and along with the chest pain that is a sign of a heart attack. I started freaking out while telling myself it was just a panic attack but something was telling me it wasnt(then again idk if this is my anxiety or not) but this lasted for about 10 mins. After I felt very neasuas and very tired with residual chest pains and short breathing. The day has pretty much passed and now the chest and jaw pains comes and go but not as severe. Should I be worried? Could it be angina? Someone help I’m tired of feeling like this and tired of feeling like the only one. Could it be heartburn? I do burp a lot when I feel chest pains. "

Heart Attack,"It has been 2 weeks now I have had a fast heart rate,and a bit of chest discomfort","It all started with a night when i was about to go to bed, suddenly I felt like I was fainting. My heart rate accelerated to almost 200bpm. My head felt light and a bit of discomfort in the chest. I thought I had a heart attack. It lasted for 3 hours. I was okay when I woke up the next morning. After then I had a chest tightness that stayed for 3-4 days and I was diagnosed with tachycardia. The lightheadedness is still there and i feel the chest discomfort is not going.heart rate is still a bit high. I am scared of going out because I think I will die any time. When I'm waking up its alright but as it gets night, I feel weak everyday and the lightheadedness doesn't go. I am a 17yr old male. Is there an underlying heart condition behind this?really need help I can't just keep thinking of this, and when im thinking about this, it gets worse."

Heart Attack,Heart attack symptoms for two months. ,"To start off, I'm 19. I have severe anxiety and panic disorder. I also have hypertension, but recently my np has stabilized to normal numbers. Since October 20th, I have had a pain in my chest. It can be either a sharp pain in my left chest, a burning sensation in my whole chest or a slight discomfort. I also get an issue where it feels as though there is something blocking my throats when I try to take a deep breath. Lastly, I have a sharp pain in my left bicep when the sharp pain in my chest is happening. When this first started, I rushed to the ER. They did an x-ray, ekg, blood test and a urine test. Everything came back normal. They told me to follow up with my gp, and I did a week later. She just sat there nodding my head when I listed off my symptoms and acted like she wasn't listening. She told me it was probably(PROBABLY) my acid reflux moxed with my anxiety. So she prescribed me omeprazole and hydroxyzine. The hydroxyzine helps my anxiety, but the omeprazole doesn't even ease my acid reflux symptoms.  Anyway, she also told me she scheduled an echocardiogram for me two days later. I had that done and got my results a few days later. She told me everything looked fine but that I showed signs that my heart had slightly enlarged. That's the last time I've seen a doctor, and that was about two weeks before thanksgiving. Since, my symptoms have stayed the same and I'm still having daily panic attacks. The symptoms seem to ease slightly when I wake up, but get worse throughout the day. They also seems to get worse when I stand, and ease slightly when I sit/relax. Another thing that kind of helps is belching/passing gas. I'm really just tired of fearing for my life every day. Does this sound like anything specific? I may have left out a few things as this was a long wall of text to write.

Heart Attack,19 years old with chest pain and ectopic beats ,"So just under 4 years ago I was sat playing on my Xbox when I experienced my first ever chest pain. Obviously I felt nothing of it. I visited the doctors who told me first it was stress or a torn muscle. I then went back after a couple months because I was still getting these pains, I was sent to the hospital to have an ECG done to give me peace of mind In which it came back and my doctor said there was a slight LVH. She said it would go and there was nothing to worry about. I eventually returned to the doctors and I was sent to see a cardiologist who did an ECG on me there at the hospital and I had a chest x-ray. Nothing was found. All normal. Last year I started to get this funny feeling, which felt like a palpitation (I know now that it was ectopic beats)  I went back the doctors again and this time I saw a different doctor, I had a 2 week ECG fitted on. When the results came back for that she said there was some SVT on the ECG as well as ectopic beats. I was then referred me to a different cardiologist. I had another ECG done, I had an ultra sound of the heart and I had a urine test. Everything came back fine and they weren’t worried but they saw that I was getting ectopic beats. I told them I was getting them daily and I still am to this point of which you’re reading. I have also told them that a few times when I have laid down or jumped on my bed something triggered my heart and it started to rapidly beat. They blame it all on anxiety and stress and saying there was too much pressure on my chest when I breath in. Yes my diet isn’t really good atm. Takeaways nearly every day but I am 5”8. 9 stone 4 so it’s not as if I’m fat. Also recently I have been experiencing pressure on my chest when I lay down, for this I have to take deep breaths. I don’t know if this is all in my head or if I should go back! It’s really frustrating especially when I just want to get on with a normal life  "

Heart Attack,Chest pain after running,"Hi , I’m writing on behalf of my 17 year old brother , he says that he is feeling some sort of chest pain which is often triggered after doing some sort of cardio , and also he says he kind of feels like he gets a tiny bit of shortness of breath .When he lies down for a little bit it will go away.I’ll be brutally honest me and him have both done a lot of drugs and he has smoked a lot of cannabis which has been mixed with tobacco , so the possibility of a collapsed lung is alsways there. We have done a lot of illegal substances together ,this is no longer the people we are we learnt from our mistakes and now don’t do any sort of drugs : however we are both very young and it can all be reversed by good solid nutrition and the fact our body’s are always repairing . Any ideas what this could be ? It’s been happening for a few months , and comes and goes , cardio can be the trigger"
Heart Attack,SVT at 240bpm.. Worried it will kill me if it happens again,"Hi,I am 20 years old and two years ago had my first episode of SVT however the paramedics could never capture it on an ECG as it had always gone back to normal when they arrived. The otherday I had another episode (the first in two years!) where my heart started racing for about 5 minutes. I have been fitted with a loop recorder that records my heart rhythm in order to capture one of these episodes. Finally the device has capture one and the doctor said it was between 220bpm and 240bpm.I now feel quite crippled with anxiety as I am petrified this will happen again and kill me due to the speed at which my heart is going. How long can your heart beat and that speed. Also I have had atrial fib when having a electrophysiology study which the cardiologist suggested was probably induced artificially. I know when combined SVT and AF can be life threatening so this makes me even more worried.Thanks in advance! "

Heart Attack,36 year old widowmaker survivor,"My wife whom is 36 years old. Three months ago survived a widowmaker. She had a stent placed with an 80% blockage. Last week she went to the hospital because she lost a pint of blood in less than 12 hours. She was i. The hospital for 3 hours and was told if her chest hurts again she dosnt need to come to the hospital each time. Her cardiologist is an absolute idiot. So she was at work today and was complaining that her chest hurts so bad and arm numb from shoulder to elbow. She isnt one to complain and like when she had the widowmaker the doctor praised me for bringing her. He said she would have certainly died that night in her sleep. Its been hurting her last couple days since and while in the hospital. Should I take her to a diff hospital? Should I blow it off and see if it gets worse? Or call 911? It is getting worse. She is nasuase, chest pain all the way through back, numb in shoulder to elbow... Also when she had the widowmaker she had perfect ekg. They foudn it in her bloodwork. Please help asap and thanks ahead."
Heart Attack,Fit Bit,"Hi all, have posted before about palps, raised and pounding heart beat and chest pain.  After various tests and visits to cardiologist I sort of accept that mine is food related as it always happens after a main meal, this has never been caught on any of the tapes or tests I have had unfortunately. I also have GERD or GORD as my GP in UK always reminds me! My husband brought us both fitbits, which for someone with heart obsessions is probably a good idea but I think he hoped it would put my mind at rest, which is has done since starting using it about 2 weeks ago. My resting is 61 which at 59 I am pleased with, it sometimes goes as low as mid 50's when just sitting which does worry me slightly, and obviously lower in bed at night.  Now my question on Saturday we went to London and had a meal and a couple of drinks, I had deep fried shrimp, fries, coleslaw and a couple of ciders, after this my heart went nuts it was 120 and never, even when sitting and resting went under 79 this carried on until last night (Sunday) and now is back to normal, 63 whilst typing.  This is what I have tried to get the cardio to see happening, I know it is the food but why does it take 24 hours to settle down, how do I explain this to the Cardio as it is not that clear on the graph and to be honest not sure they would take must notice anyway.  Does this fit with anyone else experiences, I wondered whether I had an allergy to certain foods etc.Hi all, have posted before about palps, raised and pounding heart beat and chest pain.  After various tests and visits to cardiologist I sort of accept that mine is food related as it always happens after a main meal, this has never been caught on any of the tapes or tests I have had unfortunately.

Heart Attack,Pinching on left side of chest. ,"Let me start by saying that I am 23 years old, 5'2 and weigh 100lbs. I am slightly underweight and really out of shape, I don't work out at all. I suffer from panic and anxiety and depression. With that being said, I've been having this horrible pinching on the left side of my chest. It will be really bad for about 5 mins, w a pinch every like 30 seconds, then go off and come back in half hour or sooner or later. This started yesterday around 3pm then was off until later that night maybe 1am. That's when it got really bad so I went to sleep to avoid this horrible feeling. Today it's been off and on all day long. I'm really scared that this may be something life threatening. I've had an EKG, echo, holter for 24 hrs, chesst xray about 3 months ago when my anxiety was really bad and all was normal. I failed to complete the stress test however bc I started to panic and felt out of breathe. As far as other symptoms, I do feel a bit out of it sometimes when I get the pinching, this can be due to me panicking over it though. Thoughts? Should I go back to the doctors? "
Heart Attack,Why is Exercise Making Me Sick?,"Since my full story is very long, I am going to break it down to save you some time. You may ask questions if you need more details to make educated guesses or suggestions.Brief story:I'm a man in my early 30's and I have been sick on and off for about 12 years, extremely so the last 8 months. I am pretty fit as I have been exercising regularly and eating extremely healthy for as long as I can remember. I have done probably all tests doctors would ever recommend without finding anything special.After being very ill for the last few months, I haven't been doing any exercise. The last month I was actually starting to feel real good again. I started working out in the gym and after just 2 weeks, I crashed. After everything I've tried changing in my life, I would never have guessed that exercise was the culprit that made me sick.Here's the list of my todays main symptoms:- Extreme mental and physical fatigue/lethargy for days/weeks/months.- Having the need to take naps during the day despite of having long good sleep.- Massive brainfog and cognitive impairment- Very sore muscles (especially legs) 2-3 days after working out.- Shortness of breath- Constant Bradycardia (47-55 beats/minute).- Occasional arrythmia (quick beats followed by pause).- Stiff muscles and joints in the morning.- Constant stiff and painful neck.- Low libido for weeks.- Occasional blurry vision, especially in the evening (washing eyes won't help).Here most of the tests I have done that all showed normal with few minor exceptions:- MSLT- CBC- Electrolytes- Testosterone (total/free)- Albumin- Estrogen- Ferritin/iron- Cortisol (blood): showed elevated- Cortisol (24h urine): showed normal- ECG (showed bradycardia)- Thyroid (TSH, T3, T4)- Blood Culture- ANA Immunoflourescent- All diabetes tests- C-reactive protein- Spirometry and anti-astma medicine- Lung and heart x-ray- Yeah, even brain CT...My latest doctor recommended me to try the Stress Test and I am waiting to be scheduled for this.Questions:1) What diseases can make you sick long term when you exercse, even as little as 3h/week?2) Are there any other tests left that you would suggest me ticking off?3) Other thoughts/suggestions?I am of course willing to give up exercise to live a normal life, but it would truly blow to not be able to keep the weight, and I also tend to get very stiff without exercise.I am extremely thankful for any help I can get. I know time is valuable and I therefore consider those helping out on forums true heroes. I am even willing to donate money somewhere if I could be pointed in the right direction and figure it out. I plan to do a lot of charity in the future and help others who are trying to find their ""health culprit"".Thank you for listening."
Heart Attack,"Cardiologist found a heart murmur, I'm terrified. ","Hi everyone,I'll try and cut a long story short here. Only, I am really scared at the moment, and after doing quite a bit of research over the last week, I am convinced I am suffering from aortic regurgitation. So, all my life (I'm 25, 26 in June) I have had a strange relationship with my heartbeat. I hate the feel of it. I remember when I was around 10/11, being obsessed with thinking that I could make my heart skip a beat through my breathing. Only it used to scare me as I thought that as I breathed in and my heart delayed its beat, it actually wouldn't beat again. I became really conscious of my breathing and I've always felt I've had to consciously breath a lot more than normal. This has stayed with me all my life. Plainly, over the years its made me really anxious, particularly when exercising. The thing is, I have always been able to feel my heartbeat. I'm quite a skinny guy with a small frame and assumed this is relatively normal. As I've gotten older, however, I realise that it perhaps is not entirely normal. I can see my pulse in my left rib, as well as in my neck. Sometimes I can see it very faintly in my right wrist. A few years ago I started getting strange beats. Not racing or anything, but the beats themselves felt 'floppy' and spasm like. It would happen randomly seemingly with no correlation to anything I'd been doing. Lately these beats had gotten worse so I went to a doctor. He suggested they were harmless but said for piece of mind he would refer me to a consultant cardiologist for a chat. So last week I went to my local hospital and had a chat with a consultant cardiologist. They ran an ECG on me, which apparently all looked fine, and after describing the beats, she basically told me not to worry. I also described the power of my pulse unnerves me and I asked if it was normal. Again, she said it was fine. Then before I went, she had a listen to my chest through a stethoscope. She was very thorough. All sorts of positions and had my leaning forward and holding my breathe etc. She prodded my stomach a few times (not sure why?) and checked my legs for swelling (I understand to check for edema?). After she said she could hear a small murmur. However, she stressed to me more than once that, to her, it sounded innocent and I really should not worry at all. However, then she started writing out a referral to have an echo scan! Next, she is talking about how valves in your heart can leak...My understanding is that heart valve leakage (regurgitation) is not something I shouldn't worry about. How could she actually tell if the murmur was innocent just by hearing it? Can she do that, really?Since, I've done some research and I'm convinced I have aortic regurgitation. 1. I have a pounding pulse. I can visible see my head slightly bobbing with each heartbeat. I can see my heartbeat in my left rib and in my neck. I also have a collapsing pulse when I raise my arm above my head. 2. There is obviously a murmur and she was talking about leakage.. her attitude to me seem to change completely after she examined me. 3. I've noticed myself getting out a breath a bit more easy in short and intense spurts of exercise. 4. Lying on my left side at night is becoming unbearable. Usually in a morning on waking up my heart rate is usually mid 40s (when I'm not stressed etc). I'm in decent shape. Sitting here typing this, I am a little anxious, but not overly and my heart rate is at 62. This morning the pounding, not racing, of my heart was driving me crazy. Against how I felt, I decided to go for a walk. I walked at a brisk pace for around 4 miles. When I was out walking I noticed the pounding had died down a lot and could barely feel my heart in my chest just standing still. The pulse was quicker, but I could barely feel it. This seems weird to me? I did read that aortic regurgitation accommodates a higher pulse rates well as there is less time for regurgitation?Was my cardiologist just trying to not scare me or should I really be worried? I've done nothing but research this constantly now for over a week. Thanks in advance.Paul "
Heart Attack,Newly diagnosed with AF,"Hello,Early last month I had pneumonia and during my time in hospital I was diagnosed with AF.I had never heard of it before and I was very shocked.    The doctor said I may have had it for years but not known.   I have to say that for years I have often been breathless and get tired easily.    The doctor put me on apixaban and I hate the thought of taking tablets for the rest of my life.   I am 73,  I am a healthy weight, I exercise daily and before contracting pneumonia I have rarely been ill.    I had a follow up appointment with the doctor a couple of weeks ago and I am told my  pulse is rapid thought my blood pressure is a bit low.    I have now been given bisoloprolol and I am told that my pulse though still irregular is lower.   Only now am I reading that people have episodes of AF but I am not sure what that means and I think my AF is probably constant if that makes sense.    I am trying to learn to live with all this,  I am not sure whether or not I am glad I found out there was a problem.   I suppose at least now I am on tablets it helps avoid a stroke,  such a terrifying thought.   I often feel so exhausted, especially in the evenings and it takes me ages to climb upstairs now.   I don`t know whether this is because I had pneumonia, or because of either of the tablets I take.   It can`t be because of AF because surely that didn`t start suddenly when I was in hospital.    I wonder if I could not take the bisoloprolol as I think that makes you tired.Not sure what to think.I have an appointment with the cardiologist early in June but I feel the doctors don`t have time to answer all our questions.    I sometimes wonder if I have AF because of something I did.   Is it my fault?    Sorry for the long post.   I would appreciate anyone`s comments or advice.   Thanks.Kathleen"
Heart Attack,Regurgitation of mitral valve,7 years ago I had to have knee surgery after a car accident that was not my fault. I ended up in hospital with a blood infection called MSSA which damaged my mitral valve. I have had yearly heart scans since then. This time the cardiologist was different and asked me how I was feeling. I told him I was sleeping a lot and I needed to sleep during the day. He decided to take a blood test that shows how much strain the heart chamber where the regurgitation is. I have not got the results of this yet. However he has booked me in to have an excersise tolorence test. After 7 years of no problems I think the time has come where they are going to have to give me surgery. This absolutely terrifies me. Does anyone know how far they will let this go before actually giving me the surgery?Thank you in advance

Heart Attack,"Had a new/ different onset/trigger of symptoms, any idea what this sounds like?","So I've posted on here a few times before and it's been helpful so I'm trying again. I will start with background.Im 30 years old and male 170 lbs and i have no known health issues other than my cardiologist diagnosed me with PVCs and PACs. I have been monitorer by my cardiologist for the past 2 years, have done a month long and two 48 hour heart monitors and event monitors. Stress test and heart ultrasound have been done as well. All with normal results aside from what the cardiologist said where PVC and PACs.So what happens to me ( and this all just started about 3 years ago out  of the blue) is that upon exercising or physical exertion i will have these attacks of racing heart, weakness, blurred vision, sense of impending doom, anxiety, and tingling of the extremities. They typically last 5-30 minutes. Also consumption of caffeine will now bring the attacks on as well. My dr placed me on beta blocker propranolol as needed and once daily calcium channel blocker diltiazem (cartia xt). I have never had issues through high school sports or college sports, even after college no issues until i was around 27 years of age.So my question is about a new trigger of symptoms. I currently am on amoxicillin twice a day for 10 days due to strep throat infection. So today I woke  up and took my amoxicillin, and was in the kitchen getting some breakfast ready when i coughed really hard due to my strep throat and i could feel alot of the congested stuff in my chest move up due to the cough, and with this cough it threw me into an attack immediately. I went tachycardic ( i counted about 130 bpm while sitting, and my normal baseline is 55-60 resting). I felt the weakness and the doom and the vision changes. It was a shorter lived attack and less severe than some, but I've never had one start due to a cough. The cough very obviously threw me into the attack and then while sitting down after about 3 minutes i could feel my heart immediately return to normal rhythm.Does anyone know what this could be or why this may have occurred? (SVT...some other arrhythmia?)Thanks "
Heart Attack,"SVT, Sinus arrhythmia Heart Ablation ",I have had 3 heart Ablations 2 of which was this month. I have heart rates as high as 168 and now I can feel my heart skipping beats. My doctor wants to do a 4th Ablation and I don’t understand why they don’t just put a pacemaker in. I have as many as 200 episodes in about 2 1/2 weeks since last Ablation. I’m weak all the time and just plain tired of it all now. I’m 44 and feel like I’m 94. 
Heart Attack,Is it possible for a woman with a ToF to have some childrens? ,Actually i already had my tetrallogy of fallot a total corrected surgeon in 2002. But still  i fell anxious with this.. i want to have 4 or maybe 5 childrens.. is it possible? will my heart make it? should it be normal delivery or caesarean? Thank you.
Heart Attack,Heart problems at 17 and doctors don't know what's wrong!?,"I'm a 17-year-old female who follows a vegan diet and exercises about 6 times a week. I drink about 2-3 litres of water a day and eat the most out of everyone in my family (however I am mindful of what I eat). Because I am active, my resting heart rate usually sits between 60 - 70 bpm.On Tuesday of last week, I had a panic attack (my first and only one) because of stress I'd been under the previous week. After that, my heart rate stayed elevated all afternoon and late into the evening. The next day my heart rate was elevated again and I could feel a burning/aching sensation in my chest. My heart rate was 87bpm in my first class, then 91bpm in my second where I began sweating and experienced shortness of breath.On Thursday, my heart rate got so high in my 4th-period class that I became short of breath and began to sweat quite badly. I was experiencing such discomfort that I got up to go the bathroom twice, being unable to sit still. It was horrendous and I ended up texting my mum to come get me. That night, after the heart rate remaining high for about 2-3 hours, I was taking to see my GP. An ECG was conducted, however, nothing irregular showed. My pulse was at 95bpm to 97bpm and my blood pressure was elevated. I was sent away to get blood tests taken.On Friday my nose started bleeding in class while I was sitting completely still and feeling no emotional distress at all. The same elevated heart rate and shortness of breath occurred during the next period and I was sent home.During the weekend I developed back pain and chest pain, especially when lying down, and started finding it hard to get comfortable at night when I was relaxing in bed. The pain even extended across my shoulder blades and up the back of my neck a few times. On Monday, I lost my appetite. Unusual for me because I have a rather large appetite and never even lose it when I'm nervous or stressed. I'm more of an emotional eater. On Tuesday, I visited my GP again who gave me iron tablets and ascorbic acid tablets for an iron deficiency detected in my blood. He told me that it was very unlikely that an iron deficiency had caused my heart to act this way because (according to older blood tests I never got results for) I had always had low iron levels. I had a chest x-ray done, then I was sent away to do more blood tests. Both of these came back normal.On Wednesday, I began experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath in class, then when I stood I got pain all through the back and sides of my head. I was very lightheaded and thought I was going to faint. My parents picked me up and I was taken to the hospital, but after 4 hours of talking to nurses and doctors and waiting, I was sent away with no answers provided. My pulse was at 107bpm and my blood pressure was once again elevated. The blood tests they did came back normal and so did the ECG. They were saying it could be something along the lines of stress or anxiety, but really they didn't know what was wrong.I've been having bad headaches and lightheadedness since. The symptoms are still persisting.I've been booked in to see a cardiologist, but that could take anywhere up to 6 weeks before I get in.Just a note that despite me never experiencing anything like this, there are heart conditions on my mum's side. My grandma has angina. My grandpa had a triple heart bypass. My mum and her brother have an irregular pulse. My aunt has a tear in her heart.Has anyone experienced this or knows what could possibly be a cause?"
Heart Attack,"Heart fluttering (palpitations), tight chest, fast heart rate, etc. What could it be?","So a few weeks ago I was in class at college and I noticed my breathing was a little off. I seemed to be easily exerted and I kind of had to force myself to take full breaths. when I was driving home it seemed to be getting a little worse so eventually I went to the ER but they said my lungs were fine, my EKG was fine, they couldn't find anything abnormal other than that, for my age, my blood pressure was a little high (157/90 at the highest, I believe) but they said that could be due to nervousness of a medical setting. A few days later I found myself back in the ER for the same reason, but it had gotten a little worse. I was trying to be a hypochondriac but I've just always heard that trouble breathing and chest pain/tightness should always be seen.Again: EKGs, blood work, ultrasounds, MRIs, and still nothing. I think they chalked it up to my acid reflux and/or indigestion although I had no other usual symptoms of that.I finally went to see my PCP and they did the usual tests too. Other than a bit of a fast heart rate and, once again, slightly elevated blood pressure, everything else seemed fine (lung sounds, EKG). She even gave me an anxiety test but I only scored a 3 on the scale which led her to believe that's not what this is (I also don't believe I have anxiety, apart from a couple scattered ""panic attacks"" over the past year or so).I have always gotten heart palpations where my heart feels like it literally skips a beat, but haven't really had any other issues so I never thought anything of it. All of this leads me to where I am today and why I'm posting this.I am having constant fluttering in my heart at the moment and have been for a couple of hours now. I can breathe IN fine, but breathing out when I'm talking seems to be forced (as in, when I'm talking, I run out of breath and exhaling feels labored). I even had a flutter so intense that I jumped a little. I'm not really experiencing any ""pain"" other than it sort of feels like someone is poking my chest ever-so-lightly with their finger (it's dull, not sharp). If this were a heart issue, wouldn't it have shown up on the several EKGs I've gotten recently?I'm posting on here for other ideas/opinions and I would really rather not end up going to the ER again because it's not much of an emergency but I thought I'd see what others had to say! Also I didn't know what forum to put this in. I'm new here."
Heart Attack,Tramadol and heart problems,"I have been taking tramadol and Tradol retard for about 17 years, and until recently regarded it as a very safe medication. Two weeks ago I sufferred a heart attack, with an underlying problem of a blocked  artery. I assumed it had nothing to do with the medicine until I began investigating, and found that many people had actually died because it increased the chances of an attack. Has anybody got more information about this, or heard of similar cases? Many thanks. Michael E."
Heart Attack,Positive test result and I'm terrified! Has anyone here failed the tilt table test testing positive?,"'ve been undergoing all sorts of testing since January 13 to find out why I am so dizzy/lightheaded. GP has sent me to three specialists at the same time, a Nero-otologist, cardiologist, and a Gastrow intestinal doctor as he was not sure where the dizziness was coming from. With Nero I have a VNG and ECOG test next Wednesday the 8th and I have an endoscopy scheduled with Gastro on the 17th... But yesterday with the cardiologist I had a tilt table test... And I tested positive! I am terrified! My follow-up appointment with cardiology isn't until the 15th, after the test at the hospital they told me I was positive because my blood pressure and my heart rate dropped dramatically when they gave me nitroglycerin at 70° tilt... I Did not pass out... I have never passed out... but I've never felt so ill in my life I thought I would die! I see posted all over here that people have been through cardiology testing to rule out that as a cause, so has anyone of you failed the tilt table test or gotten a positive result from it? I did fine the first part of the test where they do it without any medicine ... was not dizzy or lightheaded at all... But the second part of the test where they give you the nitroglycerin certainly had a very bad effect on me... Now I do not know if I should keep my appointment the 8th with the Nuero... But my ears are still ringing and full so I still feel that is where my dizziness is coming from... But with this positive test on the tilt table I am just terrified..."

Thankfully my anxiety has been at bay and I have managed to live my life a little, I even got pregnant and was on cloud nine!

When he took my heart rate it was at 137BPM and off he sent me to A&E. My heart rate remained in the 130 range through out the day even when I felt like I was most relaxed it was high. Unfortunately I had a miscarriage yesterday and was rushed to hospital with pains. Today they took my heart rate and it was 115, but would not budge whatsoever. The nurses wouldn't let me leave but after looking at my blood results they agreed to. Is this normal? Should I be worried?

Heart Attack,Palpitations- should I get this checked out??,"Hey guys. So I’ve had palpitations once in a blue moon since I was little. Yearly checkups went smoothly and having these once in awhile is normal. For the last month and a half, possibly 2 months, I’ve been having palpitations at least x1/week. They’re short, only a few seconds, they start suddenly and go suddenly. They’re just an annoyance, and I figured I should get my heart checked out from that based on the frequency. It didn’t bother me much though. Last night I had a palpitation unlike anything I experienced in terms of duration. I was lying down when it started, so I sat back up thinking it would fix it- it didn’t. It went on for what felt like forever (I’m gonna say 10 seconds). It freaked me out to the point where I was trying to think of what to do- should I call 911, my parents, etc. since I was babysitting at the time. The beat for all my palpitations is irregular, it feels like someone is shaking my heart up or put it in a blender honestly. I got a little lightheaded from that one, but no blackouts. I did have to keep massaging my chest because I felt tiny palpitations after that and some pressure/unease for the next half hour. I’m 21, my grandmother died of some heart failure around her early 50s. I’m still thinking nothing is wrong with me but the last palpitations had me tearing up from fear. I’m very sure this isn’t from stress, I don’t drink caffeine, don’t take drugs, any of those culprits it’s a no. I don’t get it. Should I go see a dr? Does it sound like I need to be checked out?Thanks <3Hey guys. So I’ve had palpitations once in a blue moon since I was little.

They’re short, only a few seconds, they start suddenly and go suddenly. They’re just an annoyance, and I figured I should get my heart checked out from that based on the frequency. It didn’t bother me much though. Last night I had a palpitation unlike anything I experienced in terms of duration. I was lying down when it started, so I sat back up thinking it would fix it- it didn’t. It went on for what felt like forever (I’m gonna say 10 seconds). It freaked me out to the point where I was trying to think of what to do- should I call 911, my parents, etc. since I was babysitting at the time. The beat for all my palpitations is irregular, it feels like someone is shaking my heart up or put it in a blender honestly. I got a little lightheaded from that one, but no blackouts. I did have to keep massaging my chest because I felt tiny palpitations after that and some pressure/unease for the next half hour. I’m 21, my grandmother died of some heart failure around her early 50s. I’m still thinking nothing is wrong with me but the last palpitations had me tearing up from fear. I’m very sure this isn’t from stress, I don’t drink caffeine, don’t take drugs, any of those culprits it’s a no. I don’t get it. Should I go see a dr? Does it sound like I need to be checked out?Thanks <3"
Heart Attack,Health Issues and Concerns,"I am a 52 year old male that has some concerns for my health. I have recently had Anxiety / Panic Issues really bad. It got so bad I had to leave work, because I was dizzy and felt like I was having a heart attack, it would come and go. One day it got so bad that I had a friend take me to a very well known ER and had one of the Doctor's look at me. My BP was high at  the time and they took Blood, did a MRI to make sure I didnt have a heart attack, they did a ekg and took blood. All the results came back and they didn't see any issues. The ER doctor referred me to a Heart Specialist and when I went for my appointment they did check my BP again and scheduled me for a Stress Test. I had to stand on a treadmill to get my heart racing. and had all these wires connected to me. About a day or so later the heart specialist called me and said my results came back fine and clear with no heart issues and that I am ok.I decided to get a primary doctor for myself and I went into the office and told him what was going on. when I had my BP taken I was 180 /96. He ordered a scan right away, after a hour or so he came back and said the result looked fine with no issues but I did have High Blood Pressure. he put me on 10mg of lisinopril. Once I started taking it i noticed my BP to lower through out the day. I am here babbling on, my issue I am having is that I feel a discomfort in my left side chest area at time to time. almost like a pinching feeling. could this be my anxiety / panic doing it? I am looking for serious answere's please. Hoping from a doctor. I just checked my bp now and it was 113 / 84 is this too low for a 52 year old male?"
Heart Attack,Concerned ,"I’m 60 and have been having various symptoms that “appear” heart related. Pain in the middle of my chest radiating up to my right jaw, severe fatigue, shortness of breath for no reason. I’m waiting for an angiogram, no obvious problems with EKG, etc.  The stress test was inconclusive. My question is I’ve been to the ER 3 times with obvious symptoms but EKGS are fine and blood enzymes are ok. Same comments of possible “panic attack”. I’ve had one panic attack 15 years ago and this is nothing like it. Does anyone else have negative tests?"
Heart Attack,Undiagnosed issues with my heart? ,"I have this fluttery feeling in my chest that I don't know why, won't go away. I went to the ER two weeks ago and it's been fine until now. They took my blood. I'm not deficient in anything, my heart enzymes are fine they said, my blood pressure was a little higher I guess but they didn't say it was. After salene I felt fine, I don't know why. But my heart rate seems to range from 50-60, and I workout frequently. It only came back a few days after one cup of coffee, and I snacked a lot the day before as well. I can't tell if it's in my head or not. I know going to the ER or urgent care is pointless as everything will come back fine and that will be it. I'm out of answers.

Heart Attack,Weird spasms in chest,"Hey there,For the sake of transparency: Last week, I was supposed to get on a flight to France. I had a panic attack and opted not to fly that day. My anxiety has been on edge for the past few days as I'm scheduled to fly on Tuesday.Two nights ago I started having these weird spasms in my chest. It feels like there's a small ""shockwave"" that goes through my body when I have them some times, other times it just feels like a ""twitch"" inside of my chest. I also have pain in my chest, but it appears to be fairly localized as if I can ""touch"" it externally. I believe the chest/back/neck pain that I have is likely unrelated and a result of my mattress/pillows.I went to the ER last night and they put me on an EKG machine that was barely functional -- It kept thinking that I was flat lining when I was obviously still awake. Eventually, they used a portable EKG machine that only captures a 10 second snapshot of my heart -- During that time, I did not experience any of these symptoms. However, I did while the RN and Doctor were listening to my chest and they couldn't hear anything weird while I was experiencing these symptoms. I've been exhausted lately, I've had severe heartburn while trying to sleep at times. Some foods sit like a rock in my stomach as if the food cannot be digested. This primarily happens with things such as bread, pasta, etc... I was diagnosed with IBS as a child, and have had intermittent issues with lactose intolerance since. Last year I had a blood test done where my glucose levels were a bit elevated, my creatinine levels were elevated, and my liver function was slightly decreased. Since then, I've had normal blood tests. Everything else was within normal range.When I went to the ER, I told them about my anxiety levels -- They completely dismissed anything I had to say after I mentioned anxiety. I'm well aware that this could be anxiety -- but I don't think it is. I think there's something else that's causing my anxiety to get worse, and my anxiety is amplifying my symptoms. No one has been willing to do more than look into a basic CBC/Chem7 or an EKG that lasts all of 10 seconds. Over the past two days, I cut out caffeine and nicotine to see what happens -- There was no noticeable change. Does anyone have any ideas/suggestions?"
Heart Attack,"Strange heart issues, doctors stumpted, Anyone any similar experience?","So I was initially being treated for severe anaemia, which was ruled the cause of my dizzyness shortness of breath and occasional chest pain.It's under control now and my symptoms have got worse, I'm on ibuprofen 3 times a day to manage the heart pain. Xrays and ecgs are normal, 24 hour one upcoming. The doctors seem to think there's some kind of issue with my heart since my blood pressure and heartbeat can be irregular (blood pressure can drop suddenly, heartbeat resting is between 80-90 which isn't too good for an 18 year old).Anyone any experience with anything like this, know how to manage my symptoms or anything? It's destroying my social life since there's a risk I could black out or lose the ability to stand at any point, and have done on multiple occasions."
Heart Attack,"heart problems,  tight neck, please help what should i do :(","hi, can someone give me a bit of advice on my heart. A couple months ago i recently starting geting a tight pain down the left side of my neck and it would feel weird when i squeeze it as if a nerve was tensing in my neck and it was going right up past my ear and the pain would occasionaly spread to my arm.

Heart Attack,"Rapid heartbeat, headaches, dizziness, neck feels like its swollen, but isnt","I'm a 21 year old girl... I've been experiencing symptoms that kind of...does not appear in any kind of tests. My heart beat is really fast. Almost every time whenever I'm sitting and I check, its over 100 but it slows down if I do a breathing exercises. But as I stop it, it continues to get over 100.they took like, 4 ecgs, and a heart monitor device attached for 24 hours, and found nothing . with the fast heart rate, I've been feeling pain in my chest area and arms and shoulder. But, that pain doesn't seem like its too deep, it feels under skin and more like over bones.Whenever I stand up, I get dizzy and my neck feels like its swollen but it actually isnt and it feels heavy too.These days, I've had a sour throat, or could it be just some infection in my throat... It feels like my neck is swelling and it feels the same in ear and the end of my head too.  It got worse after the sour throat, bit i jad it even before. This happens mostly when I stand up. I've had an MRI done before that and there was nothing wrong with it.I get headache, just for a short while and its really sharp. It hurts only on the left temple  til the bottom of my head. My head gets numb and so does half of my face and arms. I keep on forgetting even the words I use everyday. And basically everything a lot. I started to sleep walk too. Doctors didn't find anything, yeah.The doctors took several blood tests 6 months ago, and found out I was lacking vitamins. Vitamin B12, D, B6. I've been getting B12 injections and vitamin D and B6 supplements . nothing seems to get better. Instead, it seems like I've been getting more and more sick. I know that anxiety symptoms are the same... If it was 4 months ago, yea I was hella stressed, but now, even when I get chest pain or even if its hard to breathe I don't bother. And I still sometimes feel like my head is turning numb .It might be because of no exercise, but from like a week, when ever I even walk, o feel pressure in my head and neck and its really uncomfortable. I get a headache after wards.There's still a lot to this, but if the doctors thought it wasn't anything serious so it might not be...I hope soThis whole thing is a huge mess lolBut I'm really tired of the continuous s**t happening every day is a mess, and I'd be glad to find out what it really is.Thanks."

Heart Attack,Extreme exhaustion after heart attack.,"Many people after a heart attack mention extreme exhaustion and apparently this is fairly normal.  However my husband, aged 86 is so seriously fatigued that he doesn't have much quality of life.  The slightest effort, (walking a few yards) makes him have to sit down.  After eating a meal, (he only has a small appetite), he looks ready to collapse.  He had a heart attack four months ago and had angioplasty.He also had extreme anaemia and had two blood transfusions in hospital  but by all accounts the haemoglobin levels have gone up.   The heart nurse visits every  two weeks but neither she nor the doctor seem to appreciate how he is struggling through each day.  Having a shower, completely wears him out.   he tries hard  to move forward but today he tried to walk up our front drive and was frightened that he couldn't get back.   I know you may say, ""Well he is 86 years old"" and I realise that and it may be a question of us just accepting things but if there is something wrong, either with his blood or with the stent, then perhaps it could be corrected and he could enjoy his last few days, months or years.   No one in the medical profession seems to be taking us seriously.We have been married for nearly 60 years and it's crippling to see my husband like this.Any ideas or suggestions welcome."
Heart Attack,Post cardiac ablation,Does anyone know how long the soreness last after ablation it’s been two days and my groin feels like I got punched multiple times.

My heart feels funny I feel it beating in my throat but again it’s not fast or slow and doc said nothing is coming up on the tele monitor. Wondering if anyone else had this and when did there’s pass it is more of an uncomfortable feeling. ( I did tell my doctor about my symptoms I just want to hear from patients)

Heart Attack,Odd pain/sensation in heart area,"Hi all, About 5 months ago I started noticing an odd, dull pain in my heart area. It comes and goes and is about a 1/10 on the pain scale. I only notice is maybe 7-8 times a day. I went to the doctor and got an ECG, and I had an abnormality on the ECG. They sent me to a cardiologist and I got another ECG done that came back completely normal. The cardiologist told me he could get a echocardiogram done if I wanted to put my mind at ease, but the office told me it would be about $600 dollars.Yesterday I did some cardio and about 2 hours after I noticed the dull pain sensation was more frequent and often than before. My question is, are these types of aches and pains in the heart area normal, or should I spend the $600 to get the echocardiogram to rule out any possibility of abnormalities? The pain is like i said very minor, but it seems odd an not normal at all. I don't think it's heart burn as I believe heart burn is usually felt in the center of the chest?Thanks for any info or help. "

Heart Attack,Bony lumps on sternum,This is a repost of an old post of mine. I had my aortic valve replaced in May 2012. From the start I have felt a sharp piece of wire just under the skin in one place. Later I could feel several bony spurs on my sternum. Recently they have become bigger and although not actually painful I am aware of them. Even the water in the shower irritates them.Anyone else have them and how much did they grow or cause a problem. Googling also suggests that they could be calcium deposits.

Heart Attack,Strange feeling with my heart goes the past 2-3 days,"Firstly I’ll make it known that I’ve sufferd from anxiety since around the age of 7 (I’m 19 now) and I’m aware of the symptoms anxiety can cause. Recently I was doing really well with anxiety and didn’t really notice it too much until about a week ago I started getting random panic attacks at home which is rare for me, then I noticed my heart feeling strange, It’s almost like I’m constantly aware of it beating and it feels like a heavy thud in my chest and throat, I know most people label it to palpitations but I’ve never expearienced palpitations during my time with anxiety, so this is pretty new to me, and even when I feel like I’m calm and distracted I can still feel that my heart doesn’t feel right, I went to my doctors on Monday and he thinks I’m terms of blood pressure and pulse everything is fine. So even when I convince myself there’s nothing to worry about I still don’t feel 100%. I struggle to sleep at night because as soon as I lay down my heart instantly feels uncomfortable. Is this just a phase or is it something I should be concerned about? "

However, the next day, the same burning sensation is present in my left chest and I feel fatigued and dizzy.Could the doctor have misdiagnosed me? Is this actually a heart attack? When should I be convinced that it is not a heart attack or is a heart attack? What is causing the burning pain in my chest and how long will it last? "
Heart Attack,Anxiety vs Heart Problems ,So over the new year Holliday I went flying to see my family. This brought me a ton of anxiety because I was convinced that my plane would crash and it came to a point where it was all I could think about until I landed back home safely. A few days after that ordeal was over I noticed I was having heart palpitations so I went to the doctor/gp and she listened to my heart and I got an ekg/ecg and I got blood work done. She said I was fine as did a pulmonary/ sleep doctor who listened to my heart. I have started running the last few days and although no pain during exercise I have noticed a slight chest pain that is off and on . As well as muscle pains on my back and arm. I am so scared that I have something wrong with my heart I can't take it. Is there any good ways to tell the difference and  between them and when should I go to the ER I am so scared please help!So over the new year Holliday I went flying to see my family.

Heart Attack,Sever Shortness of breath  from 3 months,"It all started 3 months ago when suddenly In office, I was feeling short of breath and was feeling that I am going to faint.  it lasted for few minutes and went away. It came back again after 3 days and since then I had severe shortness of breath on walking, eating, talking etc. I have made emergency visits to hospital as well where they took ecg and said all was normal. I have had ECG, Echo, TMT , lung function test, all blood tests which all came normal. Doctros are writing it off as Anxiety. After few weeks, I developed Sleep apnea due to this which is moderate at the moment.  I also get dull chest pressure in centre sometimes. Sometimes, when I sleep, I feel short of breath and wake up. Anyone had similar expericne."
Heart Attack,Attempting to theorize,"Been living with a weird medical mystery for some time. I'm 20 years old now. Had a bad reaction to some medication about a year back and was left with some wild symptoms. Not exactly looking for a diagnosis to it, but I have a good question in regards to it that I just need some ideas for. Is there any kind of heart disturbance that could result in enlarged temporal arteries? The temporal arteries (or veins) are appearing as they would with temporal arteritis. However, that is geriatric and auto-immune and would be nearly impossible. Alongside, I had a C-reactive protein test and it detected no inflammation. Therefor there is another reason why they are enlarged. They are causing severe head pain right where they are inflamed.My heart has beating roughly 3x as hard and as fast when provoked since this condition started. Alongside, when provoked, I have gotten this sharp pressure-like pain in my legs. I have also had weird vascular issues in my arms (abnormally strong pulses in random areas, numbness when provoked, etc). In what ways could this be connected? Any ideas are appreciated. Thanks!"
Heart Attack,Heart attack ,I am wanting to connect with anyone who has recently or maybe some time ago had a heart attack. Am 47 years old and had a heart attack last Friday. I had a blood clot removed from my artery and a stent fitted Friday night. I have been discharged from hospital came home Monday eve. I am so so scared it is going to happen again. I am on my own during the day. And today I feel like I have a pain in my back and my chest but feel it could be just as am worrying and anxious. I took my spray and it seemed to calm down.  Does anyone have any advice to how I can move forward. I feel upset all the time but mainly just so so scared. Thank you 
Heart Attack,What does your chest pain feel like?,"Hi, new to the forum and new to having / currently diagnosing a heart condition... I've been asked by my (very angry) GP to track my symptoms in a note book for a month while we test out an emergency dose of Metoprolol. These are all the symptoms I've ignored and brushed off as something else (which is why my GP is quite mad at me since she feels I'm on the verge of a stroke and, putting it simply, may have damaged my heart.) In doing this, I realized I've gotten used to constant pain, so I'm curious what your chest pains and symptoms feel like. I feel like I'm just hyper-fixated since I actually have to pay attention and the things I'm jotting down are just normal body aches and pains... For me, there is about 1 to 4 times every three days or so where I get an episode that hits hard - a palpitation where I can't breath for 5-30 seconds and feel like I may pass out, or a radiating chest pain that hits my shoulder and up my neck which I have to hobble to the closest secluded area to lie down away from worrying eyes for 15 minutes to an hour - these I know are the bad ones. But then there is the every hour of every day, pulsing, aching, sharp stabbing, intermittent pain that doesn't knock me on my butt, it's just more annoying than anything and honestly I've gotten so used to it that I didn't even realize it was happening any more. The level of pain is on par with stubbing your toe or having heartburn, it’s uncomfortable sure, but not earth-shattering…So what about everyone else with chest pain? Do you feel this way? Is it terrible? Or is it just heartburn, tweaked nerves, sore back, the usual aches and groans of getting older…?I’m a 29 year old female by the way, if that helps. "
Heart Attack,Statins and severe muscle pain,"Has anyone else had severe muscle pain when taking atorvistatin? I was on Simastatin for 3 or 4 years, and then had an episode of mild chest pains.  After all the usual tests in the ER , my GP told me I had a blockage and must have a stent implanted IMMEDIATELY or I would have a heart attack and die.(I'm female age 70) I went to the hospital planning scared to death about the stent and after lots of tests and whatever they did to me was told you don't have a blockage you don't need a stent.  I kept telling everyone that worked on me in the hospital that my GP told me I HAD TO HAVE a stent or I would have a heart attack and die. The Cardiologist told me, nono, you don't have a blockage, you don't need a stent, but I'm going to put you on Atorvastatin. Thanks to the Atorvastatin, I am sure,  The pain in my muscles is unbearable, it is extremely painful to get up from a chair, or walk a few steps. Since then I had a heart attack, and I have been sent to a physical therapist, an orthopedic surgeon, another Cardiologist and a couple of other doctors.  I have also been prescribed 10 different kinds of pills.  I'm not taking any of them except a baby aspirin and vitamin D 100mgs or whatever they are called a day.Has anyone had this problem with the Atorvastatin & the extremely painful muscle problem. My GP said the problem was that statins flush a protein I think she said it was out of the muscles and causes this problem in a few people. I was very very healthy before I went to the ER with the very mild chest pains, Has anyone had this problem with muscle pain?  Thanks very much for any advice. "
Heart Attack,Heart attack or panic attack? ,"Hello! I suffer from health anxiety, and very much have a fear of having a heart attack. Tonight, I woke up with a bad pain between my shoulder blades and I was sweating. Since my immediate fear was that I was having a heart attack I looked to the internet to help me with signs and symptoms of a heart attack (not that I had not read them before). These of course are 2 signs of a heart attack but nothing more. My question or discussion I wanted to start was... if I am without severe chest pain or shortness of breath should I even be fearful of a heart attack? My issue is that not 1 heart attack is the same so there are clear definitions of this heart attack, I am left to wonder if every pain, sweat, uncomfortable feeling is a heart attack, I’m very tired of living with this fear. Please help, any insight is helpful. Ps: pain between my shoulder blades is gone now. Just this lingering acheyness. "
Heart Attack,My resting Heart rate was about 50 a few months ago but has now dropped to 47,"I am a 47 YO male. No health problems apart from higher than normal cholesterol levels whilst onlt being moderatrely overweight.I bought a good digital watch with what seems to be an accurate heart rate monitor and noticed the resting heart rate consistently below 60. I went to see the doctor and she took a reading at 60. I got an ECG done and I think the reading was the same but there was no problems with the ECG. But maybe, my heart rate was higher at the doctors due to nerves etc? My resting heart rate, according to my watch has dropped to about 47.On occasion i do get dizzy but it is rare, and maybe due to irregular diet patterns. I tend to experiment with different fasting diets like 5-2 diet and no breakfast etc.Do I have BradyCardia?"

Heart Attack,Ectopic atrial arrhythmia on a paced heart,"Hi everyone, my mother is a 90 yo with hypertension, full heart block and meditronic pacer. Recently she has been having episodes of ectopic atrial arrhythmia which have been making her very unwell. Hospitalised 3 times in 2 weeks. I have not yet spoken personally to her cardio, but he seems not overly concerned other than the negative impact on the longevity of the pacer. They are wanting to discharge her and told her to wait until her cardio appointment in two weeks which makes me uneasy. Can anyone give me any idea as to what could cause ectopic atrial beats on a paced heart? Her electrolytes were down with each episode as well. Thanks in advanceMatt "
Heart Attack,ectopic heartbeats are driving me mad!,"HiCan anyone suggest a remedy for stopping my ectopic beats?   They started about 6 months ago, probably due to prolonged anxiety.   I've had 2 ecgs, an eco test and a 24 hour monitor.  My doctor has said everything looks normal but it feels far from that once the ectopic beats take hold.I seem to  be going round in circles with this, a few days without them, which is such a relief and then back they come for no apparent reason.  They usually start mid afternoon and then continue for about 24 hours.  I dread trying to sleep as they seem to increase once I'm in bed and of course anxiety only intensifies them.I take magnesium tablets, and have found that cutting out alcohol and caffine doesn't make any difference.  I've read that beta blockers can help, has anyone had any success with these?Having found this forum, its been quite a relief to discover this seems to be quite a common problem.Hopefully someone will respond to my post!"
Heart Attack,Possible Angina/CAD aged 28? Please read,"Hello there, I have a few questions regarding Angina Pain/Chest Pain.What is the possibility of a 28 year old man having Angina/CAD?And yes I'm talking about myself lol.Basically I have always had chest pain. It started when I was 17 due to Anxiety. I have a Generalised Anxiety Disorder which I take medication for. Propranolol 40mg and Citalopram 10mg daily which I have taken for 10 years.  Over the past year (2017) I have presented myself to A&E over 6 times with very very uncomfortable chest pains.  The pain can either be Central (Behind my sternum) or to the left side behind my nipple. 90% of the time the pain is located behind my sternum. I can only describe it as a tight ache. OFTEN along with this pain I get a squeezing sensation in my left lower bicep, and also a ache in my left forearm. The pain in my chest can last anywhere from 30 minutes to 4-5 hours and comes at rest. I've noticed lately my legs ache too..I've spoken to doctors about this, and I have had 8 EKGs and blood tests what all came back normal.  Apart from the last test which discovered I have Type 2 Diabetes and also high cholesterol of 7.9 ratio.  I was put on Atorvastatin which did not agree with me.  I used to suffer heartburn but rarely do now as I take a PPI when I can.In all honesty I'm fairly inactive, my diet is terrible (I'm looking to change that) and I am a smoker of around 20 per day.The only symptoms regarding my chest pain are - Central Chest tightness, Left sharp pain behind nipple and also left pain in my arm. This has been progressing for around 1 year to  date.I have spoken to doctors and the only reply they give is ""There is nothing wrong with your heart""How reassuring is this? Yeah.. I'm an idiot and I Google alot. Hence why I'm here...I'm just looking for some advice from anybody who has any knowledge and information for me. I'm 28 years old, 6ft 1. Have a bottle of a belly (16st 8lbs). Not an active person with a poor diet. I have smoked for 15 years 20 a day.Any advice I am grateful. Thank you x"
Heart Attack,My open heart recovery is not getting better. Am I alone?,"In April 2017 I underwent open heart surgery to repair my mitral valve and a quadruple bypass. My recovery started off normal but quickly went south as I continued to suffer from pleural effusions in both lungs. Long story short it took me 3 months to get back on my feet again and back to work. In July 2017 I suffered from my first symptoms of heart block and since then I have suffered 3 more times of symptoms of heart block with the most recent one last week. Since the surgery, my resting heart rate is around 108 and during the times of heart block symptoms, besides the irregular heart rhythm, my heart rate drops down between 45 and 60. I am now trying my third cardiologist this year due to the frustration of hearing that they don't understand what is wrong. They have ruled out constrictive pericarditis and I have not experienced any pleural effusions since May of 2017. They still have not been able to understand why my resting heart rate is so high and why I sometimes experience heart block symptoms.I continually read stories of people after open heart surgery and how they feel 10 times better than before. My surgeon and doctors all told me that it would happen to me as well. However, it has been a year since I first went to the ER when I suffered Congestive Heart Failure and a small Heart Attack. I feel worse today than a year ago and I am unable to still to do any major exertion to my body since the surgery. I walk every day with my dog and daughter around the park and I am eating healthy than I ever have in my life. Am I alone here? Has anyone else experienced this and do you have any suggestions? I am 44 years old with a 3-year-old daughter. I want to be able to run around with her again and do the things a father does with their kids at that age. What can I do to better my life?p.s. My heart disease was the cause of radiation treatments when I was 12 for Hodgkins Disease cancer. "
Heart Attack,pvcs ectopics with position change,"Im 33 year old male, started getting ectopic beats a few yeas back. Was given bisoprolol low dose but caused 3 episodes of fast heart arrhythmia so i discontinued instantly, ecg showed iRBBB which i think may have had something to do with it  now im left with the same ectopics as befor but new occasional episodes where they come very frequent(2-3 per min) and feel like they are triggered by something ie cold weather, laying down in bed ,bad stomach issues ect, episodes last few hours aprox. im wondering if anybody else has had similar issues?  i also notice that when i go from standing to sitting my heart usually throws out a few ectopics(PVCS) also heart feels like its struggling to beat(pounds hard) with that position change which makes me wonder if its something to do with heart rate, ie going from faster heart rate(standing) to slower heart rate(sitting) or maybe blood pressure? ive had echo, stress test, ecg, holter ect and came back clear but these was before the new symptoms caused by the beta blockers. hospital and doctors have no interest  in trying to capture the new symptoms which has led me to put in a complaint to the nhs which i really didn't want to do but i know that im being shrugged of   im learning to cope with stress anxiety ect and dealing with ectopics  but would love to know if anybody else has had similar symptoms exp, ect. Any feedback greatly appreciated   Also few other bits of info, been told by cardio - postural hypo tension and sinus tachy, was told ectopics are mainly pvcs.Symptoms now(after beta blocker) pounding heart comes and goes, low heart rate in the evening(50s) hi heart rate in the mornings 120+(standing) episodes of more frequent ectopics(occurs once a week aprox, last for a few hours then goes, possibly triggered?dizziness on and off and sharp stabbing chest pains(although i suspect abdominal issues for this, wind bloating ect),  strong buzzing sensation in chest.cant help but think my vagus nerve is involved in all this somehow."
Heart Attack,Low resting heart rate,"I'm a 59 year old male and suffered a mild heart attack in December 2016. My resting heart rate seems to be on a downward trend, is this because of my increase in exercise (walking & circuit training) and just getting fitter? (though I could hardly be described as an athlete).As I understand it a ‘normal’ heart rate is somewhere from mid 50’s to lower 60’s but I am on beta blockers for hypertension which will suppress my heart rate. I feel fine so not worried by this decline but wondered how low would be considered cause for concern?"
Heart Attack,Do you think I should get a second opinion?,"So about 5 months ago my parents took me to a cardiologist to see why my heart rate was going up so high so the cardiologist did multiple ekg’s, x-ray of my chest, echocardiogram, 7 day holter monitor and they all came back to be okay, but I had low bp so he put me on florinef 0.1 once a day and half of that at night. It’s really helped my blood pressure and my hr somewhat but my hr still goes up to 150 bpm or more when just walking for like 5 minutes. I don’t understand why this happen if there’s nothing wrong with me. Should I still be concerned?"
Heart Attack,What does it mean?,Hi i had a 24hr ecg because i have been waking at night with palpitations and my results have come back saying ‘no significant Arrhythmias and that the tecordings were sinus rhythm.Can anybody tell me whst this actually means please? I dont feel like i have an explication to my palpitations.Thankyou

","Tests revealing my treated Ventricular Tachycardia also revealed other heart defects.Now the hospital and arrhythmia cardiologist that treated my VT says I have a good strong heart now, but the heart failure cardiologist from the other hospital that is also investigating me sent me a letter, on which was various diagnosis, one of which is Mid LAD disease.No mention of severity or any advice, in fact I was unaware of this particular diagnosis.I touch worrying in that unlike my arrhythmia, this appears to be more closely related to the breaking off of plaque that killed both my Maternal Grandmother, and my maternal Uncle, both at a younger age than I.  "

Heart Attack,Pericarditis returned?,I was put in the hospital in June of 2016 for suspected pericarditis and I’m having similar pains now. Sharp sudden pains through the left side of the chest. Shortness of breath. Feels better if I lean forward. Dry cough sometimes as well. I have autoimmune disorders such as arthritis and they suspect sjogrens. My inflammation levels are always very elevated along with my ANA levels. I also have hypothyroidism that’s currently out of control because the medicine wasn’t adjusted. Could it be pericarditis again? Thanks for any help guys.If it helps I was just in the ER two weeks ago with very similar chest pains. The only findings were the TSH and inflammation levels were high. CT of lungs were fine. And ekg only found slight abnormalities and my lower left chamber in my heart a little enlarged. Said everything was normal and sent me home. I’ll be seeing my new doctor on Tuesday and will ask him about this.
Heart Attack,Should I go to the ER?!,So I am 18 and I have been having some heart palpitations and believed it to be caused in part by possible sleep apnea so about 4-5 days ago I went to the doctor and got it checked out and I got my ecg/ekg and my doctor said everything was normal. But then I went running about 2 days ago and although no pain my heart rate was high for hours after running. And now for the last day or so I have been having slight little bits of pain around my chest/ upper area that only last for a few seconds but are noticeable. It has not really been centralized to where my heart is but around my chest and I am kind of worried. I don't have a car so I don't want have someone bring me to the hospital unless it gets worse or seems life threatening. I haven't had any other symptoms other than the palpitations and slight short lasting chest pain. I don't want to go into cardiac arrest or something and want to get it fixed.

Heart Attack,So tired of being worried all the time.,The last few weeks I have very nervous that I have a heart problem due to sleep apnea and that I am going to have a cardiac arrest. I went to the doctor last week and got an EKG/ECG and everything was fine and I have a sleep study consultation next Tuesday. I was doing good for a couple of days until yesterday when I went running and now my heart has been beating fast and I have even had some slight pain not on my heart but around it. I am so scared I am afraid to sleep at night and I am so tired of fearing for my life. Has anyone experienced this before? it is so frustrating. Should I be worried? Thanks so much.

Heart Attack,Cardiac tamponade: is it painful?,"Hello,My 10 years old son left us last week end after having a heart attack and I have some questions related to that.Last Saturday everything was normal until he puked around 3pm and 4:30pm. He wasn't feeling very well but I didn't think much of it; I stupidity thought it was a small stomach ache and since my son wasn't complaining I didn't do anything other than put him to bed and check on him.Around 5pm he puked again while lying in his bed and he wasnt moving at all so I tried to wake him up but even though he had his eyes open he just wouldn't move. I rushed to the hospital and in the car he was very odd, like half asleep. I talked to him the entire time but it was like he wasn't even listening to me he was just not here with me... When we arrived at the hospital finally talked to me and told me he wanted to walk so I was very reassured and let him walk on it's own to the emergency room. Less than 2 minutes after we arrived the doctors took him since I called them in the car to tell them something was very wrong and it was urgent. But less 2 minutes after they took him he had a first heart attack. They saved him but he had a second heart attack a few minutes later. The doctors told me he had a cardiac tamponade and a heart tumor and it was extremely dangerous. Sunday morning my little boy had another heart attack but they couldn't save him this time...All this time my boy had this horrible heart tumor and none of us had any idea about it... his blood tests were good (7 months ago) and he had zero symptoms, I don't understand.I want to know if a cardiac tamponade is painful or not. The doctors told me my little boy was probably too comatose to feel any pain but I'm not convinced.

Heart Attack,Heart Beat still feel a little weird 8 hours after running.,"So late yesterday afternoon/ early evening I went running with my dad (which was the first time I did so in probably two months) and I felt nothing unusual as I ran, however my heartrate was pretty high which is usual but it still felt fast hours after I ran and as I was going to bed I felt like there was maybe heart palpitations. Last Tuesday I went to the doctor about heart palpitations possibly due to sleep apnea and I got my heart checked and even an EKG/ECG and my doctor said I was fine. But could running trigger something bad in my heart or is just because I don't run as often? Should I be worried? I am afraid I will die of cardiac arrest or something along those lines. I am 18 and have a bmi of 26 and my vitals were all normal at the doctor on Tuesday.

Heart Attack,Had blood tests and ECG’s but still feel like something is wrong with heart.,"I have suffered from health anxiety very badly for the last year, I am on 50mg of setraline and see a therapist weekly, I am trying my hardest to be positive but it is extremely difficult. For the last week or so I haven’t felt right at all, I’ve been getting chest pains, pain in my back, pain in my jaw and arm, chest tightness and lightheadedness, I’ve been to the hospital twice in the last week, had 2 ecgs and a set of blood tests which have all come back normal, so why do I STILL feel like something is wrong? My chest feels very tight and my arm is hurting.. is it possible there is a problem with my heart that the doctors haven’t noticed? I am a 20 year old female who gave up smoking 6 months ago after smoking for 7 years, I work at McDonald’s so my diet isn’t very good but I am not overweight at all."

Heart Attack,Stress ECG results and chest pain,"Hi all, I'm worried sick because of this. This is a rather long post...I went to the emergency last week with pain in left arm, shoulder, armpit, chest and shoulder. They took a chest xray and some bood, discharged me and declared I'm good, maybe some muscle issue.I also did a stress ecg with a private clinic because my annual health screening ecg was not normal. The results are brief: borderline positive exercise stress test, baseline ecg: sinus rhythm with short PR, recovery: minor ST depression late recovery, stress ecg- upsloping ST depression. When I collected the results, the doctor just said that they will refer me to a cardiologist, who will probably do an angiogram. Other than that, he did not explain the findings. I'm terrified to hear this.I am femalehfemale, 34, I have normal bp but elevated cholesterol level. Does this mean i definitely have some heart disease??"
Heart Attack,Heart failure at 24? Or anxiety,"Hello!I'm 24 and I've been experiencing ongoing heart palpitations that started a few years ago after I had the flu. Due to life events I also had a panic attack and was diagnosed with anxiety 4 years ago.For the last year or two I have been feeling progressively breathless almost all the time, the palpitations I can feel even when standing up and I have about 7-20 a minute which makes my heart feel like it's fluttering.I need 3 pillows to sleep at night otherwise the palpitations are worse and I can't breathe.Going up the stairs makes me very breathless and tachycardic.  I'm always fatigued, breathless and my heart racing plus I get random chest pain. I've had an echo 2 years ago which came out fine but I have premature ventricular contractions.I have gained weight in the last 4 years which I'm sure have been contributing to the breathing but I can't excercise long enough as I become fatigued.Now what's hard explaining to people is that I'm not anxious when I get these sensations.. infact those sensations make me feel anxious. Does that can make sense?Does this sound to you more like anxiety or something heart related."
Heart Attack,"High Blood Pressure, Chest Discomfort","Hello everybody! My name is Andy, I am male 36 years old.Let me give you little bit of my medical history that concerns me: - Since age 30 I used to have chronic stress, a loving family member has died, and I was also unemployed for some time - really hard period for me.- By the age of 32 chronic stress has led me to chest discomfort symptoms, headaches, and high blood pressure. I had panic attacks. I have visited cardiologists and hospital, which I came out to be ""healthy"" and didn't give me any meds for bp. I had plenty of ECGs and Stress ECGs and heart echos, all results came out clean.- Now I am 36. I don't think I have stress anymore, I have a pretty good job and a beautiful family. But Hypertension is still there....So, for the past year my average daily bp was 180/110 (<--- yes, true number) for the most time of the day ..... there were days I had up to 210/120, and days which I had down to 160/100 for the most part of the day....I never felt any symptoms other than being light headed. I made a lot of visits to the health center...each time they managed to drop my bp down to 160/100 and I was ""really"" happy with it since it was my lowest bp in the past years! (imagine that).Finally a cardiologist gave me high bp meds which I take for the past 7 months... my average bp now is 125/85.Nevertheless, all minor or major symptoms have faded away and I feel like a normal person , well most of the day...So my concerns are: Rarely I do get chest discomforts, a lot of stubbing pain in the chest area (like knife stabbing), I got a heart burn just a few minutes ago (thats why i am here writing this), and a lot of tachycardia with no apparent reason..well I got my last ECG 2 days ago, complaining of dizzyness, the ECG ruled out dizzyness to be a heart issue, doctor said might be bad posture..but ok.....well if there was any heart problem the ECG would have shown it right?? I mean all this stabbing pain and heart burns, ECG was clean so I have nothing to worry about right? or do I have to worry? The cardiologist said I am fine (based on the ECG)...how long does an ECG cover? months? years? could there be any heart damage after all this time with very high bp? or stress is back and i get my old chest discomforts...? how should i rule out any of these symptoms since the cardio told me I am fine? should i visit doctors with different specialities? (neurologist, pulmonologist etc?)"

Heart Attack,"Help: My mother passed away 2 weeks after Valve Replacement/Bypass surgery, what went wrong?","My mother was coughing for the past one year. We did several tests, went to pulmonologist, did CT scans, Chest X-Ray, etc.  They said that she has an Interstitial Lung disease. They did an echocardiaogram and found out that here Aortic valve was very narrow and she had aortic stenosis and her valve had to be replaced immediately.  They did a cardiac cath and confirmed that the valve was very narrow and it was important to do the surgery ASAP.  My mother did not have any symptoms. She walks regularly every day, no blood pressure, no sugar and all her vitals were normal. Except for the cough.  The cardiologists and the thoracic surgeons team also found that they she had a blockage in the artery and recommended a bypass to be done along with the valve replacement.  We asked them the level of risk. They said the risk is 1-2% and that she will have a very good quality of life after the surgery as she was otherwise a healthy person with no symptoms. We were really convinced. Although my mother was not fully convinced for the surgery as she felt perfectly fine except for the cough and she didn't feel any symptoms.  Pulmonologist calls up a week before the surgery and says that she has pulmonary edema, and it is because of the aortic aortic stenosis and the blood was not able to flow thru the valve because of the which the fluids were going to her lungs which caused her to cough.The surgery was scheduled 3 weeks later on the 3rd week of December.  The surgery was 10-10 1/2 hours long.  She had bleeding during the surgery and they had to do a blood transfusion and everything went ok.  She woke up the next day in SICU with a change in her voice.  She spoke to the family, but still under partial sedation. She had trouble swallowing the food because of the tube. She was in SICU for 7 days,  with the chest tubes and all the other tubes, trying to drain the fluids from the lungs.  They gave her lasix, hydro codine for the pain and several other medications including aspiring lipitor, insulin, metoprolol etc.  My mother was not able to sleep properly in the SICU as she was coughing and it was really hurting to cough.  She was tired and weak.  She also had trouble breathing.  The doctors insisted that she was progressing and she was getting better.  They said that the pain would get better in 4-6 weeks. She was able to walk although she had a tough time breathing after a couple of steps. Nurses said she was strong and she was progressing. After 7 days she was shifted to Progressive care unit(PCU) on the 7th night. She was still not able to sleep properly and was in pain.  Hydro codine relieved her pain. But, she insisted that she still had discomfort. Surgeons said that she will be fine in 2-3 weeks.  She was in PCU for 2-3 days and was discharged.  She came home, was feeling tired to walk.  She slept in a recliner chair, tried to sleep had partial sleep.  Was able to take shower with help, walked for 5 mins 2 times a day,  Seemed like she was progressing.  On 1st of January she had dinner at 7:30-8 pm.  After dinner, she walked to recliner chair and sat and she said she was shivering.  We put blankets on her, turned on the heat and for 5-7 mins she was shivering. We were thinking of calling 911, She said 5 mins. We were asking her if she was ok.  Suddenly, she started breathing heavily and she was having a tough time breathing, and suddenly in 2 mins she stopped breathing.  Her heart was not beating and there was no pulse.  In 2 mins paramedics arrived were trying to revive her,  took her to ER and tried for 45 mins and they said they could not revive her and she was dead.  I am so shocked and not able to accept her death.  I don't have answers to what happened in the last 5 mins.  Doctor in the ER said, she might have had arrhythmia. But nobody is sure as to what exactly happened.  Seemed like she was recovering, was able to have a shower,  walk, eat on her own. This is not an unusual surgery and it's been performed on so many millions of people over so many decades.  Why did it fail on my mother.  It's been a week since she passed away,  i am still in shock and not able to accept it.  Can somebody please tell me if this has happened to anybody in their family.   "
Heart Attack,Skipped heart beats some days ,"I am a 26 year old male that has been cursed for a few years of skipped heartbeats out of nowhere and sometimes a racing heart that I stop by crouching, putting my knees to my chest and do deep breathing. This stops the racing normally but a couple times I’ve played basketball and got bumped and then my heart just took off racing. I have been to my doctor and she tells me it’s nothing to worry about it’s just a normal thing and my anxiety makes me feel them and makes them worse. I sometimes get skipped beats all day for days straight then get some with none. I wore a Holter monitor once when I was in my early teens and docs said nothing and once again 2 years ago and again doc said nothing alarming. I have a hard time playing these off as anxiety due to the fact they are random and come when I’m not even worried about anything. Also just 3 days ago I jogged 2 miles with no break in 30 min and I did get heart skips while running, if I had to guess I’d say maybe 10-12 times. But I wasn’t extremely winded or collapsing, so maybe my heart is strong? I guess I’m just wondering if anyone els goes through this and maybe some advice. Thanks. "

Heart Attack,Chest pain & Shortness of breath,"For the last week I have been having mild chest pain (left side near armpit area mostly) and am having a hard time getting a good deep breath. I also have pain in my upper abdomen. I had a stent put in my widow maker almost 2 years ago, so as you can imagine I worry over the slightest thing. I've been trying to call my cardiologist but just get the answering machine. Not sure what I should do. I went to the ER back in September for chest pain, but everything was fine. EKG, Stress Test....all good. I don't seem to have any other symptoms. Although, yesterday and today my entire rib cage hurts (front & back) I am a 49 yr old female. Otherwise good health, take my medications. Yes, I smoke but have cut back drastically since being told in September that I have the beginning of COPD.

Heart Attack,Severe Chest Pains After Dentist Procedure,"So I got numbed and I felt a weird sensation but I passed it off.

I breathe through but notice I’m short of breath and just don’t feel good. So few more days with the sharp pains. I get weaker and more tired. I freeze constantly but rarely run a fever. I’m not sure what’s going on but I know I’m under lots of stress do to the cap repeatedly falling off but this feels more. Should I check it out at the doctors next week? Could it be Endocarditis?

Heart Attack,Holter monitor results,"Please can someone tell me what this means, see below, is it just a way of saying that I have an irregular heartbeat?

Heart Attack,Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia & Ivabradine?,"Hi guys! Im a 20yr old female so had an ablation aug 1st for SVT. Since then I have been SVT free! Woohoo! But I have also been diagnosed with IST since then, and have been struggling to manage. I was diagnosed 4 days ago, and was prescribed Ivabradine for it with promising results. I have also been tested for POTS & I do not have that. My symptoms are constant lightheadedness, racing heart rate with minimal exertion and fatigue. However I do have a normal heart rate while resting but it does skyrocket with minimal exertion. I have symptoms regardless of my heart rate(symptoms are more intense with higher HR) but my electrophysiologist believes it is from my prolonged IST that has caused some damage to my system. Any thoughts? Anyone with IST? Is it normal to have symptoms with normal HR? Anyone on IVabradine? Thank you! "

Heart Attack,Help - Rythym Issues,"Hello Everyone,Any insight, thoughts, course of action would be appreciated as well as how my overall prognosis looks.I am a 28 YO Male, healthy weight, no health issues or medications other than what I am about to describeI have been dealing with heart issues for over 10 years now and first started having problems around 16-17. My primary symptom I have had all these years is a feeling as if my chest has gone weightless and takes my breath away followed by a massive POP and a rush of warmth in my feet all unfolding around about 2-3 seconds. There has never been any pain, dizziness, fainting or shortness of breath associated with these. At the time (11 years ago) I ended up in the ER a few times and had EKG and blood work done. I also later got another EKG, Echo, and treadmill as well as 24 hour holter done at that time ordered by my doc. All came back negative however I was never given a firm diagnosis although I never had a big ""pop"" during any tests either. I call them a ""pop"" as I have never had any diagnosis but from what I have read the most likely explanation is that they are PVCs. Do these tests provide any reassurance 11 years later?Around 5 years ago during a sporing event I had crushing chest pain the evening after witnessing a fellow competitor suffer a heart attack that day I had blood work and ekg and monitoring for around 5-10 hours and all was well that is the last cardiac testing I have had beyond the doc listening to my heart 3 years ago at a check up.The ""pops"" continued off and on for 11-12 years. Thinking back they also began creeping in during excercise around 3 years ago which also coincides to me falling into terrible physical condition relatively speaking. Although it is only during the last few months that I began to think about these again.Here is where I am today:About 6-7 months ago I had what seemed like 20-30 ""pops"" in one evening after a couple glasses of wine and a big meal and a bad fight with the Mrs. Ever since then my life has been slowly going down hill I have withered away both mentally and physically. I have lost 20 lbs due to anxiety killing my appetite and muscle loss due to quiting my workouts.In summary I am now getting 1-20 ""pops"" a day I may have had a total of 5-10 days with none since June. And now 50% of the time I will get 1-3 with any prolonged significant exertion which I heard is the marker of death relating to these. They are usually triggered by a big inhalation when excercising, right at the top when the lungs are full before I exhale the heart will misfire or ""pop"".I am also worried I am predisposed to heart issues. One of my grandfathers has been dealing with Afib since his early 80s and his abalation did not work. He is now 90 but is on heart meds and may not be able to live at home much longer on his own.My other theory is that an infection has destroyed the wiring in my heart as I have an identical twin who suffers no such issues."
Heart Attack,Feels like heart is expanding and immense pressure in neck arteries,"Hi, any help on these symptoms I have been having on and off for about 6 months, but they have become very frequent and they seem to be getting worse.Out of the blue, anytime, standing, sitting, lying down, my heart will feel like it blows up like a balloon. I feel tremendous pressure in my neck arteries and seemingly the back of my head/ears. If I put my finger on the pulse in the neck after it is really pounding and jumping. Sometimes it feels as though no oxygen is getting to the brain. As quick as it comes it goes, the pressure goes and 'i feel' my heart 'deflate'.It is stopping me sleep at night as I get wound up and anxious when I get one. In the daytime I seem to be able to work around them, but do often have to stop what I'm doing to let it pass.Any ideas what this could be?Many thanks."

One time the pain was so bad it lasted 40 minutes. My arms also sometimes feel tingly. My mother has epilepsy, so maybe that would explain the dizziness, but I'm not sure. I'm very worried for my health. Please respond."
Heart Attack,Cardiologists and time travel!? Cardiologist discharged me 1 month before reviewing my echocardiogra,"I recently had a cardio appointment to investigate the symptom of palpitations on 11 of October.I note that the discharge letter I received is dated the same day as my consultation with the cardiologist 11of October.At the same appointment she suggested that she'll arrange a stress test ECG and an echocardiogram. But she didn't think there was any cause for concern.The echocardiogram and stress test I had 14&16 of November. The discharge letter did have an addendum in which to my surprise stated that I have mitral valve prolapse with trivial regurgitation.Now I am no cardiologist but looks to me like she wasn't expecting to see anything to report when she wrote the discharge letter a whole month before any useful investigation had actually been done!!?Then I get another letter dated 7of December.... I now also have a mild tricuspid valves regurgitation!??Personally disgusted that I didn't even get to hear about my heart disease in a consultation yet alone receive the results in two letters one of which was written before she had even seen my echocardiogram!???How?"
Heart Attack,Right ventricular dilation with impaired function,"Hi guys, have been trying to make sense of a letter my father has received following an echo scan. Basically he’s found over the last 18months to have massively lost the ability to walk any distance, breathlessness, dizziness and swollen feet/ankles. Following this echo he has been given an appointment to see a cardiologist. The letter statesRight ventricular dilation with impaired functionestimated severe pulmonary hypertension with associated severe tricuspid regurgitation Pleural effusionIs anyone able to provide a simplified explaination of what that means?, what are the implications and likely options available to him,  it’s taken so long for any diagnosis or any sortMany thanks"
Heart Attack,"Just started treatment for suspected dilated cardiomyopathy, what can I do to help?","After echocardiograms, ECGs and an MRI (ejection fraction 55%) my cardiologist has just started me on Ramipril (2.5mg daily) and I will start on Bisoprolol (2.5mg daily) in a couple of weeks. My dad died of dilated cardiomypathy, so the cardiologist might be a bit over-cautious. I'm a keen (but slow) jogger, but my BMI is 24.9 which at the fattest end of ""normal"". I do sometimes get stress-related chest pain, but no other symptoms. I'm a 48 year old male.If possible I'd like to take steps to improve my health before my next echocardiogram, in the hope of being given the option of reducing or even stopping the drugs. Are these things likely to help?1) Reduce my BMI to the lower half of the ""normal"" range.2) Try to re-think the way I deal with stressful situations.3) Carry on jogging (although I'm worried the Bisoprolol might interfere with that when I start it)."
Heart Attack,Diltiazem Side Effects,I have just recently in the last month had a huge increase in heart rate and blood pressure.  Tried beta blocker gave me insomnia.  Dr. just switched me to diltiazem.  I have been on it three days which isnt long but everytime I take it I get a escalation in heart rate and it isnt helping my BP at all.  I get a lot of facial flushing also.  Even if my heart rate gets down in the high 80's it feels like its pounding.  Has anyone had these side effectsI have just recently in the last month had a huge increase in heart rate and blood pressure.  Tried beta blocker gave me insomnia.  Dr. just switched me to diltiazem.  I have been on it three days which isnt long but everytime I take it I get a escalation in heart rate and it isnt helping my BP at all.  I get a lot of facial flushing also.  Even if my heart rate gets down in the high 80's it feels like its pounding.  Has anyone had these side effects

Anyway, I went to the hospital last year as I noticed my heart rate (not resting) had dropped from 52bps (resting) to 41bps (middle of the day, sat up) They first said I must be very fit, I'm not VERY fit, I am in shape but due to pain in my legs I can't do more than a bit of walking. Anyway, they since diagnosed me with POTS syndrome bit haven't actually looked at A. why I have a very low bpm (when not standing and B. why it has dropped so much in the last 8 years.

Heart Attack,Just looking for some helpful adive!,"I recently was admitted to emergency for a random spike in my heart rate, up to a consistent 150-160 beats per minute. They did bloods and a chest x ray at the hospital which same back clear. Since then ive had a 24 hour holter, 2 ECGs, a heart ultra sound and multiple bloods. The doctors have pushed it off to anxiety and occasional off beats. But i really don't feel all that anxious. I get sudden strong palpation randomly. I've also been expercing chest,jaw and back pain. Was just wondering if there is any point in going back to the doctor?? I would of thought if there was something wrong it would of been picked up, but still getting some strange symptoms. Cheers"
Heart Attack,"Slow heart rate and chest pains, should I be concerned ?","So iv been having some strange things going on in my body the last month or so and I'm wondering if anyone can give me some incite on what might be going on. The last two weeks have been the worst as far as me worrying about what might be wrong with me, I have been experiencing chest pain mostly on the left side with a strange feeling that my heart is bound by something (not like crushing but like a mild pressure), I'v also noticed that my resting heart rate drops to low 50's and iv had a few palpitations.The last 3 nights every time I'm about to fall asleep it feels like my heart stops or i stop breathing and i jolt awake and cant get back to sleep for hours. I will add iv also lost weight since feeling unwell and iv noticed my fingernail beds are much more red than i remember. feeling unwell and having all these symptoms has caused my stress and anxiety levels to increase so I'm in a situation where I cant figure out if the symptoms are something serious or something brought on with high levels of anxiety.I'm a 24yo male and one last side note, I just got over a pretty bad flu and some sort of infection right after, not sure if that might be of interest regarding my symptoms.   "

Heart Attack,Discomfort and heart palpitations,"Last night I was up from 2:30 am to around 5 am.  I could not go back to sleep for this long time. I felt discomfort but did not know exactly what it was. I was tossing and turning and at one point I think I was about to fall asleep however I felt a discomfort in my chest. I noticed my heart started raising and pounding. When I checked my Fitbit watch it showed 90 pulse rate while I was in bed. It started getting higher and last time I checked it was 104. At that point, I sat up and tried not to listen to my heartbeat. It was hard not to pay attention to the rapid beats because when you lay down I guess it is more noticeable. Yesterday I  walked and I did my other regular activities. I had about 140000 steps altogether. I like keeping myself busty which keeps my mind away from the tension that something is wrong with me or with my heart. But this kind of episodes brings my anxiety back. I thought I would get a good night sleep but it was the other way. My palpitation was not for too long but I just don't know why it came to me last night. Exercise should help not to make us sick. I am a regular walker and even lately I started taking stairs too. I take about two flights of stairs when I can. Do you think I should consult a doctor? Every time I go to him he talks about anxiety. I guess I am on my own. I am sad and don't know why I am going through this Thanks to all.  "

Heart Attack,"heart murmur, should I be worried?","hi all,I went to the doctors complaining of stabbing chest pain when breathing in as well as shortness of breath and other random chest pains as well. I also told him about my predominantly right sided headaches and a very terrifying experience I had of my vision cutting out suddenly for a split second then returning, as if a light at been switched off then back on again.he checked my heart and he found a heart murmur and I am going to be sent a letter about an ultrasound of my heart soon.should I be worried about this? he said it could be harmless because I am young but that it should still be checked. how does the letter work? how long do they take?thankyou"
Heart Attack,worried about my heart? not sure what to do,"hello all,i would like to start this off by saying i’m a relatively “healthy” looking 17 year old, i am not obese/overweight - however i don’t have a great diet and i try to rectify this by going on healthy diets avoiding crisps and chocolate and the like but i always fall back. i would go walks everyday to school and recently i have went longer walks because i no longer do compulsory pe at school but i don’t think it’s enough and i can’t bring myself to start a proper exercise routine. i want to change this but i find it very difficult to stick to something like a diet program without getting hungry all the time or an exercise routine without wanting to stay in bed all day especially weekends i went to doctors recently about weird occurrences in right side of my head like pain behind my right eye constantly, headaches, pressure, whooshing sounds of my pulse in my right ear only when turning head to left and wearing earphones, so i told them about this unusual right sided pain as it never happened on left side, ever. doctor said it was blocked sinuses and gave me spray and it actually helped quite a lot! don’t have any leaky noses anymore or tearing eyes, i was essentially having a perpetual cold and it was helping it. went to opticians just to check eyes like with the hot air balloon test and pressure test, they found nothing except blisters in my eyelids emphasising that it was worse in my right eyelid which made sense because of the specifically right sided pain. eyedrops also helped specific eye pain.however i still have worrisome problems that have come up.i still have pain in my right side of head and two absolutely terrifying instances happened to me. one in my home and one in school. i was sitting on my bed watching youtube videos when a sudden pang in my head right side struck behind the eye and was extremely severe and agonising. i felt like i was being stabbed in the head. it travelled all the way to the back of my head right side and kept pulsating. after 15 seconds it was gone. my right eye was tearing up. i checked eye in mirror nothing out of ordinary just wateriness. i was so scared and shocked and i went to bed for rest. when it happened again in school i knew it was coming because the exact same kind of stabbing burning pain was arising in my right eye. it was while my english teacher was talking to me and i was so upset because i couldn’t even concentrate on most of what she was saying. then again, it went away as soon as it came about. this is amongst chest pains. when i breathe in deep or move my torso quick the left side of my chest underneath my breast it’s a very sharp pain. when i lean backwards it’s like a relentless burning pain, again on left side. i thought that it might be indigestion but it will be random and not after eating. worried it was heart related i checked my heart rate resting and it was obviously fast as i was panicking after these pains, but later in school i realised i was quiterelaxed and i measured it and it was 100 roughly resting. sometimes it is irregular i.e pauses in between beats. it is so inconsistent however, i will sometimes feel it and it will be slower like 70 but then the moment i feel it it suddenly speeds up. i also have seemingly constant shortness of breath, even when just sitting. during my walks after school i will be very short of breath. it’s as if i cannot get enough air in with my regular breath ins alone. something to add, i have noticed blue fingernails at the base, not just when it is cold as it happened when i was in the shower. it is as if my body cannot regulate my own temperature because my hands and feet will be absolutely freezing but my legs and arms and torso very warm, and then they’ll swap. i will randomly get hot flushes on my face when doing nothing no embarrassment. i have some weird kind of perpetual cold as mentioned before, runny nose and eyes have gone away since nasal spray, but i have constant phlegm even when i get rid of it like cough it out, sorry for image lol. i am thinking maybe this is a chest infection of some sort? which would explain phlegm, shortness of breath and chest pains and general weird feelings in chest. however this does not take into account my heart rate and my severe right sided headaches.there is a worry at the back of my mind that all of my symptoms are heart related as i have not caredabout my diet and i don’t exercise much except for walking, i am sitting down most of the day. i am worried that my heart is struggling, and the pains in my head are related to it somehow. i am scared i am going to have a stroke or heart attack because of these problems. my question is what to do as i have been to the doctors so much. i hve already told them about my right hand sided headaches just not the new severe ones. i have complained of heart worries in the past and they’ve told me not to worry at my age. i am nervous to go to doctors again because i do not want to take up a slot someone else may need more. i am worried there is nothing wrong and i’m taking it out of proportion. i don’t know if i should maybe talk to NHS 111 but i have heard that they aren’t actually very good. my parents also play a huge role, my dad keeps saying i’m a hypochondriac (which i don’t disagree with lol) but they keep saying that i’m fine and get quite annoyed by me voicing my concerns so i can’t turn to them, i have stopped talking to them about problems. i know i should go to doctors but i’m so unsure about it all now because of the amount of times i’ve been and the amount of times i’ve been sent back with nothing threatening. i have vitamin d deficiency and that’s about it that’s all they found in a blood testthank you so much for reading this it kind of got out of hand lol, if you have any advice please tell me. thank you x x "

Heart Attack,surviving this so young,"I had gotten sick beginning of march 2016, started with shortness of breath, then slowly started progressing, mind you at this time i was smoking meth (never injected) ... My symptoms from march up until i was admitted into the hospital in july 2016 was as followed but not in that exact order: fever up and down, hypothermic levels, shivering, severe hot and cold flashes, headaches, body spasms, pass out spells, tachycardia, intense intermittent chest pain, also dull, intermittent chest pain, heaviness in my chest, like i i drank gallons of water, enlarged spleen pushing my ribs out (it looked like my body was literally turning around), my left side of my body literally sank into the bone, you could just see the outline of my bone, nasty dull and severe left calf cramping sometimes not so bad and other times excruciating charlie horse pain to where i couldnt stand, severe and noticable leg swelling (was in one and both legs) redness of skin on my left side, weird bubbles in random muscles spots (it looked like a huge bulge coming from my muscles at random times) when they disappeared there was like a fluid build up afterwards. I had mottling skin (starting to happen again) I had nasty numbness in my arm and leg (left side), dizzy spells, i lost a TON of weight, barely ate, sweating was on and off, extreme fatigue, nausea, and a few more issues that i cant remember at this given moment... Well i was going to the doctors on and off for months, doctors and the er. The doctors kept telling me it was all in my head, but i knew there was something wrong.... Id hit the floor continuously... I have had anxiety and depression for years so that didnt really help at all... I ended up getting MRSA with nasty lesions all over my body, and i picked at them (ive been picking my skin since i was a child, its called excoriation disorder) so that made it worse, I was on 5 different medications, lotions, and bodywashes and nothing helped... I went to the walk ins with a sore swollen throat (had my tonsils and adnoids taken out when i was 6) They told me it tested negative for strep, well they were wrong. I went to the er i believe within 3 days after that... I had pustules coming out of my skin, nasty ones, i have pictures to prove that... They tested positive for MRSA. Strep A and staph (yeah i know they are basically one in the same, but thats what the doctor had said) So i was admitted quite quickly... The doctors started doing tests and really didnt find anything until they did an echo and a CT scan WITH contrast... They found i had endocarditis, 2 infected vales, 2 calcified valves, a septic nodule with septi satellite nodules in my liver, and a septic pulmonary embolism in my left lung with septic satellite nodules. The bascteria started eating my spine. Messed up my hypothalamus, and almost killed me... I also had systemic invassive Strep A. Stayed a week in the hospital and was put on a PICC line for a month on heavy duty antibiotics... I was healthy for months after that... It has been a full year since my PICC line, and i am started to become sick again, i can feel and see it happening all over again... I had subacute bacterial endocarditis... I knew there was something wrong and the doctors didnt want to listen. I know there is something wrong now, im just scared its the same thing all over again (minus the drug use)... Since having the endocarditis i have had 3 strokes, started having nasty seizures, and ive had a heart attack... I am 24 years old. I cannot stand for more than a maximum of 10 minutes at a times because my heart cannot take it, i still have pass out spells randomly, a hard time breathing, nasty chest pain, heart palpitations, and im fighting disability, not because i want to but unfortunately because i HAVE too... If you feel there is something wrong, then do not hesistate to go to the doctors regardless of what they think... I was told that if i had not gone to the hospital when i did with the pustules, i would have died within MAYBE a week or less... So please, you know your body better than anyone else, if you know or feel there is something wrong, whether they find something or not please go to the doctors! for months the doctors told me they couldnt find anything and that this was all in my head until i was almost dead in their patient room. Do not ever let someone tell you its all in your head... because mine wasnt, mine was real, even after the months of someone telling me it was all in my head...I have been behind in bills for a long time, lost my job, and have been extremely depressed...It feels like its starting to happen again.... I did create a gofundme page for help with bills, but no such luck. And its okay because im still here fighting... I havent given up yet, and dont plant to anytime soon...This is my gofund me page, there may be more information about what happened in there... But after everything that has happened and with the seizures and passout spells my memory is becoming extremely bad...my blog, where ive posted so much about my health... Physical and mental, my recovery and everyday life/thoughts/feelings.Moderator comment: I have removed the link(s) directing to site(s) unsuitable for inclusion in the forums.

Heart Attack,Heart rate increase during the night ,"I've been suffering with worrying heart symptoms over the past few weeks.It's happened three times now and under exactly the same circumstances.I go to the toilet between 2:30 and 4:30am. I come back to the bed and I try to go back to sleep on my right or left l side and I do sometimes feel quite nauseous but I normally do in the night because of acid reflux. Anyway I start feeling a bit uneasy and then start to get hot and sweaty despite the cold room, I get a rush of heat over me. The first time it happened was terrible and I was pacing around trying to get my heart rate to relax, screaming at my partner to call the ambulance. He got me to lay down in the bed and eventually my heart rate came back down to normal (gradually) The last two times, I sit up in bed after I feel weird lying down as I know it's 'coming' and I try to stop it, but I can't and my heart started going fast in my chest again (feels different from doing exercise) I took my pulse using my oximeter last night (third occurance) and it was 150bpm. I layed down as I'm used to the pattern now and it slowly went down as I watched it on the monitor, to 130, 120, 110, 100 and finally about 85. What the hell is going on? It doesn't wake me from sleep and it also doesn't happen during the day either! (Yet!) It happens under no other circumstances other than that I mentioned above about going to the toilet in the night, coming back and it starts after a few minutes of lying down."

Heart Attack,End of life pulmonary oedema care,"My father is 99 and is gradually filling up with fluid due to heart failure.  It started with his lungs, feet and legs, but is now in his upper body in his hands and around his eyes, with leakages appearing. I naively thought the simple answer would be to increase his Furosemide, but successive GPs have requested blood testsand referred him to cardiology (several weeks away). My father is so frail now, barely able to open his eyes or eat and drink, that he just needs to be made comfortable for his final weeks/months. What is the best course of action?"
Heart Attack,Stopping Lacidipine,Has anyone ever suffered from muscle fatigue/weakness whilst on Lacidipine? Has anyone ever managed to stop taking Lacidipine? Has anyone ever managed to stop taking Lacidipine and the muscle weakness clear up?
Heart Attack,"Scary High Heart Rate, Need Answers","It all started about 2 years ago when I was pregnant with my son. One day I started to notice that my heart rate was higher than I felt it should be. At my appointment I spoke to my OB who checked it and said it was 120. She sent me to emergency department where they did an ekg and some blood tests. Nothing showed up aside from the heart rate being elevated. Having been diagnosed with panic disorder 5 years earlier, they assumed it was anxiety and sent me home with the assurance that it would most likely resolve after the baby was born. Fast forward a couple months and after dealing with this all for that long, my new son came into the world. The next morning I woke up and realized my heart rate was only in the 60s. I was so happy! I thought I was on the fast track to getting my life back. However, the happiness didn't last as later that same day I realized I was feeling overly tired and weak, which I attributed to having just given birth without pain relief the day before. I asked the nurse to hook me up to the monitors and when she did my HR was in the 50s. She assured me that this was normal, but by then it wasn't normal for me and it felt strange. A couple days later my fast heart rate returned with a vengeance. After returning home with my newborn I quickly realized that I was developing a pretty severe case of post-partum depression. I wanted nothing to do with my baby, and I felt horrible for feeling that way. I knew he wasn't the problem and that for some reason, my brain was attributing him to all the horrible things I had gone through while I was pregnant. (I had severe morning sickness and lost over 40lbs throughout the pregnancy, landed in the E.R. with severe dehydration several times and became anemic. The HR issue was the icing on the cake.) I knew that I needed help for the things I was going through and sought out a doctor to get myself back on track.During the first few visits with my doctor we discussed all of the things I was experiencing. She felt that a lot of the HR problem could be caused by the depression and anxiety I was dealing with since having my son. She immediately upped my dose of zoloft and added klonopin to help me cope with the panic attacks I was having everytime I tried to hold my baby. My anxiety levels immediately made a drastic change for the better and I was finally able to start really bonding with my son, but it didn't fix the HR problem. A few weeks later she added propranolol to the mix, and soon my heart rate was under control most of the time. She put me on a holter monitor, which came back clean and I now assume this is because I had already begun taking the propranolol. Over the last year, my symptoms have been very up and down. Several months ago the doctor I was seeing moved practices and I was forced to start seeing a new doctor. This doc is not fond of benzos (for good reason) and the first thing she did was stop them. At this point I had been on and off them for about 5 years, so having them ripped away scared me to bits. I didn't end up having withdrawals, but I did end up with my panic attacks back and nothing to help with them at all. At that point the HR issue came back again, but this time the propranolol wasnt working, so she upped the dose. So over the past 6 months or so I have been going through pure agony. Below are the symptoms I've been experiencing.1) High resting HR some days (90-100) and low resting HR other days (50-60).  I feel this could maybe be due to the propranolol working better on some days than others, but for over a year this didn't happen.2) Very high heart rate after eating, resting 110-115 and when standing it shoots to 140-160. Most of the day im ok, until I eat something which is usually only at dinner time and the HR lasts most of the night.3) HR of 120-140 when going from sitting to standing even when I havent eaten recently.4) Skipped beats (PVCs/PACs) when trying to fall asleep, almost never get them unless i am laying down except for the odd one here or there if my HR drops low during the day. Its keeping me up all night, and I can't get any rest.5) Episodes of tachy randomly. It will start to go up quickly and hit somewhere between 150-200bmp lasting anywhere from a few seconds to half an hour. Doc said could be SVT, but it goes down to 120s if I lay down while it's happening. 6) Using a fingertip pulse oximeter I have done some self testing and after noticing that when I yawn, bend over or cough hard my heart feels funny for a minute I decided to watch it for a day and when I do any of those things my HR will plummet from 100s to 80s in a split second. So i held my breath for 10 seconds at which time my HR was at 125, upon holding my breath it dropped to 62 and then slowly crept back up to the low 100s after.7) Severe, debilitating panic attacks that also raise my HR and usually send me to the hospital. So scared that something might be seriously wrong with my heart and want to know other peoples opinions. A little background info below...I am a 27 year old female, about 180lbs (overweight)I have had 2 children, the first pregnancy was uneventful, the second a nightmare.I get migraines, GERD and had my gallbladder removed shortly after the birth of my second child.Currently I am taking propranolol and cymbalta. My maternal grandfather died after several heart attacks due to congestive heart failure and my biological father has coronary artery disease.As for testing i have had 2 holter monitors which showed nothing but sinus tach, and an event monitor for 2 weeks that was clean, but i didnt have any episodes while wearing it. I have had several ekgs and docs say they all look normal.My bp is always under 120/70 and usually closer to 90/50 even before propranolol was started.Been tested for liver, kidney, thyroid, diabetes, electrolytes etc. All clean.Had chest xray done and no sign of enlarged heart.I smoke about a pack a day, no alcohol or street drugs. I have a history or panic attacks and dehydration. "

Heart Attack,Heart problems or anxiety? ,"Hey guys, I have had this problem since I was 7 years old and I am 19 now. For some reason, at times I feel a forced strong heart beat in my throat.  I can be laying down or standing up but once in a while I feel these. I’m assuming it is not life threatening or else I would of been dead by now. It just kinda worries me because I don’t know what causes these. At times this unknown condition of mine brings me down a lot... I have told my doctor about this and my heart is normal according to his examinations. I remember when I was younger I would be terrified when it happened to me, and when I told my mom she said it was all in my head. Honestly I do not think it is imaginary, it even happens when I am not thinking about it. Some are really hard to a point where I flinch a little bit and at times some of them are soft were I barely feel them. When it happens it is not a constant beat it is just one single strong pound. If anyone has experienced this and know what it is please let me know. I feel like this has ruined my life a lot. I don’t know if these are ectopic heart beats or a heart mur mur. Or some kind of heart problem that has not been diagnosed. "
Heart Attack,Rapid heart beats,"I am a 39-year-old woman. For the last 6 months, I have some episodes that are making me worried all the time. I had an echocardiogram, stress test, and had loop monitor for two weeks but nothing was found serious. My doctor told me my heart skips beats and sometimes it has premature beats. I was told that although  I have raising heart beats my heart has a regular rhythm. However, every night when I wake I notice rapid beats on my chest. It stops only when I change my position. Sometimes I feel very light headed for a few seconds and it makes me feel like I am going to fall. In the past, I was near to pass out stage and right after that feeling, I noticed my heart raised fast for a few minutes. I am worried that I have something else that is not detected yet. My concern is that I need further tests to figure out my underlying problems. Please advise. Thank you"

Heart Attack,Struggling with finding a doctor who will carefully look at my medical history&me as a whole person,"47 yo female.

Learned today I have wide QRS complex (LBBB) and it's been showing up that way on EKG for many years, prior to ever having pacer and still now.

Coughing also caused pain in my chest.  About an hour after taking the second dose, I stood up I  felt like I was going to faint and then all of a sudden, I’m just violently sick.  Prior to this, I did feel a dull  tightness around my heart which is still there.

Heart Attack,"Frequent heart palpitations, feeling lightheaded...","Hi all, I'm new here and was hoping for some advice.About a week ago I had a very strong heart palpitation, like three or four VERY strong beats which then made me feel extremely lightheaded and as if I was going to faint, which I didn't.  After a couple of hours I felt ok again, but then since that evening I have had this weird fluttery, palpitation like feeling almost constantly.  Even as I am sitting here now I have felt a few skipped beats which make me feel weak and a bit lightheaded.  I went to the Doctors last Friday, they did an ECG which all came back as normal however during this I didn't experience any palpitations or the like, so I am wondering how much this can trusted to detect an arrhythmia? I have been booked in for a blood test on Thursday to check for Anaemia, Overactive Thyroid, amongst other things I would imagine.  This has been pretty much a constant thing for over a week now and there is nothing particular that is setting it off.  I vape, which I stopped but this had no effect on this feeling I am having, I am not stressed out and this certainly doesn't feel to me like anxiety - I have through my life obviously felt anxious at stages and this is not that feeling; it feels like my heart is beating very fast but my pulse seems to be normal.  I also feel it at the base of the neck/throat, like a lump.  Like I want to take a really deep breath, but that doesn't even help.Any advice would be greatly appreciated, and than you in advance for your help  Sophie."

Heart Attack,"Please help!!! TOF repair in 1986, pulmonary valve replacement?","Im a 30 year old male, had a TOF repair in 1986. LPA Stent at age 15. Ive been symptom free for the most part, except when I run a lot then I do get a bit of SOB. But other than that Ive been symptom free. I went into a Cardio consult, and based on my EKG and ECHO, they said I need to get a open heart surgery for my pulmonary valve replacement because I have RV hypertrophy. I thought most docs would take into consideration of symptoms, my possible weight gain (to counteract the load on my heart), and other factors before going to surgery. I literally met this cardiologist for the first time, and without even auscultating me, he suggessted open heart surgery. Not sure what to make of it. My folks who did my initial TOF repair did an ECHO every year, and the last one was done 3 years ago. MY primary care doc compared the ECHO reports and basically stated that yeh you do have Pul HTN but nothing that you havent had before and you are  not showing symptoms of anything. I am not sure what to make of it? It seems the cardiologist was hell bent on getting the surgery done, as he had everything lined up, the interventionalist (cardio), the surgeon and himself, so I feel like maybe it was a catch and bait of some sorts? Your thoughts?"
Heart Attack,Concentration Issues at School ,"my child is 12½ and had corrective surgery at 1½.  He has been told he will be getting a valve replacement sometime and was just recently told to come back for a check up in 2 years.    (usually we have check ups yearly) re schooling - we have always had issues with him following tasks/concentration and carrying out homework tasks, he seems to lack the ability to follow it through.  he is bright but just doesn't seem to be able to apply himself to the best of his ability.  Has anyone else noticed any issues at school?   I have raised concerns since he was 5 but just get fobbed off by doctors and education authorities.  thanks in advance. "

Heart Attack,Slow Heart Rate?,"All my life I have problems with anxiety and panic attacks, also I have fast heart beats and high blood pressure. 7 days ago I quit smoking after 4 years of active smoking (2 packs a day) and now I can `t believe it all day I have lower heart beats (50-60 bpm), and when I lay down for sleeping my heart beats fall down to 45 bpm. I start to fear that I have AV blocks in my heart conduction system  I fell a little dizziness and breast pain but I think that is from my anxiety, because I felt that earlier. When I workout my heart beat faster, for example just walking is enough to my heart beat 90 bpm, after 10 squats my heart beat 120 bpm etc. Year ago I was at cardiologist because fast heart beating, I do ECG, 24h ECG and ultrasound of my heart and he said that my heart is perfect. How and my blood pressure is fine 120/70. Do you have any advice? Do I need to visit my doctor? Or to start smoking again xD Thanks for answers and really sorry for bad English "

Heart Attack,Cardiac Catheterzation ,"Hello I had a stress test 2 weeks ago and when I went for the results I was told there’s a spot that looks questionable ... since I’m over 40 ( 43 ) and diabetic it’s recommended I get a heart cath.   I also suffer from extreme health anxiety so hearing this basically sent me over the edge. My cardiac cath  isn’t for another two weeks, and I am absolutely petrified that something is going to happen to me between now and then. My anxiety is through the roof I have all the classic symptoms of anxiety that I have suffered with for over 16 years but now I’m convinced it’s my heart.    I’m trying to tell myself that if they were overly concerned they would schedule me sooner than making me wait two weeks "
Heart Attack,What could it be?,"Hi. I have been having some heart palpitations, hyperventilating etc since January of this year. All signs linked to blocked arteries (angina) so I had an Angiography which came back clear. I have been getting bad kidney pains along side all of the other symptoms but since the angiography the pain has been so severe.With the angiography coming back clear, what else could this issue be? I have been getting bad kidney pains alongside all the other symptoms and they have been more severe since the angiography. I went and had a urine test yesterday which came back as clear so not sure about it being kidneys. My blood tests prior to angiography all came back clear also.I have used drugs in the past which may have caused a problem.Any help gratefully appreciated."
Heart Attack,"undiagnosed ""keep suggesting anxiety"" resting heart rate has increased HELP!!!","Hi,I was hesitant to throw my business out there; however, I hope that maybe someone with similar issues could point me into the right direction. Back in May 2017, I was at Michaels doing some arts and crafts with the family, I had a sharp pain (which I know doesn't indicate heart pain) and begun to feel very dizzy and sick.  I went to an Urgent Care style facility and my BP was 214/105.  They sent me to the Emergency Room, did the D-dimer test, cardiac enzyme test, CBC, Liver, etc.  Everything, including the EKG came back normal.  Well, after that, my BP went back to normal, but a week later I had another spike.  Time went on, and I had numbness and tingling in my left arm and hands.  It worked its way up to my jaw and neck.  I have had a CT scan of my brain, several X-rays of my chest, an MRI of my brain and c-spine, Stress Test, Heart Echo, Stress Echo, Sleep Study, and even a 48 hour holter monitor.  The holter monitor showed only 1 PVC our of 186,000 heart beats.  No PACs.  My heart and the valves work beautifully.  They suggest that I go to a psychiatrist, so I did.  I have gone to two for different opinions.  They said I do not have anxiety.  I don't think I do either, other than from these undiagnosed problems.  I have had chest tightness for a two months now.  Whenever I stand up and start to walk it gets tight on the right side of my sternum, often in between the sternum and my clavical, and occasionally in my throat.  My BP has been anywhere from 105/42 to 160/96 in the past two months.  Yesterday I went to the cardiologist.  My resting HR was 95 (normally it is in the 50s) and my BP was 156/92.  Two hours later at my internist appointment, my BP was 132/85, then right before I left they retook it and it was 110/75.  My heart rate this morning when I checked it after I parked my care was 110 (resting).  It has been between 79 and 110 resting today.  It got up to 136 when I was casually walking, and I am certain that it still is, but I have given up.  Since May, I have had a variety of symptoms and changes.  I have had the tightness in my chest (as described above), and pinching in my scapula, pain in my arms, numbness in my arms, neck, jaw, and face, and even burning in my left calf. Yes, its a lot.  These issues have caused anxiety in my opinion, but like I said, bot mental health docs said that I don't have anxiety.  They said I just seem to be very stressed out from the unknown.  Also, I went to an orthopedic surgeon and he said this isn't related to my previous injuries.  I do have a brain injury, should injuries / repairs, degeneration in my lumbar, sacrum damage, meniscus tear (left knee), plantar fasciitis, and other injuries.  He believes they are all unrelated to the unexplained chest tightness, crazy BP, and abnormal heart rate. Any thoughts or recommendations?  Just two weeks ago my heart rate was normal in the 50's...Something has changed, and the doctors are only suggesting stress and anxiety.  I call BS on it. Thanks!Best Regards,petdio"

Heart Attack,How to tell the difference between heart palpitations and a heart attack?,"My mother had stage 4 pancreatic cancer, but died from a heart attack. I have always had heart palpitations since i was a teen. i was diagnosed with tachycardia years ago.i dont have insurance, but i did have ekg a few times over the years. my heart has always come back normal. but its been a few years now.the palpitations dont really cause my heart rate to spike, it stays in the 70s but i feel my heart skip beats, or accelerate a bit.ever since my mother passed, when i get heart palpitations i start to panic, i feel faint, get heart burn,  and start imagining pain in my arms. the thing is that i get palpitations from coffee or overeating. overeating causes gives me heartburn. the faint feeling starts when i start breathing, as i read that it helps to make the palpitations to go away.i used to get it and not care, but since my mother passed away, i feel like my stress is making the symptoms worse.how can i know if i am truly having a heart attack? im only 33 but ive heard of people having it young, i am also overweight."

Heart Attack,Was my adverse drug reaction due to my Borderline or Prolonged QT interval?,"Drug Induced Long QT Syndrome (LQTS)Long QT Syndrome ( LQTS) is a congenital electrical impairment of the heart, affecting about in one in 3000 people, which may present itself in up to 13 variants each having its own signature of morbidity (i.e. the way in which those with LQTS will probably die). It may not be observable in any mechanical investigations of the heart and a diagnosis can only be verified by genetic analysis with familial consent.However, there are implications for people who may not be diagnosed as having LQTS but who have Borderline or Prolonged QT intervals, putting them at greater risk of cardiac events from certain classes of drugs that actually prolong their QT interval and mimic the effects of having LQTS. This is called Drug Induced Long QT Syndrome.Since 2005, the FDA and European regulators have required that nearly all new drugs should be evaluated in what is called a Thorough QT (TQT) study to determine the drug’s influence on cardiac arrhythmias that can possibly lead to a fatal outcome.Here is a table of QT intervals based on a heart rate of 60 beats per minute (QTc) in the absence of: drugs, electrolyte imbalance, ischemia and diurnal influences:                                                Male (HR=60 bps)      Female (HR=60 bps)Short QT                                 330 to 360 ms                  340 to 370 msNormal  QT                             360 to 430 ms                    370 to 450 msBorderline  QT                       430 to 450 ms                     450 to 470 msProlonged QT                         450 to 500 ms                    470 to 510  msLong QT Syndrome                 390 to 600+ ms                 400 to 600+ msThis is an extended table based on European regulatory guidelines for QTc prolongation.In view of these TQT drug evaluations, ways of improving the accuracy and interpretation of ECG waveforms with respect to manual reading and/or automated methods are in progress to minimise the occurrence of adverse drug reactions.The question now arises as to the safety of drugs that pre-date the TQT evaluation requirements of 2005.Any Comments? "
Heart Attack,"Shortness of breath, fatigue, weak for months no clear diagnosis","At this point, I'm wondering if I am risking heart attack or passing out by pushing myself to exercise a little, walk a little, have more physical activity because I am wasting away.  Can anyone tell me if this is connected with cardiovascular disease do do I need to worry everytime I get short of breath?   Just making a sandwich or walking to 711 and back can do it.I also had a diagnosis of Hiatal Hernia about 7 months ago and fell on my but fracturing 3 vertebrate.  I have also been using prednisone for over five years for a skin condition. After the fall, I suffered a multitude of painful symptoms, back pains, then abdominal/g.i. track pains, and bloating all the time like a hard basketball whether I ate or not. Excruciating days and nights, move this way the back stabs, try to lie down the stomach screams.    I spent the next 7 months and all my savings with many doctors and hospitals and nothing has changed much, instead a couple of months ago the most serious symptoms arose; the shortness of breath, weakness, and fatigue.Doctors kept giving me laxitives and saying the hernia has no affect on anything.   I had a full heart testing done saying heart is fine, but second opinions showed not.  I was not given a treadmill test.   A heart ctscan for calcium showed lots and I was advised to get an angiogram but haven't the money for that now.Also, the many doctors not talking to each other resulted in many different medications probably causing problems.I have just about given up and resigned to die but thought I would try some more research in forums like these.  Thank you. "
Heart Attack,"No doctor can tell me what is wrong, just want answers!","I am 28 years old, I have been dealing with these issues since I was 21.

Heart Attack,Boney growths on sternum after surgery,I had my aortic valve replaced in May 2012. From the start I have felt a sharp piece of wire just under the skin in a couple of places. Later I could feel several bony spurs on my sternum.They have become bigger with time and although not actually painful unless touched I am aware of them and around them itches. Just buttoning my shirt is enough to be aware of them and if my wife's arm goes over my chest in bed it is painful.  Anyone else have them and how much did they grow or cause a problem. Googling also suggests that they could be calcium deposits.I had my aortic valve replaced in May 2012. From the start I have felt a sharp piece of wire just under the skin in a couple of places.

Heart Attack,scared,"So I have to admit I am a bit scared which obviously isn't helping matters. The doctor told me yesterday that I had ectopic beats and has referred me to the hospital for a 24hr monitor. They started last week and some days are better than others. One of the main issues is that we were supposed to be flying to America in four weeks to visit friends and if course this has made me even more anxious, thinking that they wont let me go. Has anyone got any tips on how to stop these damn things. Will they go away on their own? I had a really good day yesterday but this morning is not so good. So I have to admit I am a bit scared which obviously isn't helping matters.

Heart Attack,Ongoing heart issues.. getting really bad,"Hey guys, I developed palpitations quite badly at a young age and after years of tests (24 hr tape, 48hr tape, 7 day tape, treadmill tests, echo, a million ecgs! Tilt table test) etc. They finally realised that I have a fast heartbeat, arrhythmia and something called pots syndrome. I have been suffering recently with the WORST palpitations and today ended up in a&e with servere indigestion. The ruled out heart attack (thank god) but im not so convinced.. tried taking heartbrun and indigestion tablets but not even touching  it. Never had this before and its getting worse.. im a 21 hr old female and otherwise healthy. What is wrong with me!!!"
Heart Attack,Right ventricular hypertrophy,"Hello!My son has 19 y.o. and was diagnosed with right ventricular hypertrophy.His doctor told him that this condition is due to the fact that  since he was 16 y. o. he had been lifting weights intensively and there is nothing to worry about.The physician prescribed him Mg and B6 vitamin.Frankly speaking, me and my son still worry a lot and we are not sure if the physician was reading the EKG aprropriately.This is the photo of an EKG. Could you help us figure out if it's something unusual with this EKG? I know my report is oversimplified, but I would appreciate a lot to know other opinion on this EKG as well .http://imgur.com/LF6iGUUThank you!"
Heart Attack,Worried about Pericarditis...," 21 female.About 3 months ago, I was diagnosed with Pericarditis. I was prescribed Ibuprofen and eventually colchicine. Weeks passed (I'm sorry, I'm very bad at keeping track of time) and I got an echocardiogram. The cardiologist told me that the pericarditis was gone, I can stop taking the medication, and that I'm safe to return to work (I'm a cashier).Back to work and the pain came back. Chest pain, pain in the collar bone, left arm pain, pain in the left side of neck/jaw, shoulder blade pain (as well as in between), dizzy spells, nausea, migraine/headache, low-grade fever. This would wake me up at night as well. And lately, my pain has been localized in my shoulders. It got so bad that I went back to the ER (and I've been in the ER so many times these passed 3 months). After another round of EKGs, chest xrays, blood work, and echos, the doctor told me that my pericarditis has returned and I am to resume my previous treatment.And so, back to ibuprofen and colchicine. But it doesn't seem to be working this time around. The pain and everything else persists. I think I've been getting palpitations too, like my heart feels like it's bouncing around or something. It just feels... weird.I'm very worried that maybe there's something else going on. It's been months now and nothing seems to be resolving. And my upper back pain is really concerning me... I've heard that this could mean a warning sign for a heart attack, especially in young women. I guess the good thing about all of this is that I have absolutely no troubles with breathing. But... I'm scared, honestly.The nurses at the ER are confident in my otherwise very healthy heart since there's no family history of heart attacks or anything else, and all tests so far have checked out just fine (just the slightly elevated troponin and anemia, but neither spells emergency and troponin level is related to pericarditis). But I'm not satisfied at all. I can't help but think all of this are just warning signs and that I'll just drop dead or never wake up sleep. Or that maybe I've had a heart attack before and this is the result of it.But what a small effusion I have. It's like... 2-4mL or something. Very small. Not constricting in the least. And I find is appalling that it's causing THIS much pain. They also tell me that it looks like it's improving. Well... it doesn't feel like it is at all.I've been feeling very lost. I also have anxiety and depression issues. I've spent most of my days isolated in my room, waiting for the worst to come. I've felt emotionally disconnected from everyone and everything around me.I'm simply freaked out. I have an appointment with my cardiologist in a week, but with each passing day, I wonder if I'm ever going to make it. Right now, my shoulder blades are burning. The pain is continuous, sleeping only helps.There's a heart hospital that I want to go to and I might go to today. Has anybody had pericarditis like this? It just feels waaaay to similar to a potential heart attack. And it never lets up.And sorry if this sounds like a jumbled piece of mess. I didn't get much sleep last night. 21 female.About 3 months ago, I was diagnosed with Pericarditis. I was prescribed Ibuprofen and eventually colchicine.

Heart Attack,Amlodipine and Erection difficulty ,"Hi I am 39 year Old. I have recently diagnosed with high blood pressure. So my GP put me on Amlodipine 5mg. I am diabetic type 2 as well and taking Metformine 500 mg for that. Now after being on this two medications I am experiencing some erection problems. I can always obtain an erection but recently can't maintain that when try to have sex. I am loosing my election right inside vagina which is utterly frustrating for both of us.I have already got long time premature ejaculation problem on top I am facing this Erection problem. My sex life now almost non existent. Frustration is at sky high between us two. I studied online some people said amolodipine cause some kind of erection difficulty but with careful further study I got to know Amlodipine is calcium blocker drug so it is actually less likely to be responsible for erectile dysfunction. I find it too embarrassing to get myself checked by GP.  Besides if once I change the Amlodipine if the new one make it worse how would I know.Do any of you have similar conditions please let me know your advice Thanks  Report this? 0"

Heart Attack,For the past week my heart rate has been well into the hundreds while i'm at rest.,"I'm 16 .  I wake up one morning about a week ago and my heart rate is 130 for no reason. It caught my attention because I could hear it thumping in my ears it was pounding so hard.  It hasn't gone under 100 since. It's gotten up to 170. I haven't been doing exercise or anything to make it that high. I'll be sitting down and start breathing heavy like I just ran a mile but I'm sitting down. I've been very light headed and nearly pass out every time I stand up too fast or bend over. I feel like i'm running a fever yet my fingers and toes are freezing. I've started to see dark veins in my hands and feet and legs that were never there before. When I press a finger against my skin it takes a good 10-15 sec for the color to come back.I try to and take it easy because when I stand my heart beats faster and I feel short of breath. after standing for long(ish) periods of time(30-45min) the lower part of my legs look bruised, with black and blue and will ache slightly. but I'll sit down and it'll go away in like 5 min. I've never had anything like this happen to me before and there aren't any heart problems in the family. Does anybody think this is worth discussing with my doctor, she tends not to take me seriously but I feel exhausted for no reason and these are very peculiar symptoms to me. What should I ask her about? I'm not entirely sure if it's cardiovascular related but since my heart feels like its going to beat out of my chest I thought I'd ask.

Heart Attack,Long term outlook,"I have only recently found out (4 series ago)that I had Tof when I was born in 1956.The operation was in 1972 age 7 years. It now looks like I was one of the first people to have the surgery as it was only about then they had the echo units sorted to see what was going onI livde with it till then. Couldn't get up a flight of stairs.Mum pushed me to school in a buggy. Boy did I have a tuff time trying to get a girl friend at primary schoolNow at 51 having a few problems and have to have a pacemaker fitted next week. Nothing to do with a Tof. Just ...these things happen.I have had a cracking life. Sailed round the world. Captained large private yachts. Diving holidays, played in local rock bands.So what I'm trying to say is apart from ""Hello"".This is a tough time for many of you, but it doesn't mean your little ones are going to be held back in life, that's entirely up to you as parents.The ONLY thing my mother was advised was that I shouldn't play contact sports. I have had my ears pierced, I drank, yes I smoked for a while and lived life to the full. This operation is not the end, it is the begining. Please keep your heads up and keep faith in the doctors and specialists. They know how to do this. I was test case and am still here with my own child and I wouldn't change a thing.I'm a Tof kid and PROUD of itKim"

Heart Attack,Chest tightness and pain in chest help,"HelloNeed some help. I have been suffering with chest tightness like someone is sitting on my chest and I'm not getting any oxygen.  I also get pain with it than it travels to my back. I am a 37 year old female. I have done ecg, stresstest, echocardiogram and all is normal.  I'm not convinced. I keep thinking it's my heart. Anyone else feel what I feel ? What are the chances it is my heart "
Heart Attack,Angiogram,"My husband had an angiogram last week and his vessels were almost clear, with a tiny bit of thickening just in one artery, with no treatment required. He continues to have minor chest pain whilst at rest and under stress so has been referred for an MRI heart scan. Wonder why this is being done after the 'gold standard' angiogram? There's a long wait for MRI heart scan so wondering about having it done privately. Wonder if this is permitted?9 week wait on NHS. I know they don't like patients mixing NHS / private treatment, but don't think they can stop you?  Anyone done this? My husband had an angiogram last week and his vessels were almost clear, with a tiny bit of thickening just in one artery, with no treatment required.

Heart Attack,Heart failure. ,"Having had an echo cardiogram last week I was told I have ""heart failure "". Been prescribed beta blocker and anticoagulant,  was already taking an ace inhibitor. My pulse rate has come down from 120/130 to nrmal 60 but still very irregular. I have been referred to a cardiologist, awaiting an appointment. Any advice  on  lifestyle changes etc appreciated. "
Heart Attack,"Holter reports average heartrate 60, total beats 84354","Hello, sorry this is a long ramble.  I went to the doctor because of low body temperature which is always around 35.4 in the mornings and 36.0 in the late afternoons, and slow resting heartrate, which is 44 to 55.  I figured all this was due to my Hashimotos hypothyroidism.   I have had occasional events of near-fainting sensation (always while sitting still and relaxed).  This has been when my resting HR has been in the 40s. My blood pressure is in the low range of normal, except when I get really stressed, then it shoots up. I have had this problem for a few years now, along with fatigue and fibromyalgia. I am otherwise healthy, take no meds except thyroxine and paracetamol, not overweight, no alcohol and eat well.Because my thyroid function tests are all normal, doc said it isnt my thyroid, and dismissed my report of low body temp completely.  But he referred me for a 24hr holter monitor.  I seem to have a default setting of 60 bpm for normal activity, ie walking around, pottering about the house etc.  The Holter result  says  that my average HR over 24hrs was 60, max 109 (during very strenuous exercise) and low of 40 (while asleep). Standing alone, all those numbers look fairly normal, from what I can find out on the net.  But would the monitor show how often my HR is well below 60, as I know it often is, but I don't think the doctors believe me!  In the doctors rooms if they take my pulse, it is always around 70, as I am so wound up and stressed.  I am not an athlete, I am 63yrs old and not fit but  I take a moderately paced walk every day, 20 to 30 minutes and try to be as active as I can generally.  For the benefit of the monitor, on that day I took a very fast 20 minute walk (just short of a jog!), which is when the 109 bpm was recorded.  Normally I would not ever have a HR of 109. It's all a bit weird, because before this slow stuff all started, about 5 years ago, I used to have a fast/normal HR, and as I have generalised anxiety disorder, I am used to worrying about a fast HR, not a slow one!  About 10 years ago I used to get supraventricular tachycardia sometimes. It went away and never came back. I now get occasional palps, that come in bouts. The holter identified them as PACs including some couplets.  The day of the recording I only had a couple, but some days I have dozens.  I put them down to anxiety, and I try not to eat or do anything that sets them off, as they scare me, even though I know they are (apparantly) OK.So I guess my question is, is 84354 beats in 24hrs a bit 'slow' or 'normal'?  Is bradycardia when you have under 60 bpm all the time or just some of the time? Do they diagnose brady on the calculated average HR over 24hrs, or on noted HRs under 60bmp ?   I have not had a followup with the hospital doctor yet and have not seen the final report, just what the technician told me when she took the monitor off and checked it.  She said there was a lot of artifact on the recording but I have not been asked to repeat the test.Thanks for reading  "
Heart Attack,Palpitating and more..,"I've been palpitating for almost a week now and have been diagnosed by my doc. having a high blood pressure this year. I have to maintain a medicine to control my blood pressure. Last May my left rib cage was so very painful and it lasted 15- 30 mins and suddenly goes away. Last December of 2016 I had ECG but went back normal and recently I had another ECG and Chest x ray also went back normal. The Doc. just gave me pain killers for the chest pains.Its kinda alarming on my part since I am only 28 years old and it gives me head ache to think what might be the reason why I'm experiencing all of these. There are times that my upper left chest feels so tight and painful but not to painful, sometimes in the right side. But never in the center of the chest.  My left arm feels tired and it feels like something is stabbing me in the left part of my rib cage near the armphit. I searched those symptoms in google and found out that it may be related to heart problems, anxiety disorder, acid reflux and so on and so forth.I'm so scared and don't know what to do. But I'm doing my best to control those palpitations and I've succeeded. Maybe its all in the mind? What do you think? I'm so clueless right now. "

Heart Attack,Heart disease progression,"Hi, I was diagnosed with a moderate mid LAD lesion a year ago and put on medication. My angiogram showed this as the only area of disease. The lesion progressed and 10 weeks ago I had a stent fitted with an excellent result. During my follow up with the cardiologist he told my that I have other areas of plaque but they have not progressed in the last year. However my latest angiogram shows another 2 mild blockages and I believe this shows rapid progression. I can't understand the discrepancy unless the 2 minor blockages were missed of the fist angiogram. Thoughts please?Hi, I was diagnosed with a moderate mid LAD lesion a year ago and put on medication.

Heart Attack,Just diagnosed mitral valve leak. Worried. 34. ,"Hi all. I'm 34 and towards the end of last year I began having really strange heart palpitations/thumping that would wake me up. My mum had heart surgery to repair her mitral valve years ago and was told it was anxiety all her life unto it got so severe so she was adimant about me getting this checked out. My echo came back as a minor leak. And my 24 hour monitor I had done showed a normal heart rate:beat during that 24 hour period. I am to be monitored now. My next echo is in 3 years. I spoke to my GP about exercise etc and keeping healthy etc. But I'm still left a bit stressed and anxious. Just decided to join here. Wondered if anyone else is in my shoes and what their outcome is or what they do. What should I be doing. Will it get worse ?Gp said their is no knowing of that. That it could just stay the same. I think the un certainty is driving me a bit mad and I'm not sure I could go through what my mum did. "
Heart Attack,"Chest pain, should i return to work?","Three days ago i was admitted to A&E by ambulance with chest pains similar to heart burn, pain in the left side of my ribs, shortness of breath and pins and needles in my left arm. Im 42 years old, non smoker and in generally good health.ECG, chest xray and bloods all came back normal, however i was told i must see a cardiologist within a week as i may have Pericarditis. I was not given any further advice and have been home resting since. The pains come on and off during the day, but arent quite as bad as they were and when i saw my GP she said it was nothing to worry about and sent me home, again with little or no firm advice.I generally feel ok other than the tightness and pins and needles coming on and off.I work in an office, with little manual labour, but have over an hours commute by road to and from work. Am i able to return to work, or should i rest at home until I have seen the cardiologist which is not for another week?Should i be taking aspirin to help?Any help, thoughts or advice from people who have experience something similar would be much appreictaed."
Heart Attack,Worried about chest pain and chest tightness,"Hi guys, my biggest fear is getting a heart attack. Every pain around my chest will make me worry. I had 3 ECG and 1 stress test done 6 months ago and everything came back fine. My chest starts to feel pain and tight on and off for about a week. Sometimes my face and neck will turn red suddenly and disappear within seconds. Also, whenever I stand, I cant breathe properly which gave me tight chest. Can someone please reassure me!"
Heart Attack,Normal EKG but still heart thumps/palpitations ,Well as by the title you can see I went to get an EKG and it came back normal but im still having heart palpitations. Basically the nurse told me it's more than likely due to stress. Well I haven't been getting that much rest lately and I work with dogs and I constantly have to keep yelling and correcting them and I don't get enough sleep. I'm also diabetic but my A1C is excellent. Idk It's like I started having heart palpitations after I found out I was diabetic at 13 and I kept diagonosing myself with things and I also was recently diagnosed with GERD. But these palpitations happen out of nowhere and I can feel them in my left arm and it twitches (idk if it's a muscle spasm or not ) but also sometimes when I'm jumping around doing things underneath my breast itt aches for a bit and my left arm feels weird but then I relax myself and it stops. Please help I'm soooo scared I think my Ekg didn't pick something up or I'm just being scared but with physicals wouldn't my doctors pick something up with blood work and listening to my heart?

Heart Attack,CAD or something else?,"Six weeks ago, my husband had chest pains and was taken to the emergency room. There they did ECGs and blood tests over a period of 18 hours, but nothing abnormal was detected. He was discharged home and told that he would require a heart stress test. My husband has type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and cholesterol. All these conditions are well controlled with medication and he has lost 2 stone and has been told that he is now classed as non diabetic. He exercises regularly, has never smoked but there is a family history of heart disease.Two weeks ago he went for the stress test, but they did an ecg first and refused to carry out the test as there was a concern about the T waves. Not sure what this could mean. We saw a cardiologist last week. He said we could go through stress test and echocardiogram but ultimately, he felt it best to go straight through an angiogram, describing it as the gold standard. He said this would be better than a CT angiogram,It is now 6 weeks since his chest pains and he has had no pains or discomfort since. There has been absolutely no signs of angina on exertion and my husband has been carrying on doing workouts since, with no ill effect,My question is, would he have experienced heart pain since, if he has Coronary artery disease? Seems strange that he has had no chest pain, no breathlessness whatsoever. Is a lack of symptoms normal in CAD. Just hoping it was a virus or pulled muscle in his chest. Incidentally, he also has asthma, for which he uses a brown/ blue inhaler.Your thoughts would be appreciated. His angiogram is only 2 weeks off, but it seems like an eternity.Many thanks! "

Heart Attack,furrows(indents) in veins,"Hi, I am having systemic symptoms. Has been going on for about three months... Most symptoms come and go.. I think I have a lot going on..    My question here is does anyone here have  furrowing of the veins.. It happens when I raise my arms or legs above my heart... I have been having a pulse of over 100(sometimes 130)  very often.. It is normal a lot too... My head has a pulse at times too with eye pain..  It seems to be a lump on back where pulses(this is on left side) Vibrates too.. I get this humming in my left foot also that has a tempo that comes and goes.. Blood pressure is usually normal only slightly elevated at times, 130/80 sometimes..     Had xray chest clear, ct head no contrast clear, all blood work came back normal ( neutrophils 78% but total white count is normal) .. I did have positive test for h.pylori which explained my gerd symptoms but I don't think it's the root of my issue.. Blood culture OK, no lymes. Cortisol OK.

Heart Attack,Heart Concerns,"Hi During a hot spell three weeks ago, my husband came home from work with chest pains, in his neck throat and shoulder. I decided to take him to A and E. where they did 3 ECG and blood tests over several hours with nothing abnormal detected. They kept him in overnight and retested in the morning, but once again NAD. The doctor informed that he would require s stress test. Once home he felt breathless for a while, but returned to work 2 days later with no ill effects. Since then he's been carrying on as normal. He does have type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol which are all controlled with medication.Yesterday, he went for a stress test, doing an ecg before they commenced. When this was done, they refused to do the stress test as an abnormality was spotted. He has now been referred to the cardiologist for tests.Just wonder what the wait will be like? Will this be classed as urgent.We have a holiday booked abroad in 3 weeks so unsure whether to cancel. Should we pay to see a consultant privately and how soon could this happen? He has no symptoms even on exertion. Are ECGs always accurate?Many thanks"

Heart Attack,Need advice/Help,"My dad had a triple bypass 10 months ago. Ever since he has been in constant pain.

This is done 5 - 6 days per week. Their blood pressure constantly reads at ~160/80 mm/Hg. Sometimes even spiking higher in the 170-180 range, although the diastolic never goes above 90. Also the individual is 31 years old and their mother was Type 1 Diabetic with congential heart disease which came from her fathers side. All other family members are without heart issues and all grandparents aside from the Mothers father lived past 85 and/or are still alive. Their diet may be too high in sodium, however I've been reading this is less of a concern than it use to be. They do drink quite heavily on the weekends. As in 8+ drinks on a Friday and/or Saturday night. However there is no alochol consumption during the week.Has anyone here seen similar situaitons? Maybe this could be due to stress or need for a higher dose of a specific nuterients? Any experience or suggestions are welcome. Thanks. PS I have googled this subject and I get non-stop lists of the typical suggestions talking about eating right, losing weight, exercise regularly, ect ect. However this is clearly an atypical situation. "

Heart Attack,Prolonged qt interval on an ekg ,"Hey guys, My anxiety is getting the best out of me lately. I started experiencing anxiety 4 months ago. With the advice of my psychologist I went and had blood work done, ek, etc just to rule out health problems. Everything checked out fine. The 2 ekgs I had were in April. The first one was fine. I was given another ekg 2 weeks later and when my doctor walked into the room he asked if I was in any meds, I said no. When I asked why he said the qt interval was a little long. He went back and compared it to m other ekg and walked back in the room and said he wasn't worried and that my heart was perfectly healthy. I haven't been able to get that out of my head. I have since been back to my doctor twice to ask him about the ekg results and he reassured me both times that my heart was perfectly healthy and that I would be wasting my money if I did anymore testing. He said I didn't have LQTS. He only noticed it because my qtc interval on the 2nd ekg was longer than my first. I am 31 years old. I have never had issues exercising, going on rides, etc. I have fainted 3 times in my life twice because I was in a hospital and I can't handle hospitals and blood and once because I was not feeling well and hadn't eaten. The most recent faint was in a local hospital and I had an ekg done within the hour and it was.  Do I leave it alone or investigate it further? I am freaking out! "

Heart Attack,Is there any point now?,"I woke up last night, shortly after falling asleep with the most painful feeling of burning pressure in my chest and throat. I've had pain from heartburn before, but this eclipsed those episodes by miles! The ""rise and fall"" feeling of this occurred rapidly, about 30 seconds to a minute or so apart. It made it extremely difficult to take a full breath and wouldn't ease up...at all. Only after 4 Tums and a dose of Pepto did they dull enough for me to go back to sleep.Initially, the thought 'Am I having a heart attack?' Went through my mind, but then I decided that couldn't be it. It MUST be indigestion or acid reflux. Even though I've never had any indication EVER before of GURD. In the interest of full disclosure, while I didn't eat anything yesterday that would likely cause heartburn, I did enjoy a handful of beers. I'm not a heavy drinker, and even though it probably doesn't mean squat, I've not had any problems with regards to gas, reflux or the like when I've imbibed before. Also, I smoke which increases the chance of problems, I know. Finally, I'm 46, and cardiac problems are present through my father and paternal grandmother.So, this morning, I can't stop thinking over and over of my initial question and deciding I may have very well had a heart attack, or signs of one coming, maybe? If that is even possible. I still don't feel well; I'm feeling fatigued and just ""bleh"". Honestly, it kind of feels like remnants of last night's symptoms are still present.So my question now is this: is there any point now in going to urgent care? Or should I wait to make an appointment with my doctor and just go see her?"
Heart Attack,Nuclear Stress Test,"I had a Nuclear Stress test last week for ongoing heart problems. I am bradycardic and the injection given to speed up my heart only managed to get to 73bpm and I had horrendous chest and left arm pain.

Heart Attack,Shortness of Breath and Heart palpitations.,"It started when I was on my way to school and suddenly my heart started racing and it was fluttering.

Heart Attack,Irregular inter-cardiac cycle periods. What's wrong?,"During exertion my heartbeat tends to go:lub-dub (short pause) lub-dub (long pause) lub-dub....It is definitely irregular, and I am positive I am timing/counting cycles, not systoles/diastoles. What could be wrong?I am 15, very fit (if I may say so myself), I eat healthy, but the past two weeks I have been eating less, cutting for summer. More elaborately, for if it helps:Breakfast: 55g of oatmeal with milk, fruits, medium portion of baked tomato beans. (440 kcal)No lunchSnack: 1 quesadilla, fruits/veggies, 1 or 2 plain rice crackers (260 kcal) Dinner: Very large portion of rice with chili con carne, fruits/veggies. (750 kcal)It adds up to about 1440 calories, but before you assume an eating disorder, note that I had little to no exertion that day. All I did was bike moderately to the gym (3.5 km) do a really underwhelming workout, and bike back.So in short: 15 yrs, fit, male, 1440 kcal.  "
Heart Attack,Myocarditis ,"I'm a 20 year old male that has recently been diagnosed with myocarditis. A few weeks ago I started to get a dull chest pain at night and a dull aching sensation in my right arm. I ignored it for the first night as I go to gym and thought I may have pulled a muscle or it was just indigestion. The following night I had the same sensation and called 111 for advice which then called me an ambulance. The ambulance came and done an ECG which wasn't normal, I was taken to hospital where's I had further ECG and bloods and I was diagnosed with myocarditis. I was sent home and around a week after my diagnosis I received really fast heart palpitations whilst sitting at home out of no where, I was taken back to hospital but was told this was normal symptom or myocarditis, I have weird little turns every other day and it is horrible, I get short breathed and my heart has slight palpitations. I'm just posting this post to talk to someone that has had or currently has myocarditis for some re assurance and advice Thanks Charles"
Heart Attack,My son is 8 years old and due for his cardiac MRI and possibly cardic catheterization,"Hi my son was diagnosed with TF on my 20 week scan. He underwent the full repair at 4 months and has been very well since, in fact he is doing so well that he trains with Colchester football club and was recently scouted by Chelsea football club. My son is 8 years old now and we had his yearly check up yesterday, which has left him and me worried, so just looking for some reassurance.They said he would need his cardic MRI and a cardic catheterisation. I've had a Google up on what to expect but just wondered if this is just routine or if I should be prepared for the next op approaching. My son is more terrified about the dye being inserted via a needle.Really great full for any advice.Thanks xxx"

Heart Attack,Joint problems with Bisoprolol?,"I wonder if anyone has had this serious painful side effect from Bisoprolol. I have Class 2 heart failure and moderate mitral regurgitation. I was on 2.5 mg 2 years ago this was ramped up to 3.75 then a year ago to 5mg. In Jan last year I visited my GP as I had pain in my wrists, fingers, shoulders, back  and toes. Had blood tests and Xrays. No rheumatoid factor but some osteoarthritis. At 72 it'sno surprise. As the year went on the pain got worse and worse. I had both NHS and private physio with no joy or relief. The NHS physio said I should be referred on as she suspected with the symmetry and number of joints involved it was suspicious of a different problem. I had no help from my GP. By December last year I was becoming quite disabled. I couldn't undo even a milk carton or turn the key in my door without severe pain. Driving was so difficult because of my arms and shoulders being so painful. I was using supports on my wrists and had to buy a back support too. Finally I was struggling to dress myself. I suddenly realised that the pain originated from the increase in Bisoprolol. I had some 2.5mg tablets left which I decided to take instead. Day by day the pain decreased. Now a week on, my hands have improved so much as have my shoulders and back. \saw the cardiology nurse yesterday and am changing to  a different betablocker. The pain has n't totally gone as I am still taking 2.5 but the difference in my quality of life is enormous. I feel I have lost a year of my life. I went from being able to walk 6/7 miles in Derbyshire to being a disabled person all in a year. Any comments welcome. "
Heart Attack,Please help ASAP pericarditis? ,"I'm 20, I had open heart surgery 4 months ago as I had a large ASD 4cm x 5cm and they rebuilt my septum with part of my pericardium. Everything went so well, until 4 weeks ago, when I got rushed into hospital for severe pain in my shoulders, shallow breathing, sats between 89 - 91 and a pulse of 139 with a high temp. The pain was so intense that it made me vomit, I couldn't sit up, stand or lay back down without passing out. They done a full blood count, and two large bottles of blood (can't remember the name of the blood test) an MRI and an echo cardiogram. They found that I had an infection somewhere, and was my risk of a blood clot came back positive. They said this could have been because of the infection. I was treated with anti inflamatories and IV antibiotics aswell as high doses of clexane injections. 3 days later I was fine and was discharged. On Thursday this week. I woke shaking, freezing cold, I went to get up, the exact pain was back again. My temp was high, so I took anti inflamatories again. But by Friday morning the pain was so bad yet again I was screaming in pain unable to move. Again, took to hospital by ambulance. Tests came back that there was no infection this time. Yet the pain was even more severe than before even morphine didnt help it just knocked me out. They sent me home with tramadol and a course of anti biotics. 2 days later the pain is no better. I can breathe this time, my temp is fine, sats 96/97 and pulse 113. But the pain is unreal. Again tramadol not working. I have a pain under my breasts and in my scar, aswell as in my left shoulder that hurts constantly and when I move takes my breathe away. Doctors are saying pericarditis, as if its nothing. But all I read is horror stories. Please tell me they can treat this. There must be a medication that will take the pain away as it is so bad I've wished I was dead and even asked doctors to just put me to sleep so I don't have to suffer this pain any more. Someone please help. The doctors aren't 100% sure on the pericarditis, they don't know how to treat me so they pretty much just shunt me out the way. What do I do? I'm at my wits end, something MUST be able to take this pain away. Please help! "

Heart Attack,Pressure / tightness around heart,"So last year I was diagnosed with lone atrial fibrillation. I had a cardioversion in January this year which was successful but last month I had a few drinks and a Chinese and since then my heart/chest have felt weird. I have checked my pulse and it is still steady at 60-75 I can still excercise normally and my sinus rhythm feels fine. I went A&E as my heart felt really tight and felt some uncomfort around my body. They did my bloods and checked for heart attacks and angina and they said that was all clear, no high chloresteral pretty much all normal.. ECG was normal as well (twice) but I still feel tightness. I had an echo in November 2016 which was normal other than the AF. But I'm worried this is something again. The consultant said it could be gastric, muscular as well as other and of course they couldn't find out as it needs investigating. But what could it be and is there anything I can do to relieve pressure.Side note: I also do a lot of gym but have cut down on the heavy weights for now.Much appreciated for the help."
Heart Attack,"Heart palpitations, or anxiety or something else ","I've been dealing with palpitations for a while now. They have me on a beta blocker, I am also on lisinopril (HBP) lexapro and supposed to take buspar. I noticed when I was taking the buspar that my palpitations increased by 10 fold. Wore a Holter for 24 hours. Never heard back from cardiologist. He said if he found anything he would call. So assuming he hasn't found anything. I stopped the buspar last weekend and had no palps. So I went without it all week, but the tension and anxiety started creeping back in. So I took one yesterday morning and was okay...only a couple palpitations. Well I haven't had one today, and I've had what feels like palps all morning. The last round I put my fingers to my throat to feel my pulse as they were happening and there were absolutely no changes in my pulse rate, no hiccups or nothing. I am also on vitamin c, b12, coq10, vit e and vit d all of which are supposed to help with palps. So my question is this... are these heart palpitations that I am having or could they be something else that feels like heart palps ? I feel like I'm going crazy and I HATE living like this. I have a 4 month old and I just want my life back to normal so I can enjoy her.  Help. I've been dealing with palpitations for a while now.

Heart Attack,"Im 25 y.o. with Skiped heart beats, tachycardia and other issues. Please help!","Im a 25 year old male and I feel like an old man. About 5 years ago I had my first episode or irregular heart beats, and since them I have skiped beats and palpitations that appear randomnly, regardless of activity. Even tho at times certain activities like excercice might trigger them, but most of the times ot doesnt. During this period of 5 years, Ive had like 5 ekgs (not at the precise time of the symptoms), 3 holters for 24 hours and 2 echocardiograms. My cardiologist said my heart is normal and to avoid caffein and stress. However, this happens even when Im relaxed. I was on betablockers once for like 2 months but saw no difference so I stopped using them. I just kept living with them. But everytime I have a bad episode I get scared, afraid it might kill me. Today Im writting this because I had a 5 minute long episode of tachycardia and fluttering. It scared me once again. To make matters worse, Im also dealing with a bad case of GERD for like 11 months now and I spent most time in locked in my bedroom because I dont feel well. I would like to hear if other young people are going throught the same experience and if somebody has been able to stop this palpitations. "
Heart Attack,Instant Fatigue when doing explosive exercise  ,"I'm male 26. I'm a boxer training 4 times a week and i've done so for many years. I'm in very good physical condition but around 8-10 months ago I started noticing I was getting tired and lacking energy during training.  This has got dramatically worse to the point that 2 minutes into my first round of pad work my muscles instantly fatigue and I have to stop. 20 seconds of rest and im back to normal, but it happens again and again. Its become so bad that I have to go down on one knee to recover and sometimes I feel dizzy. I can normally do 12 three minute rounds on pads with ease. I feel completely fine other than this. I can jog 5km no problem, I only seem to have the problem with explosive exercises. I've been to my GP but I dont think she knows whats wrong with me. I had blood tests which showed I had a virus but at that time I had flu for two week so I think that was more to to with that. Can anyone tell me whats wrong? "
Heart Attack,"Diagnosed with bradycardia, arrhythmia and supraventricular ectopic beats.","Hi I am new here.

But before I see him , he has ordered me to have another 24 hour ECG, exercise ECG and an echocardiogram. Have any of you had this? I get lots of palpitations and breathlessness and dizziness. I used to faint occassionally Just a bit worried about what it could all mean. Im 37 and struggling with these symptoms as even the simplest of things like putting away laundry make me feel like I am going to pass out. Any ideas or experiences shared would be appreciated.

Heart Attack,Deciding to refuse cardiac catheterization.,"After doing the best I can to ferret out the risks vs benefits of cardiac catheterization.  92% of my brain says, ""No.""  That niggling 8% is a real pain.I am female.  I am over 60.  I have not had a myocardial infarction, (that they're telling me about anyway).  I have some stress wall hypertrophy, but that's pretty much it.  If I could get the physicians/cardiologists, to give me better evidence of need for such an invasive procedure, I might consider it...however...I know me.  Just having the procedure would be psychologically, and, therefore, physically, ruinous.  I think I understand - but who can understand this really - that choosing not to have the catheterization, and whatever may happen as a result, means I might sign out quite unexpected.  But is this a better way to live?  I think so.I have not felt ""well"" for at 7 years.  (I'll spare you the ailments).  However, I don't get colds, flu (no vaccinations)...I don't have hypertension.  I'm told I have angina, but I am convinced that the post-meal sensations I get are due to gastric/diaphragm...more on that order of things.  I don't have frank chest ""pain.""I'm figuring that it will be a complete craps shoot to refuse the catheterization, but I am 100% certain, that there is a better chance of me surviving an invasive procedure if I don't die before I have it, then lending myself to what looks like a never-ending routine of invasive procedures.What I'm currently hoping for, but have been unable to get, is a cardiologist who will agree to fully monitor me; one who truly understands the various medications available and who would find one that is best suited for this particular body, and who considers cardiac catheterization, et al, a last resort, rather than a first.  (Nice fantasy).So far, I've had the general practitioner I see, attempt to scare the hell out of me without telling me on what evidence he was doing so.  (I would change to another GP if there was another one around).  That kind of tactic is not only useless, but demoralizing.  When it comes to ""heart,"" demoralization can, without a doubt, lead to ""heart trouble.""It's all a quandry."

Heart Attack,Bisoprolol and diarrhoea?,"hi everyone, great forum and so helpful. I have leaky heart valves which will be operated on in a few months hopefully. The consultant put me on a strong water tablet for the cough due to  fluid on the lungs because of the heart problem. Also gave me 2.5 Bisoprolol, Took both for 8 days and had worst attack of diverticulitis for 10 years! Stopped both, been ill for 3 weeks and lost a stone (not a good look!) 4 days ago started the Bisoprolol but at 1.25  and now have diarrhoea every morning!!!! Prefer it to the opposite but now attached to the loo and have my angiogram Thursday miles away at 9.30 a.m. Worried sick about how I'll manage on the journey and when I get there, I may have to leap off the table to head for the loo !!!  Joking aside, does anyone else have the diarrhoea, no one has mentioned it.  The tiredness is pretty bad but I was already weak so maybe that's partly the reason.  Just hoping that  this may improve when my body becomes used to it. Could of course be delayed effects from the diver, who knows??? Happy days and best wishes to all of you battling these awful side effects."

Heart Attack,Skipped heartbeats ,All started in 2003 when I passed out and was diagnosed with a very slow heartbeat. My heart had a completely closed artery but had done its own bypass so the blood flow was good. I was implanted with a pacemaker and am now on my second battery life. Started feeling skipped beats and the pacemaker acting almost like a holter monitor pick them up and they said they were not the dangerous type. They occur mostly when I am inactive and are occupied with pain on my left side from my neck down to my stomach. I feel very inflamed. My breathing is fine but I do get anxiety because of these skipped beats. Has anybody had this type of experience and what advise would you give me on my next step. Thanks . 
Heart Attack,ectopic heart beats,"hi All im just hoping for some advice, around 12 months ago i started with ectopics beats. to say they scared me would be an understatement but after having a holter monitor and a echocardiagram the fear has eased but the annoyance of them havnt.some days there not so bad, but some days they are awful literally every few beats also worse when im lay down at night or active. i was put on bisprolol 1.25mg which didnt make any difference but made me very tired, so the doctor has no given me a calcium channel blocker called Diltiazem. has any body used this and had any good results ? i dont understand why but i am so scared of taking this in fear of how i will react so any advice would be greatly appreciated.i do need to get these under control as there taking over my life in a big way.any advice please"
Heart Attack,Does this sound like heart attack symptoms?,"So yesterday I was doing my normal routine at work, which is a high stress environment- management, dealing with a lot of people so you get lost in how busy you are. But then I started to come back down out of the chaotic haze and realized, wow, my inner-bicep hurts in my left arm. It felt like a torn muscle sensation. So I thought maybe the sleeves of my shirt were too tight. So I took it off, but it still felt strange- so naturally I started to go into research mode and everything I put it screamed heart attack.Other symptoms I guess is I have a sore neck, which I often get because of the nature of my job.My back under my shoulder blade on the left side has slight pain. Nothing major.I have a knot feeling on my left side, about 3-4 inches from my under arm, but I have done some moving around and certain positions seems to irritate it more so I chopped it up to something muscular.I have had indigestion for the last couple of days which is normal for me, but I did have a pretty bad case of it the yesterday which is the first day I felt the pain in my arm. No heartburn sensation. More just burping a lot and gassy feeling.Also, my arm pain subsided but did not go away until around 10pm last night. Also, the pain did progress from my bicep- to my shoulder then also in my forearm and wrist. My finger tips felt cold and numb, sort of tingling. The best way to describe the overall sensation was that I had a numbing dead arm with pain of a slightly torn muscle in my bicep with an aching shoulder.Self test of my heart rate put me at between 70-74bpm for several tries.Today, my arm pain has subsided but still there dully. Could have agitated something? I'm trying to fight what's really there and what my anxiety is making me focus on. I have a come and go pain I guess in my left side inner-pectoral where the muscle meets the bone- which I have had this sensation many times before and chopped it up to muscular. I do have a history of lifting weights, but not in the last 5 months.But here is my general information- I am a 26yo Male. On no medication. Diet isn't the best to be honest. I weight about 175-180lbs and I'm 5'6"" - 5'7"".Any help would be greatly appreciated. Does it sound like heart related issues? Or something else? And how long does the pain in an arm normally last in instances of heart related angina?"

Heart Attack,Could this be a heart attack or am I overreacting?,"Hi, for the past 6 hours i've had pain in my left chest and upper arm. It's fairly minor pain. I have been diagnosed with severe anxiety by 3 different doctors and am taking medication for it. I am twenty years old, I am a male and weigh 312 pounds, and my father died at 35 of a heart attack, these are the only potential causes for heart issues I have. I was checked at birth due to the doctors thinking I have heart issues, however I didn't. And due to my fathers heart attack I get a blood test once a year. I got mine in April of this year. My sugar was good, cholestorol was good, blood pressure is good, although it gets very high due to anxiety but when i'm not anxious it is within the normal range. Also my CBC and other organs were all perfect. Am I overreacting and just feeding my fear or should I go to the ER. It seems to get better when I don't think about it. I am currently trying to lose weight and live a healthier life before it's too late. However I am worried that it already is too late.

I have been diagnosed with severe anxiety by 3 different doctors and am taking medication for it. I am twenty years old, I am a male and weigh 312 pounds, and my father died at 35 of a heart attack, these are the only potential causes for heart issues I have. I was checked at birth due to the doctors thinking I have heart issues, however I didn't. And due to my fathers heart attack I get a blood test once a year. I got mine in April of this year. My sugar was good, cholestorol was good, blood pressure is good, although it gets very high due to anxiety but when i'm not anxious it is within the normal range. Also my CBC and other organs were all perfect. Am I overreacting and just feeding my fear or should I go to the ER. It seems to get better when I don't think about it. I am currently trying to lose weight and live a healthier life before it's too late. However I am worried that it already is too late. Any help and advice would be appreciated."
Heart Attack,heart failure,"My GP is treating me for fluid on the lungs with water tablets, aspirin and GTN spray I have been referred to a cardiologist, my appointment is 15th September should I try to get it brought forward as I feel quite unwell most of the time feeling very weak, loss of apetite, pain between my shoulder blades and central chest and shortness of breath. After a resent trip to A&E angina has been ruled out. "
Heart Attack,Is there something going on with my heart?,"I am a 36 year old man who is fairly active and in fairly good shape.  Lately I have been noticing that I am getting tired and short of breath, especially after mild exertion.  I am always feeling my heart pounding inside my chest, even when I am at rest.  My resting pulse always seems to be above 100bpm.  I will get hot, all of the sudden, and start feeling sick and start sweating.  I checked my blood pressure today and it was 176/106.  I also get dizzy and lightheaded all the time.  I am not sure if my symptoms are really something to worry about since I am so young or if I need to make an appointment with a cardiologist.  Heart disease does run in my family though.  My dad has AFIB and congestive heart failure and my grandparents on both sides had heart disease.  I think my issues have been happening since I was a kid.  I used to get hot and sick to my stomach all the time when I would go with my family to theme parks.  I couldn't play sports because I would get tired and start getting hot and sick again.  I would like to find out what is going on with my health because something definitely does not feel right.  I have also developed a cough that mostly comes on whenever I get short of breath.  I can't even do cardio at the gym because I get short of breath and my chest starts to hurt.  I have also experienced pain in the center of my chest as well as in my left arm and my left lower jaw on occasion. I have a slight fear of seeing the doctor.  I haven't been since I was 14.And, I have a new symptom to add:  last night I experienced pain in my chest(as I have for the past year) but after the pain there was a sharp tearing sensation in the area of my heart.  I never experienced a tearing pain before."
Heart Attack,Symptoms not always present for heart vale problems,"I had my aortic valve replaced in early 2014, and I thought that my story might be of interest to some of you that are reading this forum.I'm 62 now and I have been retired for several years.I live a fairly stress-free life, and maybe that is why I didn't know how bad my aortic valve was calcified. I had no symptoms at all.In march 2014 I was at a NASCAR race in Las Vegas and while walking from the parking area to our seats, I felt realy strange and had to sit down. My freind later said I looked grey.When I got back home, I didn't go to the doctor right away but I did notice that I was getting tired realy fast, so I saw my doctor and he sent me for an ultrasound. As soon as he finished, the technician advised me to see the heart specialist. The heart doctor in our local hospital checked me over and immediatly made an appointment for me in Toronto.I realy didn't have time to worry because the appointment was within a week so off I went to see a heart surgeon who sent me for an angiogram a couple of days after that. I was supposed to go up to the surgeons office to see him after but he met me in recovery with all the paperwork for a valve replacement and said that it is usually a 3 month wait for the surgery, but he was going to have a valve in me within the month.

Heart Attack,Chest Pain Anxiety?,"I was hospitalised in September for heart palpitations and had an ECG and 2 blood tests and a chest x ray and hey couldn't find anything wrong and discharged me. 3 weeks ago I had a bad palpitation and nearly passed out.

Heart Attack,Random heart palps? Should I worry?,"Been having heart palps the last few days. And when I say heart palps, I mean that fluttering breathing feels weird feeling. No dizziness with it or pain. I just start taking deep breaths to see if it helps. My anxiety has been bad the last few days, more than usual. I just finished a z-pack this week. That's the only thing I can thing of that would cause this? I feel like it keeps happening but then I can't tell if my mind is starting to play tricks on me because I'm nervous about it lol I was at doc Wednesday for another reason and had physical therapy today (where it was taken multiple times) and my BP was good at all places. I've always had a fast heart rate (100 usual / 88-90 resting). Within the last year I've had some chest pain (sharp feeling; due to other reasons) which I've had a nuclear stress test, tons of EKGs, lots of blood work, 24 holter monitor, and an echocardiogram. They're all normal.This feeling is unsettling tho. Should I worry? "
Heart Attack,2 heart attacks in five days.,"The first attack was early Thursday morning 10 days ago. I woke with excruciating pain in my upper ams, back, chest, shoulders and jaw. ( This was worse than the pain of childbirth or the burst appendix I suffered some years back). I took very strong painkillers, and after a few hours, the pain subsided and I went to sleep.  I attributed the pain to my recent use of a walker (zimmer frame).  Early Monday morning, I awoke with the same terrible pain.  This time, my husband insisted I go to the hospital where I was told I was having a heart attack and given morphine for the pain.  The next day, an angioplasty determined that one cardiac artery was 90% blocked, 2 others 40%. A stent was inserted in the 90% blocked one.  I went home the next day. I am 81 years old, slightly overweight (about 10 pounds), and my physical activity is to some degree hampered by an arthritic left knee and pain in the left foot (the aftermath of surgery to remove a bunion, fuse the bones  of my big toe, and amputate the toe next to it). What are my chances of  having a third heart attack (I had something several years ago that was later diagnosed as a""cardiac spasm"", whatever that is.   Has anyone any advice or information that might help me?"
Heart Attack,Heart Failure at 19,"Hello,I was diagnosed as having Osteosarcoma nearly five years ago. The cancer had spread and moved into my lungs and heart. Because of the combination of the location of the tumour and the treatment, this left me with heart failure. I'm not on the list for a transplant because I'm not stable enough to undergo one. I'm absolutely devastated. I'm 19 years old and my entire life is going to be snatched away from me. I was born with ToF and HLHS so I'm no stranger to heart defects. I've had a heart attack previously when a tumour blocked an artery. I currently still have cancer but the treatment has been stopped because it's no longer in effect. I'm so scared about all of the complications with my heart. I don't want to die."
Heart Attack,Palpitations and pains,"For over a month now I been having sharp pains in my arms, shoulders, neck and jaw. Some days they are good some days they are not.

Heart Attack,Ongoing chest pain,"Hello. I am a 33 year old male who has been having recurring chest pain that usually gets worse throughout the day. It happens for days on end. Sometimes when this happens I also get a strange feeling in my left hand. I've been diagnosed with GERD and my gastro thinks it's just the heartburn but I don't know. I had a CT Angiogram in March that said I had no blockages and my calcium score was 0. I have had chest x-rays and EKGs that have all been normal. I used to smoke but I quit almost ten years ago. I don't have high blood pressure but do have high cholesterol. Am I just being crazy or should I be concerned?Thanks."
Heart Attack,Echo,"Any one have a weird echo, I went to have my echo today and the technician asked why I was having one, I said I use to have pericardial effusion, but I recently developed arrhythmia, having PVC. During the echo he asks me if they ever discussed how large the effusion was, I said the doctors dismissed it and said everyone has fluid around there heart and they did a wait and watch approach why do you ask?  The technician then truned the screen toward me and said I still had a pericardial effusion, I told him at one point they sent me to a cardiac thoracic surgent to get the fluid removed and he felt at the time it was not needed. He then asked if I had prior echo's at that facility, yes I did,  he then excused himself to look at the prior echo's. He came back and said that the effusion looked smaller, but when I laid on my back to get a different view of my heart  he said that the effusion was unchanged. But it showed it was not compressing the heart and hopefully my body just adapted. He ended by doing my doctor will have results today or tomorrow. Should i be worried?  I wonder if that what is causing my arrythmias?? And i understand you have a small amount of fluid naturally around the heart. I wonder if the doctor will compare all my echo's???

Heart Attack,SVT - Cather ablation advice ,"Hi everyone,So I met with my cardiologist yesterday and he has advised I have the ablation only due to the fact of how I am currently putting my life on hold (too scared to do anything) and not because I actually need it. I am 23 and feel like I am missing out in life as I'm too scared to drink/eat things I shouldn't.. He said my SVT is probably going to take an hour to ablate and should be straightforward. Can anyone please describe to me how this procedure works from start to finish as I really need some positive feedback to sway my mind to go through with this.Thank you! "

Heart Attack,Have I had a mild heart attack?,I'm looking for some opinions here because I'm worried sick following and A&E admission a couple of days ago. Last week whilst sitting I developed this excruciating chest pain. Sharp pain through to the back and radiating up to my jaw only. It lasted a couple of hours and I put it down to reflux/indigestion which I've never experienced. Thot nothing else of it. On tues I was admitted to A&E with ongoing palpitations which lasted about 12 hours. ECG showed back to back ectopics. Bloods and echo normal. Went home with holter tape. ETT was ok but doc says I've got benign ventricular ectopy. One of the docs in A&E said my chest pain last week could have been MI but echo was normal and the cons didn't mention it again. I'm now petrified I've had a mild heart attack. I feel really stressed about it. My cons didn't mention it when I saw him yesterday and I wish I had asked. Not seeing him for 3months. Any advice?

Heart Attack,"I can see my heartbeat in my chest and stomach - i'm worried, is this an aortic aneurysm?","Hi, i'm a 20 year old female, and i've noticed that i can see my heartbeat in my stomach and my left breast. I first noticed this when i was 17. I didn't notice this previously, but i'm not sure its because i was looking for problems at the time. As a hypochondriac I was convinced that i ahd a thyroid problem (but tests have ruled this out) and the more i read about thyroid disorders, i was on the look out for 'heart symptoms' and would often check my pulse, etc. Anyway, one day while laying on the couch, i noticed that my stomach moved to the rhythm of my heartbeat and my left breat did the same thing. I don't understand this, my left breast and stomch literally have this pulse 24/7, and if i place my phone on my chest on stomach i can see it bouncing to the rhythm of my heartbeat. I'm slim, and have small breats if that helps, but i wouldn't call my self skinny, and I exercise fairly regularly (at least half an hour of walking fast a day). I've been looking things up on the internet (which i know is a bad idea anyway, especially if you are a hypochondriac and have anxiety) because i wanted to see if anyone else had these issues, because none of my family did, even though they didn't think it seemed unusual. It came up with AAA which really scared me, even though it said most common in older male patients.  I don't really have a family history of heart disorders, only that my late Grandad had two heart attacks, both of which he survived and he had them when he was older and he was slightly overweigtht with various health problems, but no heart disease etc.  Of course also I found that in some cases that this was normal and some people's aorta' were just close to the surface and could be visible. I'm really scared and i've been thinking about it a lot lately wondering if its truly 'normal' so i'm going to try and make a doctors appointment soon, but in the meantime, does this sound normal to you or is this something wrong?Thanks in advanceHi, i'm a 20 year old female, and i've noticed that i can see my heartbeat in my stomach and my left breast.

Heart Attack,From the heart,"Hi I am a 33 year old female, who a year ago was sent to a cardiologist for a pericardial effusion. They determined it was idiopathic. Some time had gone by, I was evaluated for over a year, with countless ecg and multiple echo's later. During which I developed palpitations. I wore a heart holster for 48hr. They did see I was having superventricular episodes, but said they were within normal limits. Since all my test came back within normal limits I was released, even though I stated I was having intermittent chest pain, my palpitations changed and sometimes I get dizzy and short of breath with some palpitations. So I went to get a second opinion, I seen this doctor twice, he ran two ecg, and redid the heart holster test, when I went back to get my results they said everything was okay. Then I got a call from there office saying they read the wrong heart holster test, they read the one from the prior doctor, to come in to redo a egg, they had the hospital fax over the correct heart holster test, needless to say, they said something came up on the egg and the heart holster and my appointment is in two days. I know people are human and make mistakes, but should I go to someone else? I mean if you don't have time to read the test results and know your reading the wrong ones, how can I trust I'm getting the best care. This is after all my heart your talking about. What should I do??"
Heart Attack,"Chest pain, shortness of breath, terrible family history","Hi. For over a week I've been experiencing fairly constant chest pain and shortness of breath - both ease up at times but are always there to a degree. Just prior I had some sort of a virus with achin essence, sore throat etc and so initially thought it was to do with this. I've also had higher than normal blood pressure up to 150/80  (I always have very low blood pressure around 100/60), higher than normal pulse (resting in the 80s and 90s).

Heart Attack,Was it a heart attack?,"I'm a 33 year old female, non smoker, with a very strong family history of death from heart attacks. My mum died at 45 of a heart attack, her mum died at 52 and several of my mums brothers and sisters have either had heart attacks or have high cholesterol. Just before midnight on Saturday night I developed excruciating back pain between my shoulder blades, slightly to the right. The pain then spread around the right hand side of my back, under my right arm pit and across the front of my chest. I was getting ready for bed at the time so I wasn't particularly exerting myself. I got in bed and tried lying on my back but I felt like I was being crushed front and back. I tried all sleep positions but just couldn't get comfortable. I got out of bed, went downstairs and took two soluble aspirin but it didn't ease. The pain was that bad that I had to wake my dad. I phoned 111 and they sent an ambulance. They did an ECG which they said was normal and the paramedic said she thought it might be a pulmonary embolism. In hospital, I had another ECG (normal) and a blood test to rule out the pulmonary embolism. The doctor wasn't going to do the blood test to check if I'd had a heart attack, but did when I insisted. However the blood test was done only 5 hrs after the onset of symptoms and I believe it needs to be repeated several hours after to see if my enzyme levels had risen. However, the test was not repeated and I was sent home to follow up with my GP! I feel that I was fobbed off because they were busy and they just assumed it wasn't a heart attack as I'm only 33. I now feel like I will never know if it was a heart attack or not and my heart may already be damaged. I know nstemi heart attacks don't always show on ECGs. Is there anyway I can find out if it was a heart attack or not? "
Heart Attack,My 12 week old beautiful son born with Tetralogy and Digeorge; Just need POSITIVE success stories,"My angels story. My baby was diagnosed with Tetralogy at 2 days old and Digeorge at a little over a week old. Heartbreak is an understatement. His dad and I lived at the NICU for over 3 weeks. He is my 4th son by the way and my 1st to have this. He was kept at the NICU for so long because of feeding issues and his calcium was low (labs everyday at 5am was the worst for my little love) so he was put on calcium supplement and calcitriol.. since then he was taken off calcium because it has maintained great but he still takes the calcitriol once a day. He was also on a feeding tube and that was taken out once he could eat 2oz on his own and then we went home. Since he's been born it's been non stop Dr's he literally has a team. But when I say he is amazing I truly mean that. He is hitting all this milestones was rolling over at 4 weeks old, smiles all the time, talks to us, tracks sounds, makes great eye contact, holds his head up great. The only issue is his little heart is burning calories so fast weight gain is a problem PLUS he has strider (noisy breathing/floppy tissue above the voice box) which gets better on its own but in his case might have to be repaired before surgery because that's also burning calories making it harder to gain weight. He's currently on 24 cal and that has helped. His surgery is scheduled for November 11th but the roof of his mouth was blue tonight while he was crying I noticed it for the 1st time and his oxygen level was 84.. but it climbed thank god and stayed above 90 so we'll be keeping a close eye on that. BUT really with all of this I focus on the positive with him he's just so amazing such a little fighter wants so much to be happy .. I honestly forget all this is happening until I go to one of his many dr appointments or his home nurse comes here. I really need to hear positive stories, success.. great things children with TOF and Digeorge have done and what they've overcome , the difference after surgery. This is what all parents with children that are battling things like this need to hear.. there has to be light at the end of the tunnel. So please share the good things <3 Thank you and God bless you all and your beautiful babiesMy angels story. My baby was diagnosed with Tetralogy at 2 days old and Digeorge at a little over a week old. Heartbreak is an understatement. His dad and I lived at the NICU for over 3 weeks. He is my 4th son by the way and my 1st to have this. He was kept at the NICU for so long because of feeding issues and his calcium was low (labs everyday at 5am was the worst for my little love) so he was put on calcium supplement and calcitriol.. since then he was taken off calcium because it has maintained great but he still takes the calcitriol once a day. He was also on a feeding tube and that was taken out once he could eat 2oz on his own and then we went home. Since he's been born it's been non stop Dr's he literally has a team. But when I say he is amazing I truly mean that. He is hitting all this milestones was rolling over at 4 weeks old, smiles all the time, talks to us, tracks sounds, makes great eye contact, holds his head up great. The only issue is his little heart is burning calories so fast weight gain is a problem PLUS he has strider (noisy breathing/floppy tissue above the voice box) which gets better on its own but in his case might have to be repaired before surgery because that's also burning calories making it harder to gain weight.

Heart Attack,Stuck for what to do,"This is the first time I've ever joined a forum but I don't know where to turn to. About 2 months ago I had a 'panic attack' whilst in work. I had a number of heart flutters and my pulse went through the roof. I was shaking all over and I turned pale. There was no pain but I was convinced that I was having a heart attack. A paramedic was called and my pulse was still a little high but my blood pressure was fine and my ECG was fine. They took me to A&E just to get checked out.I was asked all the usual questions like do I smoke, do I drink, how much coffee do I drink etc. I was sent home afterwards. For about 2 days I felt like a train had hit me, I didn't feel right at all. I was worried about having another attack and I totally lost my appetite. I went to my doctors and was diagnosed with a general anxiety disorder. I was shown some breathing excercises and was booked in for a follow up ECG. The results of the ECG came back normal and I was prescribed antidepressants (citalopram). After starting to take them I began having an attack every other day in the early hours of the morning so I began to get really worried. After stopping taking them the attacks subsided for a while and I began to feel better. i started getting other symptoms, mostly in my left arm, things like pins and needles and strange sensations along with some pain that lasted only a few seconds. My doctor booked me in for full blood works (which all came back normal) I had one MASSIVE attack about a week ago and I had to phone an ambulance because I was stuck in between work and home and it's put me back to square one. Beyond square one in fact because I haven't felt right since and I'm now terrified that I've been misdiagnosed with anxiety. I'm getting more symptoms than before and whereas, normally I would get better after a day or 2, I still feel like total crap after a week. I've gone back to my doctor to tell him this and he just rolled his eyes, sighed and said he's gonna refer me to a cardiologist. So even he's given up trying to tell me it's anxiety. It's gonna take months to be seen by a specialist and I'm convinced I'm not gonna last that long. I am in dire need of help and I don't know what to do. Thank you for taking the time to read this. "
Heart Attack,Not sure about stents,"I'm 70 years old now. 2004 I had triple bypass. 2010 I had another bypass because the left one failed. Now my cardiologist wants to do a heart catherization because of a difference in the pictures taken during a stress test. He says he may use a stent if there is significant blockage. I guess my question is ,  do stent really work. Haven't found anyone with stent that didn't need reopening in a year or two. Has anyone here had stents for any length of time ?  I'm very active and eat very healthy. I guess that's why my 2004 bypasses have stayed open. I know 70 isn't young but I don't feel 70.I'm 70 years old now. 2004 I had triple bypass. 2010 I had another bypass because the left one failed.

Heart Attack,Could this year of symptoms be related to heart or circulation?,"Hi allHave posted before but I'm unsure I'm getting the right groups. Any help would really benefit me at the moment as my symptoms persist. For the past 14 months I have been pretty much constantly lightheaded. I've never passed out and it varies in its intensity but it's quite bad this week leaving me in bed all day today feeling on the brink of fainting. This time felt very sick too. Although lately my pain seems to be in the arms it has been elsewhere in the body and is short and stabby, knee feet ankles arms wrists hands. I have had an ecg, celiac tests, full blood count, liver function, brain mri, pelvic mri and ultrasound, hepitits tests, all fine apart from gallstones and a large fibroid and I'm unsure if these would cause this. My arms and hands tingle and go a bit blue too and I sometimes have a numb hue about my body.I'm worried I have poor circulation because of the faint feeling but in your experiences does this sound like it's heart related?  Thanks"
Heart Attack,Anxiety or Heart issues?,"For the last month I have been dealing with what may be anxiety or heart related pain.I am a 21 year old male who apparently judging by the tests is quite healthy.This all started when chest pain came on while I was at work. It was stabbing and caught me off guard. I immediately panicked thinking that this could be something serious. I got in with my doctor the next day who diagnosed this as a muscle strain. Next day the pain moved more into my back and now I'm having painful upper back pain and chest pain have for the last month. The pain is more on the left side of my body which is even more scary and is a achey pain. I offten feel extremely tense and almost have a choking sensation in my throat. My chest feels tight when I exhale and don't immediately inhale. The acheyness is pretty constant but it seems to agrivate it when I get up and move around. I have tried hard to remain calm but still find myself obsessing over what this is as it is really playing into my life. When I go out with friends I find myself worrying about if it is heart related or something serious what would happen.I have had multiple tests done including:Lymes diseaseFull blood countThyroid blood testSED testECGChest X-rayVitamin D deficiency test.Fibromyalgia pressure point testAll of these have come back perfect. So apparently I'm healthy? My doctor told me this last week he has checked off the list and thinks these pains could be a double edged sword of anxiety. Where I am scared this could be something else and that is making my pain worse. He prescribed me cymbalta and I have been taking that for the last week. I understand that takes time to kick in so I don't expect instant results. Just wondering if this seems like it could be angina or related or if I am just over reacting. In total I've seen more than one doctor now and been into the doctors 6 times over the last month."

Heart Attack,Started having heart issues.,"3yrs ago started occassional dizzy spells and groggy feelings in morning. About this time right arm pain caused me to go into shock Pain was between shoulder and elbow outside of arm.Collesteroll check put me on Statins (Atarovastain 40mg) but started having muscle aches so left off since then. Want ot go back on to reduce Coll. but read on.About 3 mths ago (just after stopping Statins) woke up 3am by all round upper chest pain. lasted about 3 mins. Put it down to the Statins but now realise this was more likely a Heart Attack albeit a small one. Did nothing at the time.That arm pain is now also in the left arm and have to be careful how I move my arms otherwise it ramps right up.Felt dizzy one evening and notice heart readings were 175/90 with 90 beat. Usually I am 145/65. Went to Hostpital had ECG which confirmed Heart Attack history and no other blood warnings though. Discharged.Recently now getting quick angina type pains aroud upper torso and sometime in left arm. Once out walking got chest pains for 10 mins. Daily now I get these ""twinges"" with occassional twinge in neck.My conclusion is that I am developing the unstable angina with possible Heart Attack likey as before. Due to consult with Dr. next week.Thing is no good going to hospital without some positive indication that anything is wrong!Any comment or advice welcome. "

Heart Attack,Heart disease?,"Hi! I am a 24 yo male. Not overweight (Weight 55kg and height 168cm), not smoker, no heart issues history.It started when I felt a throbbing pain slightly above my left flank. It lasts for like 3 seconds and it is gone but reoccurred like 5 times again on the same day then gone forever.I thought it is no big deal, maybe just some kidney stone so I just drank more water for the next few days.However, after like 3 days I began to have a bit of shortness of breath especially when I am lying down. The first night was still acceptable but the next was worse.Then the next night, once I laid down, I can “hear” my heart beating in my mind and the standard shortness of breath. It was so strong that it woke me up. The heart rate is about 80+ when that is happening. The next morning I then went to a clinic and had an ECG done and the result are fine. The doctor guessed maybe it is anxiety.Then the next night again when I was trying to sleep, I get the same hearing my heart beat problem, shortness of breath but now with chest pressure and a bit burning sensation feeling. I went to a hospital and took a blood test, ECG and chest x ray and everything is fine. The doctor is guessing maybe it is acid reflux that is causing the burning sensation so gave me some  Famotidine. Because it will have some side effects so I took Gaviscon double action tablet instead. The burning sensation did not get better but it seems to move down from my chest to my abdomen area and continue to burn for like 24 hours. The next few days I switch back to Famotidine and just hoping for the better.Over the next few days, my symptoms seems to be switching. Lying down or not does not matters. I am getting chest pressure, mild chest pain and shortness of breath at times when I am doing normal stuffs like walking. My body seems to get the tingling sensation more often than normal. Both my hands’ biceps muscles are aching for no reason. I am sleeping better though but still I will wake up at least once when I sleep which isn’t normal for me. Once I woke up suddenly, feeling like vomiting but there is nothing to vomit but my heart is beating hard again.Anyway, I finally visited a heart specialist clinic. I did a ECG, 2d echocardiogram and treadmill ECG and according to the doctor, there is nothing wrong with my heart. His guess is maybe other reasons like viral infection.However, I am still having some trust issues because the symptoms are crazily similar to heart issues. Is anyone suffering the same problem as me? What are the chances after so many docotors and tests? How reliable is a 2d echocardiogram in spotting heart issues?Additional information is my blood pressure seems to be lower than my normal 100-110 as time. Sometimes I can get like 90 and my heart beat as slow as 51. "
Heart Attack,Uncomfortable sensation around heart since last 8 months,"Hi,I am 29 years old, eight months back i had an incident of heart palpitation(doctor said it was palpitations), my ECG that was done next day was fine, Bp was 140/90. Since then i am having a needle like pricking sensation around heart region (sternum to be more particular), sometimes it feels like itching from inside.... its not all the time but whenever i do even something little stressfull both physically and mentally it comes back. I checked with doctors, ECG was fine, there is no pain anywhere else so they could not tell what it is... Is it possible that because of that palpitation there maybe some internal damage to some vessel or organ ? what test i can take to confirm the same ?"

Heart Attack,Triple Heart Bypass 12 Months Ago,"Hi all, I ham 66 years yound and I had a triple heart bypass 12 months ago. It has for me been a hard and painful 12 months but mainly my left leg and foot where they  removed the vein for the bypass. I am happy I am alive so don't think I am moaning and I highly praise the team at Glenfield Hospital where the operation was done. However some 12 months have passed now and I have been suffering with my leg and foot for a long time. The pain in my foot is gout the doctor says and granted I suffered with gout before the heart attack. Yes it was an emecency heart bypass after a heart attack or 2. I am now on various tablets (pills) and obviously these are keeping me alive and looking after my heart. I take an aspirin (75mg) a day to keep my blood thin and also I take Atorvastatin (80mg), Ramipril (2,5mg), Furosemide (40mg), Bisoprolol (1.25mg and Allopurinol (100mg) every day. All these as well as pain killers (Paracetomol and Ibuprofen). Myself I feel good and my heart is fine but it is so darn frustrating that my foot lets me down because I want so much to get out and walk or ride my bike (new one) but I cannot get far without my foot hurting. The doctor gave me a course of colchicine but only enough for a week @2 a day but now my foot is feeling much much better. Now all I have to do is go back to the doctors (such a struggle to get there) for a blood test and maybe up my dose of the Allopurinol as to keep the gout away. These tablets will be for life as it will be a preventative medicine. Now I do not care how many tablets I have a day because I am just glad to be alive. I just want to share my experience with anyone out there and we can learn together and maybe give each other some ideas. All I want now is to get out and do some walking and to keep as fit as I can under the circumstances. I am a little overweight now (a lot) because when I did have my heart attack I immediately gave up smoking after being a smoker since I was 14. I started to taste my food better and I started to enjoy my food but I was eating too much and put a lot of weight on. Now I need desperately to go on a diet and to excercise more. So let's get together and discuss it with each other and maube try a little competition between us to who can lose the weight if you are overweight of course. It's been a long battle for me as is has been for many I know. Thank you for reading this.  "

Heart Attack,went to hospital for left sided chest pain ecg abnormal then back to normal ???,hey ive been having really bad chest pains and it lead me to go to the e.r today they ran ecg test and kept saying its abnormal after like 3 readings and they thought i was having a heart attack.. my blood work troponin kept coming back normal twice and they wanted to keep me over night to see the cardiologist in the morning about my ecg. now about 2 hours later a new nurse came in and wanted to do another ecg so she did and moved the wires around different and bam ecgs all of a sudden kept coming back normal after 2 different ones. so they decided to send me home. now im weirded out by this and feel uneasy could something have been wrong and then the ecg just picked up a normal few readings or would its constantly be altered if it was bad ? or did they just not have the wires in the correct location  ? 
Heart Attack,Heart murmur picked up by gp,Gp found a heart murmur when doing a physical examination today. Im 22 years old and have no other symptoms other than ive noticed being breathless recently which could just be down to being out of shape. She has referred me to get an echocardiogram just to be sure but said she wasnt overly worried just didnt think it would be wise to leave it without further investigation. Should i be worried and has anyone gone through something similar? ThanksAbi
Heart Attack,Stemi-left ventricular mural thrombus- blockage in left anterior descending coronary artery,"Hello, I had a heart attack at the end of 2015 but I didn't call for an ambulance because I thought that the pain was due to the return of a pleural effusion that had only just cleared up. I went to the hospital on Jan 5 2016 for a follow up procedure that had been arranged during my treatment for the pleural effusion and I was admitted immediately . I was told that I had a left ventricular thrombus and anticoagulant therapy started within minutes. Two or three days into my stay I had an angiogram and it was found that I had a blockage in my L.A.D I was informed that I had suffered a heart attack and the pain I thought was due to my previous pleural effusion was a S.T.E.M.I  I was told that because my blockage was in an awkward area it wouldn't be safe to stent me before an m.r.i scan was done. It is now September 2016 and I still haven't had a scan. I have been to my G.P five or six times to enquire as to why I am still waiting and no satisfactory answer has come back from the hospital.

Heart Attack,Mitro valve prolapse ,"Hi, my boyfriend who is 29 years old has just today seen a specialist regarding the possibility of testing for Chrones disease. However the specialist picked up on something that his doctor whom he saw a couple weeks back, did not. When the specialist asked of any specific ailments, he mentioned how he has been having chest pains, but said he went to the doctor and the doctor dismissed it as a ""pulled muscle"". I've refused to believe this since hearing that diagnosis, but I'm no doctor, so I basically shut up about it. However today when he mentioned to the endocrinologist specialist-the doctor immediately took a listen of his heart-and immediately suggested booking him in for a heart echo after believing he may have a mitral valve prolapse. Normally I would be riding my high and mighty horse saying ""I was right"" and stuff to my boyfriend, but not this- more like I want to take a sledge hammer to the dickhead doctors Saab or whatever $200,000 car he drives who misdiagnosed my boyfriend with such a pretty bloody important heart condition. So, we have scheduled an Echo to test for sure but yeah I'd like to hear of anyone's stories regarding this condition- symptoms before and after finding out that you have this heart condition, how it has impaired your life at all, any surgical stories...anything-preferably tho stories from males aged 25-35 years old.

Heart Attack,CT angiograms and failing beta blockers,"Thankyou for letting me join your discussion group, I was hoping that someone would have better knowledge of the CT Angiograms.  I had mine today and they had great difficulty getting my heart rate to reduce, despite my morning dose of a beta blocker, 2 tablets in the clinic and then the cardiac consultant gave me 4 doses through my I.V line...Im assuming that it did eventually work as they then continued the scan and I felt like I had fainted for a short period....but Im anxious now that there is a reason behind why they couldnt reduce my heart rate in the first place? is this an indication of heart disease in itself?Any info would be gratefully received...Many thanksSarah"

Heart Attack,March19th 2016 sufferd heart attack age 26 ,"I am 26 years of age and one night after a long day at work I was getting into bed and started getting intense chest pains the type of pain you get when food is stuck but it was 100 times more Intense and unbearable. I was getting hot and cold with this pain for about 5mins then started to vomit and shoulders and arms was very weak. I woke up my mum and called a amberlance they arrived quickly. Performed a ecg and told me I was having a (heart attack) and rushed me to hospital where I had two (cardiac arrest)I was informed this happend because the fat in my artrie that runs down the front of the heart had broken of from the wall and formed a blood clot to repair the wall of the artrie with formed a blockige with was also very high up the artrie and another part of the atrie had collapsed. I have no family history of heart conditions I now have two stents fitted and a thombos I think it's called in my heart with I believe is a very little blood clot I now take these medications daily Aspirin 75mgRivaroxaban 20mg Clopidogrel 75mgBisoprolol 2.5mgRamipril 5mg Atorvastatin 80mg Lansoprazole 30mg The doctors and the hospital tell me that I'm ok and the risk of something like this happening again is very very low My reason for starting this discussion is because I am struggling very bad to cope and come to terms with this mentally and phiscly It plays on my mind 24hours of the day i worry so much I fell like at any point I could just die. I can't sleep I stay awake till early hours of the morning because I am scared untill I can't keep my eyes open any more i sometimes find myself crying at nothing and also stressing over the financial position this has put me in. I fill shortness of breath sensations in my chest,back,arms/armpits that my not even be there mybe they are it's got to the point where I don't know anymore if I'm felling it or if it's just in my head.  When I take my concerns to my doctor he tells me everything will be fine go home rest and stop worrying this will all pass with time. But I can't seem to do it i fell so drained and don't know what to do. I don't want to live like this I just want to fill like myself again to be normal and fell free from what I can only decribe as torture   I put on a brave face and tell people I'm ok but I'm not ok  Will this every go away and will I return to the strong confident character I once was ? If anybody has any advice that mybe helpfully to me I would be very grateful. "

Heart Attack,"AMI, LVEF, TT","Had AMI Widowmaker (100% occlusion) in April this year.  Single stent left anterior downward coronary artery.  No other isues with arteries. No history of heart disease. No symptoms leading up to AMI.  Healthly, exercise regularily, don't smoke, 55 years, etc.  Serious heart damage, but I feel OK.Day after, AMI echocardiogram identidied LV Thrombus.  LVEF 20 percent.   Was doing the triple thearpy blood thinner.  Asaprin, Plaxiv, and Warfarin.   Just did another echocardiogram and doctor consultation (so almost 4 months after AMI and first echo.).  LVEF is still low (25-30 percent, dang!). Thrombus appears to have resolved (good).  Doctor was not optimistic about strong recovery of heart functions EF (strange).  Very, very discouraging.  He asked me to stop the warafin due to LV Thrombus resolution.  With low LVEF, I am terrified of developing another LV Thrombus and cerebrial embolism, but he thinks the bleeding risk outwieghs the risk of embolism.  Also wants me to get a defibrillater (ICD).   Have done lots of reading about these issues and not much guidance and few studies.Comments?"

Heart Attack,Left heart valve ,"Hello my mother in law aged 69 had a heart attack in November. It is now August. She has been unwell since it happened and was hospitalised a couple of times for excess fluid build up despite being on the dietetics etc. she is currently in hospital again and she is very ill. Extremely fatigued, breathing shallow and they have taken in the last week 12 kilos of fluid off her. Her kidneys aren't working as well as they should be and her liver is struggling a bit. Her eyes look cloudy, she hardly talks and can't move much. Practically bed ridden except when physio comes in to try and sit her up in a chair and do a couple of little exercises after that she is exhausted and basically drifts in and out of sleep. She is in the Coranary Care Unit. We still don't really know what is happening and if she will recover has anyone got any advice except for a meeting in which we are trying to organise with specialists. Has anyone experienced this and can tell us what is happening here. Much appreciated.Hello my mother in law aged 69 had a heart attack in November. It is now August.

Heart Attack,High cholesterol genetic abnormality ,I saw my cardiologist today he said my total cholesterol was around 250 and LDL 151 and trig 268. He saidSince I am 41 years old and 20 lbs overweight it's likely that I have a chromosome or zygote abnormality which causes me to have very high cholesterol he is considering putting me on a statin.What does this mean in terms of risk of dying young? Do people with genetic issues leading to very high cholesterol tend to die young?I saw my cardiologist today he said my total cholesterol was around 250 and LDL 151 and trig 268.

Heart Attack,Endocarditis - what happened to me...,"I am certainly not a hypochondriac and don't go around worrying about health issues. I have had endocarditis twice though (1997 and 2003) so I think its okay for me to check websites for information every so often.As I have had subacute endocarditis twice I thought I would share my experience with other who may have this condition and are maybe worried.Way back in 1997 (I was 44 then) I gradually started to go off my food and generally have a lack of energy. I would get home from work and just want to lay down and rest. This went on for maybe 3 weeks or so. I developed night sweats and was feeling more and more tired.After a lot of nagging my wife marched me to the doctors who sent me off for a blood test. I read on the form she gave me the words 'endocarditis risk'. I had no idea what this was at the time. Only the next day I had just gone to bed after a long night shift at work when the phone rang. It was the doctors surgery ringing to say that I had to go to hospital. Much to my surprise I would apparently have to stay in too!I soon found myself on a ward for 5 weeks having regular doses of antibiotics, initially 4 times a day reducing to twice a day. Once I starte feeling better I was allowed to go home for a few hours a day every so often, but not allowed to stay away overnight.I suppose I would say my main sympton is summed up in one work - fatigue. I would say this is different to just tiredness - I felt I had no energy or strength and mostly just wanted to doze.During this spell in hospital I was treated with gentamicin and penicillin. After about 3 weeks I developed an allergy to penicillin - two varieties of rash and very high temperature. This made me feel worse and I had a realy problem eating anything and walking short distances was a problem - no chance of a trip home.Once the doctors worked out that it was  the pencicillin that was causing the problem they changed me to teikoplanin (?spelling). after a week or so I was feeling much better and was allowed home just before Christmas and was back at work after a total of 8 weeks off.The was only episode one. I had another brush with endocarditis at the end of 2003. I noticed I was getting feverish and a feeling of fatigue. No hesitation in going to the doctors this time. I was in hospital for 4 weeks but needed longer to recover having nearly 4 months off work.For background I should mention that it was found that I had a heart murmour when I was 21. I have never had any symptoms of this. Apparently a heart murmour makes you more likely to get endocarditis.If you are worried about endocarditis you can get in touch if you like. I am now compeletely fit and well."

Not going to see the cardiologist for a few months either. The last time i went to a&e the doctor suggested it could be acid reflux so now i am undergoing tests for that and to see if i have the helicocapter bacteria? this was a couple of days ago.I am normally quite active and go to the gym doing avergage excercise but this is when i had my first svt attack so now scared to go to the gym until cardioligist says i can. blood tests are all fine also i am just extremley worried its still my heart even being told my heart is fine and probably anxiety. its ruining my quality of life and i just want tof eel normal i wont even leave my boyfriends side because im scared and hes the only one who understands i dont know what to do i am constantly weary about everything i do likewhat i eat/when i wat/excercise/walking etc "
Heart Attack,Triple bypass shock,"After being told a year ago my heart was fine following a stress test and having still had the tight feeling in the upper stomach on walking in the following months, I persisted and got another specialist to get me an angiogram 14 months later, I have been told I need a ttriple bypass. I am utterly devastated frightened and extremely fragile. I am so depressed and negative that I don't know I will manage to cope with the wait for the operation. Has anyone faced this type of shocking situation?"
Heart Attack,Mitral regurgitation and also Myelofibrosis.,"I have Dilated Cardiomyopathy with Mitral Valve regurgitation, and also Primary Myelofibrosis. My cardiac doctor is telling me I need Mitral Valve replacement. This is a big operation involving open heart surgery.However I also have high risk Myelofibrosis.This must increase the risk of having open heart surgery and as I don`t have any symptoms from my heart condition I wonder whether I should tell the cardiologist I don`t want to risk the operation at this time.I am aged 73."

Heart Attack,Unsolved Heart Symptoms,"Hello, I'm new to this forum and was wondering if anybody could help shed light on a problem I've been experiencing... I'm a 33 year old male and for the past year, I've been struggling with persistent shortness of breath, pvcs/irregular beats and chest tightness/pain, all of which are worsened by physical exertion. The shortness of breath/tightness never really goes away  but It gets so bad at times that I feel like I'm suffocating; it seriously intereferes with my daily routine. I've seen 2 cardiologists, they both did tests, and the second one had me on a month-long Holter monitor, did an echocardiogram, a stress test and a TEE procedure, but neither could find anything. Unfortunately the pvc/breathing symptoms have been getting worse and I'm having a lot of difficulty breathing most of the time, like I'm not getting enough air. When I was younger, I used to abuse adderall and drink, (which is when these symptoms first began appearing in a milder form) but I've been sober from alcohol for 2 years and haven't done adderall in 4 years. I also struggled with an eating disorder and was very sick because of it (ended up in the hospital). It's been a difficult journey but I've been recovering from that for about a year. These issues are all being dealt with and are under control now but I'm really afraid that I've done some kind of damage that the doctors haven't been able to find. The degree of discomfort I've been living with this past year has become unbearable and it severely limits my ability to get around...  I don't know what to do!

Heart Attack,Weird ECG pattern?,"I got issues with tachycardia and hard/heavy beating HR (even when not fast) for about 10 years. went to cardiologist, did some test and prescribe me beta blocker.I have omron hcg801 ecg handheld and recently i noticed weird different pattern on my ecg result. usually the p wave is higher followed by lower t wave but its the other way around.I record it when i was lying on bed, got sick. i wonder if the weird/different pattern due to a problem with my heart or if its a glitch/error. (but im not sure cause i tried to check again and the other results came out like the usuall except for those some result when i feel issues.)I ask a cardiologist if its a problem and he said no. but ive never noticed that pattern before untill last year. which is odd. so im confused and feel i need some inputs.I hope theres someone who understands about ecg who can give me some inputs.I would greatly appreciate it.Thank you for reading."

Was just about to start ivf when we found out we were having this little one. Last week at out 20 week scan we found out about baby having tof. Had LOTS of doctors talk to me about ending the pregnancy and telling me how this baby is going to be really ill. They have really scared me into thinking I'm going to lose him either before his born or after. I want this baby more than anything in the world but don't know how to take the news. Really need people to be straight with me and be a bit positive, if anyone has advice for me that would really help. Just need friends at the minute as my bf doesn't seem to want to talk about it ?"
Heart Attack,Chest pain during running,"Question: Does angina happen during extreme exercise to a healthy man without any heart disease/plaque build-up Background: While running when i am extremely tired and exhausted(after running for long time)  i feel pain in chest which is sometimes at left or mostly at right side of the chest. the pain goes away as soon as i stop running and doesn't return even if i start running after resting a few minutes. I can't say that it is heart pain as it is mostly at right side of the chest.   . note: The pain does NOT spread to other areas and i am just 16 years old with a healthy weight, active life style and i don't smoke/drink; it all makes any heart disease very unlikely."
Heart Attack,Can anxiety really cause reoccurring chest pain?,"I've been having sharp chest pains since Saturday morning. I had pain, got dizzy and my left arm went numb. That lasted 10 seconds at most. I was on vacation so I went to urgent care and had EKG done that was normal and saw my PCP today who said I was ok it was probably just anxiety or skipped beat but she scheduled a nuclear stress test within next 2 weeks to make sure.I've had 5 EKGs, an echocardiogram, and wore a 24 hour holter monitor all within the last 8 months; as well as bloodwork.I do have generalized anxiety and panic disorder but sometimes the pains just happen out of nowhere.  I also have GERD and some spine issues going on I'm seeing a neurologist for. Sometimes they can be exacerbated when I move my arm around or when I stretch my back or if I press on the area but 90% of the time they just come for no good reason. It can also happen in clusters. I can have it for days or a week and then not for weeks or months. It's at the top of my left breast mainly but can happen in different spots on my left side. It's been doing this off and on for months. Can it really be anxiety?Any input would be appreciated. Thank you! "

Heart Attack,"DOCTORS say heart is fine, sharp pains left side (chest, shoulder blade, arm, neck)","I had my heart checked about a month ago when I started to feel some pressure on my chest specially on my left side, was told it was just anxiety. I felt dizzy, weak, nausea, etc.Since then, I have MENTALLY and EMOTIONALLY improved drastically. Very positive regardless of what I have felt, dealt with a weak chest for the past few weeks, shortness of breath, lethargic, dizzy etc.I recovered mostly from that but I just started feeling a weird/tender/weak chest sensation, feeling random stabbing pains/shocks in left side of the chest, underarm area and just recently started to spread to my shoulder blades (like a weird burning sensation). Last night I felt dizzy along with the pains, felt muscular tension more than anything in the areas mentioned previously. Feel dead tired when sleeping with a weird sensation of nausea and cant catch sleep.I'm embarrassed to go back to the doctor. Should I hold out, and see how I feel? I just dont want to be surprised by a heart attack. I wonder if other people have gone thru this?"
Heart Attack,60 % LAD blockage management,After under going testing for constant chest pain lasting several months an angiogram showed a 50 - 60% stenosis in my LAD. All other arteries are clear. The cardiologist is certain my chest pain is not related to my heart because of my very high exercise tolerence - 18 mins on stress test I have been put on aspirin and statins and was wondering  with this medication and lifestyle changes whether is is possible to stop the plaque progression or am I heading for a complete blockage and heart attack?Would be interested to hear how people in similar position are coping and for how long?Thanks

Heart Attack,odd ecg readings...confused,Hey everyone im not sure if this is the right place to post.In 2012 I complained of chest pains and palpitations I went to the e.r. and they did an ekg which showed something to warrent a test for heart enzymes. Bloods came back normal but I got admitted to the heart ward with suspected heart enlargment. The next day I had an echocardiogram done which was normal. i got discharged as an out patient for a follow up nuclear purfusion scan which came back normal! Fast forward to 2016 I noticed fluid around my ankles and my doctor suggested a chest xray and echocardiogram. I had the echocardiogram and it was normal! This was 12 weeks ago. So yesterday I noticed my heart palpitating (as usual) but I got fed up with the feeling and went to my doctor. She did another ekg only for my piece of mind. Results were sinus tachycardi and lvh. The sinus tachycardi is due to my anxiety but with the lvh she crossed it out and stated my echo showed only 12 weeks ago that there was no thickening and this isnt possible. So I went to another doctor 2hrs later for repeat ekg same thing lvh with normal dinu s rythem plus something to do with nstemi and ekg unconfirmed. This doctor ordered blood test or inturn said I could go to the e.r. I chose the e.r. they did another ekg there about 45 after the second one and showed mild lvh and nothing to do with nstemi and no bloods nothing and said there were no signs of heart attack and believe the prevous echo done 12 weeks ago Is a good indacator that my heart Is fine. 4 out of 5 doctors dont seem worried. Im confused how the ekg can change some what from one warrenting blood test to the other giving no indication at all to warrent them. Sorry if I wasted any of your time. 
Heart Attack,Anyone got dilated cardiomyopathy following myocarditis?,"I developed myocarditis in feb 2016 following a chest infection in Dec 15. I had 3 hospital admissions with Arrythmias, spent a total of a month in hospital.

I am under 2 different hospitals, one where I first admitted and another where I had the MRI. Just received a copy of a letter sent to my GP from the consultant who saw me at the first hospital who hasn't seen my MRI saying I have dilated cardiomyopathy. This has not been mentioned before, I think he has based this on a recent ECG.

Heart Attack,"Heart 'palpitations', rapid beating/thumping. Had this occasionally since aged 12, now 55 years old","I have had these 'attacks' for want of a better word since aged 12 or 13, They happen occasionally, sometimes with very long periods in between, a year or so at times, usually several months gaps. It is like my heart suddenly goes ballistic, really fast, powerful beating, you can see my chest and skin reverberating and pulsing with the strength of them. Because of the 'rush' of blood, that's how it seems to me, it can cause momentary light-headedness, one a few odd occasions even nearly fainting.I have never actually blacked out, except for one time as a16 year old I almost did on a football pitch during a game once. I had one last summer when I also felt a bit nauseous, but I can't recall that ever happening before. Yesterday, I had an onset, and this lasted over and hour and a half, by far and away the longest this has ever been, although it was not as intense in it's strength as it has been with the other ones, usually they last a few minutes, though I have had some go on for 15/20 minutes in the past.I have had ECG while in the RNavy in my 20's and again when I came out in my early 30's, nothing detected, then again, why would it? The ECG was done while I was perfectly fine!I have always been sporty and active, I have a reputation for my endurance and hard-working nature at football and other activities, I go to the bottom of the tank and give my all. I have done endurance and assault course. cross-country endurance stuff and in the RN they would push you to your physical limits. I did Royal Navy Field Gun training. I have been very fit in my life and I am still in good shape now. I work hard still, as a self-employed mobile private gardener.So, this 'condition' has not disrupted of affected me or hindered me on that score, and aside from that one time as a 26 year old during a game, have never suffered this even at the most excruciating physical activities of the countless occasions I have been there! It mystifies me, to be honest!I am going to se my GP when I can get a chance, getting appointments down here is like trying to crack the combination of a high security bank vault sometimes! I won't go into detail with that, I'm sure I am not the only one to experience that with our modern NHS and GP practices, they all seem under so much pressure! They tell you to call between 8-9 in the morning, then it's always engaged (oh really? I wonder why?!) Then I go down there and there is like one person in reception! I ask to have an appointment, but can't get one for that day, I don't mind, but it's like the Krypton Factor and Mastermind combined trying to work through it! Lol!I said I wouldn't go into detail! I will keep trying with them however, it looks like I have no choice.Anything from anyone on here would be useful and most appreciated. ThanksTerry"

Heart Attack,I'm worried I'll have a heart attack,"Hello. So I'm 16 years old and recently my heart has been feeling weird. sometimes it starts beating fast with no reason, and other times it feels like it stops beating and I have to take deep breaths. I'm worried because of what happened to me yesterday: I went to the grocery store on my bike and I was pedalling very fast; when I arrived and walked in I almost fainted, I was taking deep breaths and I felt like my heart was going to explode and it hurt a lot. Also, I used to drink lots of redbull to stay awake in class and today I'm going to pass an exam that lasts 4h so I bought a 50cl can of monster. is it okay to drink? should I check if I have heart problems?

Heart Attack,Does alcohol reduce effectiveness of warfarin ?,"My best pal recently had open heart surgery resulting in a replacement valve & work to correct a leaky valve.As a result going forward he will be taking warfarin for the rest of his life.As things stand a couple of months after the operation his walfrin readings are very varied & keep going up & down.He has always enjoyed 3+ large glasses of wine each day and has continued a similar pattern post operation.Clearly this intake is way above the recommended 1.5 units for those taking walfrin.Notwithstanding the obvious impact of such daily volumes for anybody never mind someone having had heart surgery, I do have two specific questions:1) Could the alcohol be one of the reasons for the lack of stabilisation on his walfrin readings ?2) Could the alcohol actually have a negative impact on the effectiveness of the Walfrin ie causing increased risk of heart attacks ?I love my mate to death but am concerned that he may be in denial as to the impact of his continued drinking.Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
Heart Attack,Anxiety,"l have suffered all my life with Bi Polar and Borderline Personality Disorder. Every day when l wake up ( l'm lucky if l have more than 3 hours sleep any night ) but in the morning my nerves are shattered and shredded , l am shaking right through my inside and too petrified to move.  I always forced myself to get up and go to work up until l retired but still then had to fight this fear, terror, paralysing , crippling , horrendous nervous feeling !!!  I'm on so many drugs, l'm just about 70 and have been on meds since l was 15. I've had a bad heart for 30 years, l've had 2 major heart attacks with cardiac arrest, l've had a heart ablation where l had my extra electrical pathways Lasered out of my heart. I had a Triple Heart By Pass and my Main Aorta which was in a badly degenerating condition and my surgeon Mr Tang said it had been leaking for 20 years, he managed to salvage it( the alternative would have been a pigs valve) it is still leaking a tiny bit, 14 months after that my 4 th Heart Artery which was perfectly clear when he By passed my others was badly clogged and l had a Polylactide Biodegradable Scaffold inserted into it( the Scaffold is the newest most modern kind of Stent)The Cardiologists were flabbergasted that it had clogged up so badly in such a relatively shirt space f time.  l still  have Angina  and have medicine every day to prevent it. When l had my Triple By Pass Mr Tang had a Dialysis team in Theatre because l have EndStage 5 Kidney Failure, which has been getting worse over last 8 years. I have Kidney Dialysis every Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday afternoons 1pm to 6.30 pm. I also have bad Arthriis in my hips and knees and degenerated thinning of the discs in my spine, l've lost 2 inches off my height, l'm now 4'10"" small  !!! LoL. I've seen so many psychiatrists, psychologists,,CPNs, Counsellors, Doctors, Specialists , have so many drugs it just incredible but nothing rids me of the horrendous fear that ruins my life. I can cope with my Arthritis , My Heart Disease, My Kidney Failure, it may sound strange to be more frightened of illness in my head and nerves throughout my body than l am of potentially fatal,Heart Disease, l did die twice, l can live with terminal Kidney Failure, there is no cure, it's just having my life prolonged by a machine, this nay sound frightening to a lot of people especially people with needle and/or blood phobias like some if my fellow patients are, all that is easy for me even though our needles are massively long and wide and there is lots of blood. I'm so lucky that these things don't bother me. But the nerves that l have . The constant churning tummy, nausea( which is a CKD symptom anyway, it's just double trouble !!!  I can't go on living with these nerves,  l seriously think the only way to,rid myself of it is to commit suiciide !!!  It is that bad and my Paranoia which l recognise l suffer with, only makes it all worse because l think l'm worthless and no one would miss me. People talk about me behind my back and don't really like me. This extends t my Family and my Dialysis Nurses and fellow patients !!! I went to the Doctor ( l had never seen this one before) well as soon as l mentioned what was wrong he was rushing me out if the surgery, he stood up and opened the door waiting while l put my coat on and picked my bag up , l don't think l'd been in a minute !!!   The only thing that prevents me up to now from Suicide is the thought if failing, l'm so accustomed to,so many masses I of pills for my Bi Polar, my Heart, My Kidneys, my Blood Pressure and Arteries that l'm immune and l'd have to have enough to knock 6 Horses out ,) the fear of failure is what keeps me alive as well as my Dialysis. I'm not on the Transplant list, l hoped one of my children would offer me one just so that l could be magnanimous and say """" No Thankyou Darling you can keep your  Kidneys you may need them one day !!! But none of them have offered so l see how much they love me indeed.  "

Heart Attack,I occasionally see white streaks in my arms up to my shoulders that look like a vein,"Hey guys!I have been suffering from chestpain of unknown etiology for a few years now, and occasionally notice a white streak that runs up my tricep and wraps around my shoulder, leading into my body. Sometimes when I'm sitting or laying down, I'll notice I get this streak on both sides. (they are identically mirrored.) I'm assuming this is some variation of bad circulation, but I am a 25 year old healthy male. All bloodwork is normal, no markers, nothing.Any ideas?"

Heart Attack,My heart keeps skipping beats? ,"Hello everyone, Recently I have noticed my heart skipping beats. It then thuds and then speeds up, I then experience shortness of breath. Now, this has only happened 2/3 times this week. I am 20-years-old, relatively healthy, I don't smoke and I drink very little. But what concerns me is my family's history - My Father died of a heart attack at 54His Father died at 43 (pretty sure)My fathers Uncle and Aunt also died of heart attacks, and some other relatives too. Now as I am female it is my understanding that I have reduced risk. Also perhaps another mitigating factor is that this is all my Fathers side. On my Mothers side everyone is very healthy, no hereditary conditions that I can recall. The average life expectancy is around 90 years-old. I am a bit worried there is something wrong with my heart. I am aware that my Dads daughter (diff marriage) was born with a heart problem. Would anyone be able to advise me where I can go from here? I understand that this forum is not a diagnostic tool, neither do I expect people here to provide me with medical advice. Many thanks I advance. "

Someone help I always try stay healthy I'm 16 I play sports but lately I can't even walk round a supermarket with out feeling faint 
Heart Attack,how does heart pain feel?,Is it the surface of the chest or is it inside the chest?
Heart Attack,Exercise or not,"I have been told,that there is a 'Dip' in my ECG and they want me to go on medication leading up to a Angiogram,I have not  even decided if I will do this yet,as no pains in my chest,just feel a bit tired lately.I am  exercising like mad, but they are telling me to stop completly,why is this, I thought you had to exercise whatever ?"
Heart Attack,fluid on lungs ,"Hi been a while since been on site.At GP yesterdayOn spironolactone 50mg for three weeksStill got slight swelling of ankles and some fluid of lungs.She says it is cardiac in nature so is contacting cardiology again.She looked at my discharge letter from 28 months ago which said I had a ""sluggish""heart.I know at the time I had light left ventricle impairment.Term ""sluggish""was not mentioned.Anyone know what it means?"
Heart Attack,Any ideas as GP's have no clue,"Hi, 12 months ago had allergic reaction to antibiotics, heart went crazy and face swelled, At the time GP did several ECG's and said just missed/extra beats.  But 3 times since then have been to A&E convinced I was having a heart attack.  I am female and nearly 57.  All tests, bloods, scan, xray etc negative. showed nil heart disease, bloods excellent, but still having wacky symptoms and now due to have a 24 hour monitor which doctors believe will still show nothing. This is what happens, happily sitting relaxed when my heart will thump causing me to cough and catch my breath, my pulse then races - goes from resting 72 - 108 in seconds, pain in left underarm and stabbing pain all across chest, headache and reduced sensation in arms. Feel what can only be described as if I am slightly vibrating and go all whoozy.  This can last for days or just a couple of hours, last bout 10 days ago lasted 3 days was walking around feeling as if I was in a lift which kept going down, not sure how else to explain it.  In A&E hooked up to monitor doctor could tell heart was racing, but blood pressure fine, thought it may be thyroid, all tests negative.  X ray ok, bloods yet again ok.  The first doctor looked at me as it I was mad, the next one said ""sometimes there is no explanation, things just happen"" which is ok if we weren't talking about such a necessary part of my anatomy and one which I want to keep going for many years to come.  I am not anxious or a nervous person, do not have panic attacks, do suffer with GERD.  One thing different this time is lower calves all red and swollen with defined marks where socks have been.  Doctor loooked at the clearly hot red lower legs and shook her head saying it was nothing. Odeoma is a sign of hear problems I think, but as I have no heart disease why would this happen.  Am at a loss to know where to go from here and more importantly as the pains are so bad sometimes how on earth would I know whether it was a heart attack. I am just trying to relax and accept that there is nothing sinister going on, but just not knowing is frustrating."
Heart Attack,Heart palpitations,"Hi 2 days ago I was brought to A&E by my employer as I started to feel very unwell. I hadn't been feeling the best for a couple of days just felt slightly odd for want of a better word. But Saturday was different my heart was skipping beats a Few times a minute and racing and slowing I was also breathless and filled with fear. I also had random pains in my breasts and back not huge pains but like a dull ache or slightly burning feeling along with a pain in my right shoulder. They did x-rays,bloods and ecgs and said it was all normal. Even though I could feel the skipped beats for hours while lying in A&E. They discharged me and said they will follow up with a holster monitor..  Dr said it could be a panic attack but he's not convinced it was other than that he said if it happens again just let it happen only come back if it is accompanied with a lot of chest pain. I have continued to have random pains all around my chest area and my right shoulder is still sore but the skipped beats and racing heart has stopped. ps my mum died 7 weeks ago from svt"

These are my main symptoms:-Severe weakness in legs?-Dizziness?-Extreme nausea and projectile vomiting-Severe headaches?-More recently, difficulty breathing-Blurred vision-Depressed?My parents and I suspect that I may have some form of Bradycardia as my breathing is much worse and my heart rate is about 41 when it should be about 60, but we are not the experts.?My doctors and specialists have checked me for physical problems but I seem to be all clear. I am seeing a Cardiologist in a couple of weeks though.

Heart Attack,"Upper back pain, sternum pain, burning, and palpitations?","I'm an 18 year-old male and I have these symptom at times. The most persistent is upper back pain on my left side. It sometimes burns, sometimes a little stabby and it always happens at the worst when I inhale.When it's at it's worst, I have the upper sternum pain when I inhale along with the back pain, too. The palpitations happen randomly, but I don;t know if it's connected to the other symptoms.I have had 3 different doctors listen to my heartbeat with a stethescope and they said it sounded fine.  I have also had a chest x-ray and they reported I had ""no acute abnormalites"", just a slightly rotated spine.I'm afraid I have heart disease or something. I remember the first time I got the pain. I was eating a lot of brisket and my upper back started to burn. This was when I was 17. I decided to go running and it went away. It makes me think I was unhealthy for too long and developed a conidtion or something. I notice these things about it:1. When it's at it's worst, I have sternum pain when I breath in.2. Sometimes my chest feels like it's burning.3. It happens when I wake up, a lot now.4. It goes away when I exercise 90 - 95 percent of the time.5. Sometimes I can feel a little bit of the same pain on the right side of my back and chest but it's almost always on the left and a lot more severe on the left.Any ideas? Thanks in advance."
Heart Attack,Myocarditis - a year later & developing symptoms but test results ok,"Hi thereIn February 2015 I ended up in hospital with Myocarditis. On the Sunday evening I started to get a heavy pressure across my chest which then developed into really sharp pains. At that point I had a really hot flush and thought I was going to be sick. Thinking it was bad indigestion, I took some painkillers and Rennies and tried to get some sleep. The next morning I still had the pressure and a squeezing feeling in my arm so I went to A&E just to be on the safe side. My EKG, chest X-ray and blood pressure were all fine but my troponin levels were extremely elevated. They transferred my to another hospital where I stayed for a week and after an all clear angiogram, I was diagnosed with Myocarditis. I had an MRI which showed the inflammation was mainly around the heart pump function which was down to 65% function. I took rampiril for about 6 weeks to help but had to stop it as it brought my blood pressure too low and gave me an irritating cough. Since then I've been back to normal and feeling fine until last week. The pressure started again in my chest, my arm, a headache and sometimes I feel like someone is squeezing my wrists. I got checked out at the hospital and all of my tests came back fine. The doctor thinks I'm just worried it will return so the pain is just anxiety! I know my own body and there's definitely something not quite right. I've been fine until now and the only think I can think I've done differently is exercising harder than usual in the lead up to my wedding. Has anyone had any problems with exercising after having myocarditis? It would be good to hear from you if you have. ThanksJenna "
Heart Attack,how long for echocardiogram results? ,"Hi, I had an echocardiogram 5 days ago. Has anyone had one and if so how long for results? If there was a problem would I have heard back by now? "
Heart Attack,Jaw pain randomly and after exercise ,"Hello, I am 25 years old, female. I am slightly over weight but have been trying to get back in shape. I have a great deal of anxiety thinking I could possibly have a heart condition or will have a heart attack. I at times get jaw pain after exercise or even just randomly during the day. I also sometimes get chest pain when exercising, but the strange thing is that it isn't at the peak of my exercise or when I am exerting myself most. It's after when I'm just walking or walking at an incline and it doesn't happen everytime. It is sharp and on the left center side of my chest. Should I be worried? "
Heart Attack,Tests and more tests.,"Ok started with heart palps ranging from 3 to 15 a day for 3 weeks Jan 16.Then chest discomfort and the feeling that a small elephant was sat on my chest this lasted for around 3 weeks. During which pains down left arm and numbness left side. Went to A&E all tests clear, BP little high.Over last 4 months can't climb a flight of stairs or talk for more than 20 seconds without being shattered and needing a few mins to recover.Had chest X-ray all ok. Stress test ok. Just had echocardiogram ok, had 24hr blood pressure monitor average reading 155/116 been put on tablets. Still same symptoms. Waiting for 24hr ECG results to come back (5 weeks now).So if heart scans are ok wtf is causing this? Nan had angina in 30s, grandfather and his dad died 50s heart failure. But as I said my bloods and scans clear.34 yr old, average fitness 15st. Ex army (left 3 1/2 years ago). Never had any issues before."
Heart Attack,Should I be Worried About my Heart Rate ?,"Hi,I am a 35/36 year old Male, slightly overweight (BMI is about 26). My dad died aged 61 of a heart attack, and my excess weight seems to be mainly located in my stomach area, so I am quite worried about heart disease. I got myself a fitbit recently to measure my heart rate, steps walked and sleep every day. I changed from doing an office to job to something more active reading gas & electric meters about a year ago which so I walk on average about 13 KM every day on a weekday and much less at the weekend according to my fitbit. Occasionally (because it scares me and drains the battery) I have turned on the heart rate monitor. I have collected a few samples of what my heart rate looks like over different days, please see attached pictures.Should I be worried about anything shown in these graphs?  "
Heart Attack,Should I schedule an appointment with a cardiologist?,"I am a 35 year old man who is fairly active and in fairly good shape. Lately I have been noticing that I am getting tired and short of breath, especially after mild exertion. I am always feeling my heart pounding inside my chest, even when I am at rest. My resting pulse always seems to be above 100bpm. I will get hot, all of the sudden, and start feeling sick and start sweating. I checked my blood pressure today and it was 154/92. I also get dizzy and lightheaded all the time. I am not sure if my symptoms are really something to worry about since I am so young or if I need to make an appointment with a cardiologist. Heart disease does run in my family though. My dad has AFIB and congestive heart failure and my grandparents on both sides had heart disease. I think my issues have been happening since I was a kid. I used to get hot and sick to my stomach all the time when I would go with my family to theme parks. I couldn't play sports because I would get tired and start getting hot and sick again. I would like to find out what is going on with my health because something definitely does not feel right. I have also developed a cough that mostly comes on whenever I am short of breath. I can't even do cardio at the gym because I get short of breath and my chest starts to hurt a little. I have also experienced pain in the center of my chest as well as in my left arm and my left lower jaw on occasion. Do I need to consider seeing a cardiologist?  I also get headaches and have increased urination.  But my blood sugar is normal."
Heart Attack,feeling low and moody after my heart bypass,its been 6 months since my quad heart bypass in hammersmith hospital (7th march 2013) and all though im looking great and feeling healthy im suffering with the worst mood swings ever. they started shortly after my op but now im suffering with irratability and even some angry moments to the point of melt down.it doesnt matter what i say its the impact of what i am saying and how im feeling after i say these terrible things. my family have had enough.ive read that this can be normal after a bypass operation so i have googled forums but only seem to find sites based in america.the other feelings i have are regret and blame. im concidering organising my funeral now from fear of leaving everyone suddenly. the list is endless. my gp is checking my bloods as ive started some new meds recently but has anyone else had these experiances too? and how did you and your loved ones cope? i was 45 when i had my operation and going to cardio rehab really didnt help my mind state.
Heart Attack,revisit heart stents and next stages choices,"thanks for the informationsince last comments i have actually been back in for an angiogram and the results from that were the LAD is starting to narrow before the point of insertion, so they have gave me an option of trying another stent in the same artery or a CABGx1, but no mention of the erratic heart beat that instigated the investigation. to be honest very disolutioned with it all,my thoughts are to try another stent and hope it last longer than 9/10 months, i was under the impression and informed that artery take a life time to block, so wondering how in such a short space of time in can start to block in another place whilst under medication and diet or is it simply they have not inserted along enough stent in the first place, i am going back in for a echocardigram and that will be to make a decision i would think of next course of action, its taking a long time and work is also important and cant make any more plans as yet.Question how did you find the heart bypass x 2 were you alright, its very worrying"

Heart Attack,Heart attack or anxiety?,"Hi, I'm a 23 year old male, 5'10"" around 200lbs. Hispanic. For the past 3-4 days i've had chest pain, arm pain, and back pain. The chest pain felt like someone was squeezing my esophagus. It lasted about a minute but was quite scary. It happened once when I was driving and hasn't came back. Today i've been having a dull ache on the inner elbow of my left arm. Where the arm folds/creases. It's a dull ache that last a few seconds then goes away. I also have a slight pack pain that comes and goes, like someone is poking me. It's about mid section on the left side. There's also some sharp pains under the breast/rib cage, very brief. Lasts about a second. Could this be trapped gas?Could this be signs of a heart attack or anxiety? I've read so much on the Internet I don't know what I should do. I went to the Er in January because I thought I was having a heart attack. Did the EKG and everything was fine. I don't want to make another 4000$ trip to find it was just anxiety.."
Heart Attack,How do you know when it is heart related,"Hi, About this time last yearstarted having awful chest pains, palpitations, dizziiness, numb arms etc. had lots of tests which all came back clear, am 56 female and was told after a scan I have zero heart disease and problem likely to be gerd and costrocondritis.  Everything seemed to settle until earlier this week when again started with the palpitations, tingling left arm and pain going into hand, a really aching tingling pain different to pins and needles, also intermittent ear ache, last night had really bad central/left chest pain and was convinced I was having a heart attack, but as no sweating or sickness tried to calm down, but today not feeling great.  I am getting into a right pickle and worring would I actually know I was having a heart attack, the pain is so intense sometime surely a heart attack cannot be much worse. I will go back to GP next week but do not want to waste A&E time if nothing wrong.  Would a heart attack keep going on and on for days, coming and going, it is not affecting my daily life or my appetite, but you read so many stories than women's heart attack as so unlike mens and sometimes you have hardly any symptoms. Just wished these pains would go and I could stop spending my life worrying that today's my last.  Dramatic I know but that is how I feel"

Heart Attack,Complete Heart Block with Heart Murmur,"Hi there,My son (aged nearly 4) has a complete heart block and is due to be paced within the next few weeks.I'm slightly concerned about the consultant though for a couple of reasons. 1: He has been diagnosed as having a heart murmur by other doctors over the last few months, whereas his consultant stated in his latest examination that there was no murmur. Can murmurs come and go that quickly? I know they can come and go within a persons lifetime, but within such a short space of time?Also, the cause of my sons heart block is unknown. I had a tick bite that was removed very carelessly just before getting pregnant with my son, and have never been tested for Lyme Disease. I know this can pass through the placenta, and can cause heart block. Having mentioned this to my consultant, I believe I have been fobbed off with the excuse that antibiotics wouldn't do any good at this stage, whereas all over the internet there are cases of antibiotics reversing the effects even after a pacemaker has been fitted!Any advice is welcomed!Thanks,Emma"

All day I still couldn't eat it feels like there is something stuck in my oesophagus and on Saturday I still hadn't been able to keep food down and still the same pain but when I woke up I was unable to move my arm for a good while I thought I had slept on it funny but I waited a while and the strength never came back so I went to the hospital and they did ECG blood and chest X-ray examination etc.. but nothing I was given codeine for the pain but had an odd reaction to it so  Sunday, even more, pain and I feel like I've done a lot of exercise like all my muscles hurt called 111 to have an out of hours doctor but they said no and sent  paramedics around again and they still found nothing abnormal apart from low blood sugar which isn't surprising at this stage as I haven't eaten since Thursday  so its Monday my doctor has no appointments for weeks and I tried to register with  a new one but I have to wait 48 hours and I feel so weak and haven't slept properly  I have work tomorrow and don't know how I'm going to cope So in Summery, I have sharp continuous chest pain, weak left arm vomiting, unable to keep any food down, muscle ache and lethargy and random heart palpitationsnot sure what other information to mention"

Heart Attack,"Nausea, Sweating, Faint. Cardiology Related???","Hi all,Last night i woke up with nausea and slight discomfort feeling in my stomach. I then started to sweat profusely, my whole body was saturiated and i felt very clammy but I would not say i was hot or overheating. I did not vomit, as i felt that i would not be able to make it to the toilet, as i was worried about losing consciousness and did not feel i had the strength to move. Therefore i stayed in bed and fought the urge to vomit. No shortness of breath or chest pain. The whole episode lasted 5 minutes.I had a similar episode 2 months ago with exactly the same symptoms, however and that occasion i did vomit.  The following day after both episodes I felt fine (about 85%) with no loose bowel movements, loss of apetite.I am a 31 year old male, excercise 5 times of week (5-10km runs and weight training) and consider myself generally fit. Family history of Pulmonary Embolism, cousin and grandfather died aged 44. FH of stroke, aunty aged 67.Could this be cardiology related?Any ideas, similar experinces or feedback would be great,Thanks."
Heart Attack,Heartbeat over 100 bpm,Just recently i have notice my heart rate goes over 100 bpm and i had a particularly bad 'attack' today.  I was walking along as normal and suddenly i felt my heart started racing and i started to feel as if my breathing was going to stop.  What could be causing this?
Heart Attack,Might havw serious blood vessel problems in my lower left leg and foot,"Hi. Ive always assumed ive had restless leg syndrome for over a decade in my left leg but in the past couple of weeks it has become concentrated in the bottom part of my leg and particuarly my foot. It used to twitch quite often but now it's like a constant throbbing/dull pain and its really starting to worry me. I did ring my doctor today but was unable to speak with me until tomorrow. Just to be clear i do have a serious dependency to benzodiazepines but they actually made my ""restless leg symptoms"" go away but now its back and its alot worse. I am fairly certain these symptoms are happening in my blood vessels like high blood presuure or something like that, at least thats what it feels like. Any advice? Ive considered ringing an ambulance because it really feels like this could be a serious thing. Thanks"

Heart Attack,Odd Heart Rhythm,"Hello! I was looking for some advice on a weird thing. When I was about 13 or 14 or 15 (I'm now 20), there was an incident where my heart rate briefly seemed to go a bit odd. I had been doing some kind of exercise which left me out of breath, and for some reason I then decided to lie on my bed with my legs on the wall, and my body at such an angle that I was essentially upside down (I hope that makes sense, it was a while back and I don't recall it perfectly). I happened to put my hand across my heart, and noticed that it was beating in an unusual rhythm. It would beat very fast, then skip a couple of beats, then there would be precisely two beats in quick succession, then another skipped beat, and then it would go back to beating very fast. It returned soon enough to a normal rhythm, and I didn't think anything of it at the time, I just thought it was kind of fascinating. Skip forward five or six years, I'm a much more anxious person, and the memory of it has been bothering me recently. I don't think it sounds a very normal thing for the heart to do. I haven't noticed it happening at all since that time, but I suspect it might be worth going to see a doctor about? I had a basic five minute ECG test done a couple of years ago after I had some breathing difficulties, but it came back fine and the breathing got much better the less I panicked about it. I'm especially worried because I'm going to have an operation on Monday which I think requires me to be under general anesthetic, and I've been nervous about that and wondering, if I did have a heart problem, whether the anesthetic would interfere with it. It's all just making me a bit troubled.   "

Heart Attack,possible blocked heart arteries,"Back in 2007 I had my Aortic valve replaced. The procedure went very well and I've had a perfectly normal lifestyle since. I haven't been to the Cardioligist for a year and lately have started having burning, twitching aching , twitching feet and hands, guiding me to believe this is some sort of circulation problems. I am scheduled to see my Cardioligist in early March, but was wandering if the Aeurothepy problem could be a possible blockage in my heart from arteries. I have had no symptoms of anything going on with my heart, but since I had the valve replacement, it never hurts to ask.  Thank you!!"

Heart Attack,Can't get diagnosis. ,"I am 28 years old with known high blood pressure and cholesterol. I am experiencing warm sensations in my legs and throughout my body. My feet get ice cold and I have these warm sensations in my head and it almost feels like I can feel my blood flowing through me. I get chest pains and fullness periodically and if I press on one of my veins I get that liquid like sensation and tingling throughout. I had an echocardiogram done and my heart looks ok aside from the fact that I have tachycardia. I'm concerned that there is something vascular going on. My doctor said the pulses in my feet were low so I had a Doppler done and that was clean. The constant head pain and fullness is concerning along with the warm sensation. At times it feels like I am tasting blood, and I am short of breath. I feel like my doctor us just going to dismiss this because I'm going but these symptoms never seem to go away."

Heart Attack,Aortic Regurgitation,"a cardiologist told me yesterday I have a leaky aorta. He asked me if I had symptoms such as heart racing, feeling tired easily chest pain etc.  I said there were some but always put down to hypothyroid, anxiety etc and I thought I was fine - walked 2 or 3 miles on weekends with dogs etc. When I've had time to think I realise I have quite a few aches etc that are different to my usual aches - sometimes feeling more like muscles are tired after exercise - this is in my legs. Also feel I now have questions but don't know how to get them answered. He wS going to look closer at my scan results and, depending on what he sees, either sign me off for my gall bladder op or send me for further tests. I'm not sure how to get my questions answered now - anyone have any advice? "
Heart Attack,"My Father Expired after Angioplasty, still dont know how","My Father had a heart attack on 1st december at 4pm, but he did not had any other diseases (no BP, No diabities) because of that initially he did not believed that it is a heart attack. while we made him to go hospital for check up after 6 hours at 11 pm , blood reports and ECG showed heart attack (trop i and ckmg) but he was totally fine. treatment started with initial blood thinners and other injections. doctor told to have angiogram at that moment. He did not agree and had a argument there and made us take him home instead.Next day again we requested him and made him agree for second opinion. We went to fortis escort heart institute. they confirmed it is a heart attack and started their treatment. They kept him in observation he was totally fine that day and was feeling ok , but doctor told us to have angiogram. we and doctor made him agree for that and next day morning he had that done. which showed blocked LAD and rest arteries are totally fine. Doc did not gave us any option like we can keep him on medication etc. he directly did the angioplasty and drug eluting stent was placed in mid LAD. Father came out of the cath lab at 10.30 feeling OK and he was OK till 1pm as mentioned he got hypotensive and then at 3.30 he became unstable and had cardiac arrest while they took him from icu to cath Lab. they revived him but again he had cardiogenic shock and expired at 8.30 on 3rd december.we are devastated as already we had already some problems in family and out of sudden we lost our loving father. He was OK while he walked towards the hospital did not had any problem but after angioplasty he did not lived. I am not from medical background but just wanted to know was there any possibility we could have saved our father ?if no Angioplasty would have done , as it was past one day and more the heart attack came and he was alright.He was a very innocent ,hardoworking and caring person. never did anything wrong with any one. We as a family do miss him and i feel guilty that i was not able to save him.We would have saved him only on medicines ?EF showed 35% post PTCA .please some one let me know , sorry for the bad grammar. "
Heart Attack,Ekg,"I had an ekg done in which i was told it showed i had a pacemaker. I do not have one. While in the hospital, i was given blood thinners and put on a cardiac diet just to be told it was all a mistake with no record of the ekg and im so confused how this happened. "
Heart Attack,Difficulty breathing and lightheadedness and dizziness,"n August while conditioning with my college softball team I experienced shortness of breath, dizziness, and could feel my heart racing and felt like I was going to pass out. I thought it could possibly be my heart but I also thought maybe I was paranoid because my mom was currently in the hospital for an inflammation on her pericardium and my dad had previously had a stint put in his heart. I've always experienced shortness of breath during exercises but I always figured I had asthma or something. But In November I also experienced a little chest pressure and burning in my chest so I decided to go to my doctor. I found out I had WPW syndrome. I then went to see a cardiologist. He ran a stress test and did a ultrasound. He didn't find anything on the stress test, and nothing really on the ultrasound, but he did say it looked like my mitral valve was buckling a little bit but he didn't think it could be causing me any problems. He then out me on a cardiac event monitor for 21 days. From that he determined he didn't think my WPW syndrome was what was causing my symptoms, so something else was going on. He then sent me to get blood drawn to do a CBC, complete metabolic panel, and TSH. He didn't find anything besides I'm slightly anemic, not enough to be causing my problems. Last time I saw him he said he's gonna set me up with an electro physiologist and get his opinion and see what he says and if we get nothing from him, than we'll do a CT of my heart. Does anybody have any idea what could be wrong with me? Please help me."

Heart Attack,Abnormal ECG,"Hello!Yesterday I came back from staying the night at the hospital.  I'd been having minor chest and left arm pains, and they kept me in overnight to be safe.  While there, they performed blood tests, swab tests, and a couple of ECG's, and while the blood tests did come back clear, the ECG's were abnormal, indicating that my heart might not be getting all the blood it needs. But the doctor also did say that, with nothing to compare to, that might be my 'normal'.Could anyone advise what this means? They didn't explain massively. I plan on getting myself to the doctor this week. Thanks!"

Heart Attack,anyone had pain after angiogram apart from the normal ones ?,"Hi there i had my fourth angiogram in september 2012 ,they did it in my left arm and the artery was too small to get the tube in and it hurt so much despite the numbing of my wrist they then injected a widening solution into my artery and said you may feel a bit of a tingle my god i felt like i was being electrocuted all over my body nasty really nasty ,after about 3 months i started to get the most severe arm pain now and again and its over a year now and the pain is getting to the point of i want to cry and i am pretty tough i am terrified to tell the doc as they may send me for another angiogram and i truly could not bear the pain of another one especially as i use a walking stick in that hand and have a bad leg and they would only have my groin to go in and its been gone into on my right side ,has anyone had anything like this please thank you ,"
Heart Attack,"Sinus Tachycardia, Need some Reassurance ","This has been bothering me for three months now. I'm 18, never smoked, taken drugs, or alcohol. I'm inactive, but otherwise healthy. So, one night, my heart began to beat at 130 bpm and I had to go to the toilet many times throughout the night. The next day it was down to 100 bpm and then the day after that to 90 bpm and that's where it has been for the last three months pretty much.It lasts all day, only when I go to sleep it's 60 bpm, and every test came back good, ECGs, ultra sound, x-ray, blood test... except that on the blood test it showed I had Free T4 of 26 when the range is 11-24, so my cardiologist suggested the heart racing was caused by my hyperthyroid which would also explain why I had to go to the toilet often, as it's increased metabolism.But I'm an anxiety person so I worry about heart attacks and so on could anyone tell me what they know about this and what my chances are of having a heart attack because of this I'm kinda worried but I guess for no reason?"

Heart Attack,"Very worried about my husband, who just had a heart attack","Hi everyone,My husband is 43 years old.  Over this past weekend, he developed gradually worsening chest pain and then developed nausea and vomiting.  He finally couldn't take it anymore and went to the ER, where he was admitted for a chest pain rule out.  He is diabetic and overweight and has a family history of cardiac disease (his mother had her first heart attack right at his age).  His EKGs and troponins were all completely normal, but his magnesium was critically low at 1, so they repleted it with IV magnesium.  He had a Lexiscan stress test this morning, which showed that he, in fact, suffered a heart attack.  His ejection fraction on the right was 55% and on the left was, I believe, around 45%.  Tomorrow morning, they are taking him to the cath lab to see exactly what is going on and to see if they can do anyhing there to help him.  If they can't I guess the next step is a bypass, which we are praying won't be necessary.  Both my husband and I work in healthcare, but we are not cardiologists and we are not experts by any means.  Has anyone been through this before?  I'm a complete mess and worried sick over this.  My husband is my best friend and I just want him to be okay.  Can anyone offer any words of advice or encouragement?  "
Heart Attack,Palpitations and often chest pain ,"For the last couple of months I've been getting palpitations - feeling like my heart is skipping a beat, or has an extra beat, and I've been having chest pains. I've had an ecg, it didn't show anything-but I think that's because I wasn't experiencing chest pains or palpitations during the ecg, which only lasted for a few minutes. My doctor hasn't decided to carry out anymore tests, but I'm becoming more and more worried... What should I do? "
Heart Attack,Innapropriate Sinus Tachycardia ,I have been diagnosed with IST. At first they put me on anxiety medicine and then added propranolol.  I gained weight and was so exhausted all the time.  I finally stopped the anxiety meds and felt much better. I slowly started tapering off propranolol also. I have read that it is okay to have a faster heart rate. That you can live a healthy normal life and that it is not life threatening. I feel so much better and have energy. I felt numb on the medicine because it blocks your adrenaline. Now...I can actually feel excited and happy again. My heart rate has increased and sometimes just walking and cleaning house it goes up to 126 or 132. When I sit down it goes to 80's. It probably has always did this and i just didnt notice before. Does anyone else suffer from this? I have read that you don't have alot of options while having IST. Either meds or none. I am choosing none. The side affects are horrible. If anyone has any suggestions to help...I would appreciate.
Heart Attack,"I had a tachycardia episode 6 days ago and still don't feel right, any idea what could be wrong?","On sunday evening I started to feel slightly off in my chest, within 20 minutes my heart rate was 140 and I was shaking so we called an ambulance. Since then my heart rate has been up and down, resting at about 100. The hospital said I would most likely develop the flu as my urine and blood tests came back clear and my ECG looked fine. Over the next few days i was admitted again, as i was feeling breathless again and started with a slight pain the right hand side of my chest near my heart, and slight pains in my leg. Once again, everything came back fine. No deficiencies etc. I feel dizzy and lethargic all the time, even though last night my heart was at 60 I still felt incredibly weak and off in my chest. My heart has been really fast in general and I've felt very breathless. It has been 6 days now since I started, but I still feel unwell in my chest, and no flu symptoms! They completed urine tests, blood tests, echocardiograms, took my blood pressure and monitored me again but nothing has come up. My heart is healthy aside from a slight murmur and my oxygen is 100%. But i am bed bound. More recently I have felt slightly more energetic but my resting heart rate is still about 100-110bpm and I have this odd fluttering sensation just at the base of my sternum. Feels like a muscle spasm that lasts a few seconds and it comes in episodes of about 5 mins with a few minute break between each one. This fluttering has been happening for two days now. I went to the doctors yesterday to try and get some help and despite her being quite dismissive, she agreed to get a 24 hour heart monitor ordered which i will have sometime next week. Has anyone ever dealt with something like this before? Am I going to feel like this for a while?Thanks."

Heart Attack,Martial Valve Repair,"Hi all,I had my martial valve repaired when I was 11. I have a ring in my martial valve to reduce leakage. I am now 28. I started playing badminton when I was 19. Now I go jogging for 35 minutes  (1 min rest for every 5 min jogging  ).  My hearbeat reaches upto 150 bpm. Then I do pushups, bumbbell bench press situps for around half an hour. I take rest after every 2 days of exercise. After performing exercise I fell good the whole day. But, on the day i exercise, I can feel that my heart beat becomes slightly more when I go upstairs than on rest days. My heart used to pain in the beginning but nowadays I do warmups properly and heart doesn't pain. But i am always afraid and I don't push myself when I exercise. I always wanted to build my body. Is there any thing that I can do so i could lift like a normal person. Regards , Praveen Shrestha "
Heart Attack,"Cancer, chemo, radio, cardiomyopathy ....

This unfortunately can be anything more than a gentle walk and I've put on so much weight ..I went to a dietician last week, my final hope.

I eat fruit, veg fresh everyday don't take sugar, nothing seems to work and I feel very down ... I don't know how to tackle this but feel if I don't, I'm inviting the cancer to come back and I'll have no one but myself to blame ! Any help is greatly appreciated ... Thank you "

Heart Attack,High Cholesterol ,"Hi all,This is a first for me on this forum.   I just have a couple of questions I'd like to ask.    Firstly,3mths ago I had a blood test that revealed that my cholesterol was 7 and due to having a heart attack 6yrs ago my GP advised me to go on statins,but because I'm on such a lot of other meds I didn't really want anymore.  She suggested I try Avastatin for 3mths to see how I got on with it,but once on statins you can't come off.Secondly, After 3mths I had another blood test which revealed my cholesterol at 5. But I'm told once on you have to stay on them.WHY.?      Why can't you come off them and start to control it with food?     I really don't want to be on all this medication,some are a matter of life or death,but I've been put on no end of meds that I'm now struggling to get off.Anyone got any answers?"
Heart Attack,Aspirin can save a life. Where is a convenient place for a man to carry?,I carry around aspirin in case I get chest tightness or tingling. As I'm getting older I want to be proactive about what can happen. Aspirin could have been the saving factor in my neighbors life as he suffered from a heart attack.Does anyone have a convenient place to carry these pills on themselves so they won't become damaged or lost?
Heart Attack,Worried,"Hi,I am a male aged 52 , for more years than I can remember I have had a fast pulse and what I think are occasional missed beats  or an irregular beat. I went into hospital a couple of years ago with kidney stones and they picked up on high blood pressure and tachycardia. The did a few ecg's but never said there was a problem, ny bp did come down though.I also a year later went to my GP's with a stye on my eye & the practice nurse said it was time they did a general health check. I said my BP would be high ( I am anxious in clinic) and it was high, they checked my pulse and this was also fast, they an ecg and a doctor in the next room said it was fine ""just fast"". They took bloods and all came back fine , just a little high on cholesterol. They agreed I did home BP readings twice a day and record them , most of the readings when rested were between 125/80 & 141/94. But even with the lower readings the pulse is nearly 100.I work in a hard physical job and I never have any problems doing so, I also never have any chest pain. I am always frightened to have my vital statistics checked as I am extremely fearful of having to undergo surgery as I had a patent ductus arteriosis reparied as a 5yr old child which left me frightened of heart surgery. I have silently put up with these paliptations for over 25 years due to my fear of doctors.Apart from the what I see as missed beats/arrythmia? and occasional high bp I always feel fine & am always able to work hard, I can carry heavy equipment up many flights of stairs and work for hours without proble,m. If I ""was"" to see my GP , what could I expect to happen. "

Heart Attack,odd sensation / brief dull pain,"Hi,i'll try to be concise !  for the past 3 years or so I have been having a bit of a struggle with my doctor to get certain symptoms investigated (tingling in legs, extreme fatigue) - with effort I have been given blood tests for diabetes, had a liver scan & also seen a rhuematologist - so far no one has confirmed what is causing this & I have to keep pushing to be given other tests. Despite having right bundle branch block at no time has anyone checked my heart & my blood pressure has only been taken twice, at the start of all this. Anyway, the fatigue & leg symptoms have got worse & now I, more or less, spend much of the time having to rest & not doing much.a couple of weeks ago I felt a dull pain in my chest for about a second, along with a sensation I can only describe as a feeling of being pulled backwards from the point in my chest where the pain was - a bit like being winded but in the chest rather than the stomach / lungs. Since then this has happened a few more times & I'm rather worried as to what it could be.  It seems to me that given that i'm already unwell I should be able to have some tests done on my heart to find out what this could be - if indeed it is anything to do with my heart, but I get the impression that my doc has, more of less, decided that either my other symptoms are undiagnosable or that lots of it is psychological (it definately isn't !). has anyone on this forum had a similar chest area symptom or know what it might be ? to someone who hasn't had heart problems before it feels a bit like my heart blinking out or something !"
Heart Attack,"Have  low ejection fraction, too.","My ejection fraction is 34% down from 50% a year ago, taken by 2D echo from the same lab.  Any suggestions what I can do to raise it?  Right now I do aerobic exercise via stationary bike 30 minutes a day 5 to 7 days a week.  Eagerly awaiting suggestions.  Thanks."
Heart Attack,"Ectopic beats, narrow complex tachcardia","Help.  I have had ectopic beats for many years, but recently have started having palpitations practically every night, resulting in no, or very little sleep, due to anxiety and panic (therefore, I suspect leading to a viscious circle).  This morning I received a letter saying that the automatic detection algorithm picked up bursts of narrow complex tachycardia.  Should I be on medication asap for this?  thanks for your help."

I'm a non smoker who, 22 years ago beagan to experience swelling in my left leg from top to bottom; it feels warm and hard and is without pitting. I was referred to a specialist who advised that he needed to see it ""in action"" so to speak however this was impossible as it never occurred when I wanted it to (usually atcollege/ work).

Heart Attack,Could sudden death have been prevented?,"The patient was a friend who has died. She had very recently been diagnosed with aortic stenosis. She had been discharged from hospital  with a number of outpatient appts. and was expecting to have heart surgery but the date had not been fixed. Her flat was on the first and second floor. Due to the diuretics she had to visit the toilet often whcih meant a rather tiring trip upstairs.

Heart Attack,What is an enflamed left ventricle,"i just had a lab test that points to an inflamed left ventricle. I am 65 years old,female. They asked me for another blood test as they said the last one could have been a false positive. I just went this morning so I assume results may be ready by Friday or Monday. All I can find is that it may mean an enlarged heart, not good. I do have high BP and diabetes, both if which I am on medication for. Does anyone have any knowledge of what an inflamed left ventricle could mean? I know I had an icschemic heart attack many years ago but they did I not seem concerned about it. Thank you."

Heart Attack,Still waiting for answers,"I was diagnosed in November I still to this day don't know what is wrong with me. I have been in hospital 4 times over the last 10 months and all they keep saying is ""well it's not a heart attack, your heart isn't scarred and your arteries are clear"" But I still keep getting all the systems that I had in November when they decided I had HF. I still get immense pressure in my head so I'm still sleeping sitting up even though the HF  clinic said I shouldn't be.

Heart Attack,heart,"At a gp appointment after the  doctor listened to my chest she said i had a slight heart murmmur ,i was wondering can it get worse over time? "
Heart Attack,Something not right.,"My problems started recently after taking a statin, Ive since, felt muscle tenderness and weakness aswell as dizziness, out of breath at times when speaking, very hot flushes and a raised heartrate while the flush occurs, I havent been able to exercise as jusst walkin seems to send my heart rate into overdrive, Im also getting chest pain particularly on my left side. Im also getting flushes in my toe. I can also feel water on my chest.Problem is these things sort of come in spells, and are not always present.I honestly believe its cardiomyopathy as my muscles are weak in themselves.Ive been to a&e once before taking the statin panicking now from then on they think its all anxiety, my heart rate was 140 bpm, then 100, they took two ecgs when they told me they wouldnt take one and then got onto the phone with a consultant who said no further action needed, probably because they think its anxiety, anyway, I literally cant live like this, had blood tests came back fine, but showed my kidney working hard now its improving, but I literally feel dizzy and weak even lying down on the computer.The other day i measured my pulse and there were lots of skipped beats that had me taking breaths in my throat like catching breath, when i mentioned this at a &e they said it was normal they refuse to do more tests."
Heart Attack,Side effects of Candestartan,Morning all.  Has anyone out there experienced any side effects of Candesartan?  I won't mention anything specific.
Heart Attack,Verapamil ,"Hi I'm30 years old 3 weeks ago I woke up to a fast heart rate went to the er and first they put me on Metaprolol and it caused me to have severe panic attacks , dizzy and my vision was messed up and chest pains went  to er a couple days later they told me it was just anxiety and heart burn. Then my heart rate went up again because my doctor took me off the Metaprolol and again at the er this time they put me on verapamil 80 ml 3x a day I was still having chest pain dizzy and then got more symptoms I was feeling short of breath weak muscle pain not being able toSleep. So I went to my pc toldHer what was going on and she was telling me these are none of the side effects of the medication and I can't keep flip flopping on medicines. That night I couldn't sleep I finally had it so I call the cardiologist and tell him I've not slept in well over 30hrs finally he calls me back after taking my 4pm dose and tells me to stop taking it I was so relived but wish they called a bit soon before I took that dose. Crazy thing was about 20mins after taking the verapamil this time I broke out in a rash, my heart was burning along with my body im so happy to be off that medication I managed to sleep couple hrs last night and this morning. Does anyone know how long the side effect last after you have stopped taking it I was on it a week I'm still dizzy and not hardly any sleep thank you so much. "
Heart Attack,Ivrabradine and side effects,"Hi AllI am a 58 year old man (heart attack 3 years ago) and i to am on 2.5 bisoprolol and have none of these symptoms whatsoever lucky me.However i am also on ivrabradine and have been for 12 months which i have just stopped taking 3 days ago due to real nasty side effects which are exactly the same symptoms as a panic attack.I have never had a panick attack in my life before but 2 weeks ago after a walk which i normally breeze through suddenely out of the blue felt absolutely terrible,tight chest dizzy headache nausea and felt like i was going to drop dead there and then it was that bad.30 minutes or so later i was back to myself as though nothing had happened,after a researching the symptoms i had i thought it was a panick attack until i read the possible side effects from ivrabradine and they were virtually exactly the same,these attacks then continued for 4/5 days not as bad as the first but still bad enough.When my stents were being fitted the surgeon said to me how long have you suffered with angina and i said to him thats news to me didnt know i had it as i had never had any chest pain in my life apart from the odd chest infection which would dissapear after anti biotics well he said you have angina.To cut a long story short after 2 years i still didnt know what angina was as i had no chest pains.Then i went for my 6 monthly check up with my cardioligist and he did the usual checks took my pulse listened to my chest blah blah and he said your pulse is a little quicker than i would like it to be and he stuck me on the ivrabradine,after approx 2 months of taking ivrabradine i started to feel tightening of the chest which lasted around 5 mins or so which i then thought was the angina and thought nothing about side effects of any of the medication i was on.It is only early days since i stopped taking ivrabradine but i feel so much better and optomistic, these horrible attacks have started to subside,i am so sorry to change the subject relating to bisoprolol but if this post can help anyone who is suffering anything similar whilst on ivrabradine please think about an alternative beta blocker,my beats per minute at rest can be down to as low as 48 bpm without beta blockers and 70 bpm whilst walking around,in hindsight i wish i had told my cardioligist that 10 minutes prior to my appoitment with him i had just walked up a steep hill on my way to see him."
Heart Attack,Chest Pains,"Hi to everyoneI am 50 years oldI have had a heart problem since 2008, this is when I had my first heart attack. The doctors told me that I had a genetic problem with the left side of my heart. I had a stent put in, unfortunately this failed after about 8 months. Unfortunately, there was not much else they could do at that time as the artery showed the problem of it splitting if thet tried to stent again. I was asked if I wanted a by-pass, I weighed up the options and said no. This was mainly because the consultants could not give me a high enough chance of it succeeding. This was 6 years ago and I am still here.I use to go to the hospital regularly, because of my chest pains. I don't no more, as I feel a bit of a fraud because they either say they can not see anything or they turn round and say there is nothing we can do to give you a better life.Anyway, my chest pains have become different, they start at where my heart is and go round to the back of the chest. My jaw is okay, as well as my teeth and left arm. The strange thing is is that if I have a hot drink, this tends to help it. Is this angina or just indejestion????"

Heart Attack,Finding it difficult after my husband's heart bypass,"We have only been married a short while, and 3 weeks ago my husband suffered a heart attack and needed bypass surgery. i adore my husband but find his mood swings difficult when he's shouting at my children( this is not him at all!)... I feel my world is crumbling, our family holiday has been cancelled, we are due to move house shortly and now the mortgage company are refusing to pay until he is back full time in work.( we are currenttly renting and been given notice by landlord also)...i feel it's such a mess....any one else experienced this....???"
Heart Attack,coarctation of aorta,"Hi, i was diagnosed very late with this condition. An acute GP noticed the murmer and was not convinced that all was normal. Test after test later it was confirmed.  Months later i had a stent fitted  which is 4cm x 2cm, I was not warned about the amount of brusing or the pain in the legs, 4 months later i am still having pain in the groin and the che chest.  The cardiologist does not know why I have this pain that travels from my chest to my back and laft arm.  MY left leg feels heavy and numb down to the foot which is freezing cold at times again.  I have started feeling tired and fed up with the whol ordeal. Yes i know i needed this procedure but through choice i would never have had it - my active happy go lucky life style now revolves around this.  When i get ill My poor GP has to send me in to the hospital as they are not well versed with this condition.  Can any one tell me when will I feel well and strong again.  Do you get back to normal?  The hospital and the doctors have been wonderful but they just do not have the answers.  They think it could be damage due to the surgery but not lifr threatening so at least that is something to be cheerful about.  I would love to hear from other people that have undergone similar treatment."

Heart Attack,Cramping heart,"After months of complaining about heart problems finally saw cardiologist today who said that during a stress test on treadmill my heart showed cramping, he said it may be a blocked artery stopping blood flow, so I now have to have a CT scan. Some docs are easy to question others just look at you, I did not feel able to ask as many questions as I wanted, did ask if I was likely to be more at risk of heart attack or stroke he said no more than anyone else. I am due to fly in 2 weeks time and he said no problems just don't lift heavy cases (why?) he also said that as my risk was low not to worry as this test shows this in a lot of women due to breasts? He has given me asthma tablets to slow heart rate down for scan, but what side effects will they give me? Feel worried as I am 56 overweight with a bmi of 34 and due to having reflux and diverticular (god I sound unhealthy) struggle with diet, so anyone else have this, if so what did you change or add to your lifestyle to help?

Heart Attack,Indigestion and Ectopic beats?,"Hi, my name is Arya, I'm 27 years old. So for the past year I have been experiencing horrific panic and anxiety attacks. I've had blood work done, ecgs - all came back fine and I'm a completely healthy young woman, I saw a cardiolgist a few weeks ago, she told me that I suffer with something called Ectopic heartbeats and that they're really common and normal. My question is, are these so called harmless beats linked to indigestion?I have a nervous stomach all the time due to my anxiety, I don't get these beats often but when I do I notice I have a lot of gurgling and grumbling, I questioned my doctor about it and he said it had nothing to do with it, but I'm not so sure... Anyone have any thoughts about this?"

Heart Attack,"8 months post heart attack, medication reactions or heart symptoms?","After having a heart attack last October I still feel quite worried. I do not want to live at the drs. I do not know how much of my symptoms and pains are from side effects from the meds I take. I am on aspirin 75, clopidogrel,bisopronil, ramapril and a gut protecting med. I have 2 frozen shoulders( I know this was from the statins , now discontinued) excessive sweating bouts, embarassing bruises everywhere, low mood and sharp regular stabbing pain in my left breast, does not seem related to breathing. Is anyone experiencing similar symptoms?"
Heart Attack,Echo has me worried,"Hi I started experiencing palpitations last winter. It feels every now and then like an extra strong beat in my heart which leaves me a bit breathless. I went to the hospital with it last December as it had become quite frequent. They did an echo and blood tests and everything seemed normal. But they made an appointment for me to get an echo and a 24 hour holter monitor for this month. Anyway I had my gall bladder removed in April and ever since I woke up from the surgery my heart rate has been extremely low usually in the 40s-50s while sitting down. They did blood tests and a contrast ct of my heart and said nothing was wrong with my heart and put it down to my thyroid and upped my eltroxin. It didn't really help my rate. Since then I am exhausted all the time and constantly feel out of breath. So i got my holter monitor on Thursday and brought it back on Friday when I was getting my echo. There were two ladies in the room, one doing the echo and one reporting on other peoples echoes. Anyway the lady doing my echo spent ages on one part of my heart. Then she said to the other lady "" I think we should call the cardiologist down to do a bubble test"" the other one said is there contrast flow? And she said no but it's not small. They were being very can't when I asked them what's wrong and they were reluctant to say anything to me. Eventually they said that there seems to be a hole in my heart. The other lady reporting seemed reluctant to call the doctor down and said it would take ages to do a bubble test today and when I said I don't mind waiting she said no. We will have to report on this and get back to your doctors and they will decide what they want to do and someone will ring you if they want a bubble test done but everything was normal so don't worry. But there is a hole there? I asked . Yes but your doctor will ring you. She then gave me an incident monitor to use for a week and said a doctor will ring me that day if they felt they wanted to do something else. I have to say it was really weird and a scary experience as I don't know why they were being so cagey. If it is serious? Why they would let me go if it was serious? Why they said I have a hole in my heart and then said everything normal but still there is a hole? What the hell does that even mean? No doctor has rang me yet so I don't know what that means either. Maybe it means it's not serious. But surely a hole in your heat that's ""not small"" would be serious enough for further investigation at least? Any help with this would be fantastic or if anyone had a similar experience? Or if anyone could even tell me what I should be looking for on the Internet? What its most likely to be ? Thanks xxxx"
Heart Attack,weird symptoms,"Since February I have been having weird chest problems, sometimes my heart flutters, lots of palpitations, little skips and lots of aching between breasts and to the left. My chest always feels buzzy and I feel slightly dizzy. This lasts for a few days when goes, when it is at its worst I can feel my heart beating constantly no matter what I am doing, loud and strong in my ears.  I also get flutters which make me cough and sometimes it feels like my heart has stopped and then restarted.  Had lots of ECG's, an X Ray and blood test for heart attack, all negative apart from that I have the occasional extra heart beat which I am told is normal. I am seeing a cardiologist on 29th June to rule out anything sinister.  I am menopausal 56 and although overweight walk daily so try to keep my heart active.  I have GERD and have heard that both menopause and GERD can cause this, but not sure if I believe this just wanted to hear from anyone else with this as I am scared."
Heart Attack,HEADACHES AFTER AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT,"Has anyone suffered bad migrain type headaches, after this surgery. I never had them before. "
Heart Attack,Enlarged heart   -  operation to repair,"I have a relative who has been diagnosed with an enlarged heart.  My father died of an enlarged heart 25 years ago. so its in the family.I am an engineer so I can understand a simple explanation that if your heart gets bigger but the muscle doesn't get stronger then the pressure it can pump falls away and you have a problem of insufficient blood flow and low blood pressure.   Drugs that make the heart work harder are only going to wear the muscles out faster unless you can make them grow so they are again in the right proportion to the heart size.One drastic siolution I heard of is that instead of making the muscles grow or just work harder we make the pump back to its old efficiency.   Heart too Big?  Then just make it smaller.    The idea is that the surgeon just cuts a wedge out of the muscle and sews the remaining heart back together.   It all then heals and you have aas good as new,    I can't imagine what you do while it heals but I am only an engineer and I expect the heart experts to have such issues covered.   After all swapping a heart out is now routine.Can anyone tell me if they have heard of this operation and what they know about it?"
Heart Attack,Xray showed a Enlarged Heart,"Hello Everyone.I was told by my GP yesterday that I may have Heart Failure due to the results from my xray showing I have a enlarged heart.

But I am really annoyed has she had the results from the xray since the 1/4/15 and I only could find out on the 16/4/15..Has anybody found out this way before and what is the prognosis I get everyone is different.

Heart Attack,Felodipine,I hate this stuff I have  pains in my knees when I take it. Twice I have taken myself off it and each time the knee problems have gone away. I have decided to insist on being taken off it on my next visit to my GP.I had my concerns dismissed last time. After reading other posts here I won't let that happen again.
Heart Attack,My Partner wants to stop taking his drugs,"My partner was rushed to hospital after having chest pain for hours (he only woke me after 3 hours of severe pain)They found a blocked artery and did an angioplasty - putting in at least 2 stents into the Coronary artery.The blockage may have been an old blockage, the heart had been bypassing the problem until now - He's on Bisoprolol, Tricagrelor, Ramipril, Atorvastatin, Soluble Aspirin and Glyceril Trinitrate, All of which he wants to stop taking as he feels that he's breathless all the time and has other side effects. He's not the most patient person and has mild learning difficulty - I've told him that he will likely have another heart attack if he does stop them.Can anyone out there help me frighten him into being sensible about thisThanks"

Heart Attack,boyfriend has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with constant chest pain,"My boyfriend was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy at 15 and is now 19. He had a pacemaker and a defibrillator placed in his chest at 15 . He has chest pain almost constantly, especially after he eats, whether its steak dinner or a granola bar. He cant even sleep layin down, he has to sit up. He has seen multiple doctors including going to mayo clinic.  They continue to tell him its just acid reflux even though none of the medicines prescribed help. He says he can tell a major difference when he gets acid reflux as compared to his ""normal"" chest pain. I'm just trying to see if anybody would have any helpful ideas as to what he should do? I hate seeing him miserable all the time."
Heart Attack,Is my heart rate too high?,"I am 17 year old male.  I felt some mild back pain this morning behind my left shoulder blade (which has since subsided)  along with some discomfort in my left arm (sort of the feeling when you lay down funny on your arm).  I also get spotty mild chest pain near the left side of my sternum every now and then  I have been taking my heart rate a few times throughout the course of the day and it has resided around 100-104 BPM.  The healthy  resting BPM for an adult is between 60-100.  I am aware that what I took was not my resting heart rate, but I am still worried that it is high.  I drink a lot of water, but I don't exercise regularly.  I sit most of the day, but still walk around 3-5 km (2-3 miles) a day.  I usually worry about my health a lot even though I appear to be a relatively healthy person.  I am 6 feet 1 inches tall and weigh around 170 pounds.  I have played sports all my life but have recently  temporarily stopped due to my family moving.  I stress out a lot about school and my own health.  "

Heart Attack,do you have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy? if so i have info for you.,"This in reference to alchahol ablation my had it done for her cardiomyopathy..her heart thickness was a 3.75 in thickness normal is .90 to .99 she was diagnosed at sixteen caught from a murmer from a sports physical.I met my wife when she was eighteen weight was 180 at the time.she was 5,6""..she was diagnosed with a very aggressive from of "" HISS"" and put on Bette blockers which did help regulate her heart beat. There was times however her "" SYMPTEMS "" would occur.I would witness her heart beat so hard it would not only knock the breath out of her but you could physically see it beating raising the chest cavity each beat.she was warned no exercise or physically activity period.at nineteen she chose to start a family despite the risks.mind you her heart thickness was 2.80 at this time.our son was six months old when doctors decided she needed surgery.alcohol ablation or cum the muscle directly.this is a genetic disease that seems to show up only during and after puberty..her aunt has the same by 25 she chose to cut the muscle.she's had three surgeries to do do in last ten years so my wife decided the ablation.the surgery hurt her so bad from the forced heart attack she didn't want another surgery..the ablation went good. A success in text book terms. So she decided to have another child. Pregnancy went good birth was c section due  to doctors orders still no exercise. She now weighed       235 lbs.she chose not to have a difibulator put in.however her ""SYMPTOMS"" had not happened since the surgery and the last review before her death was an improvement 2.60 or was it? So in all sixteen found murmer,by eighteen heart thickness was twice normal thickness 2.80, twenty after first child heart was 3.0, twenty one had surgery alcohol ablation thickness 3.75,twenty two had second child.she was twenty four when she passed from this aggressive disease..autopsy showed a thickness of 2.5  so it did work. I asked mortician would a defibulator would of helped her from her heart attack and his answer was no. That he had never seen a heart so rock hard it was hard to cut into.he thinks from the initial ablation is why it was so hard lots of scar tissue showing age from damage.all in all I do still support the surgery, however I do suggest the difibulator also.my daughter is nine and we just found a murmer. This scares the hell out of me.keep on your weight I know its hard due to restrictions on exercise..if you havebeen diagnosed screen your kids it is genetic.let me repeat that it is genetic.whether its your kids or grandkids some one will get it..preeteen checks and late teen checks is my recommendation her aunt was diagnosed at twenty two my wife at sixteen now my daughter at nine.seems to be more aggressive as generations go on.thank you sincerely ritmar."
Heart Attack,"Since I was 9 (Now i'm 17) My legs hurt for no reason, sometimes it can turns blue.","Hello, Since I was a kid I went to many doctors, nobody could find out what is my problem.. I'm desperate. In the last 6 months it's also become to hurt my hands too, it just happened me twice but it's scarry since it does the same effect as my legs, it becomes blue (not always, sometimes it can be blue without pain but usually it has pain). When I say pain I mean that I feel my hand or my legs very heavy, it's a pain I can't suffer, i barely can put clothes on me, usually it takes 2 days until it past. I really have no more hopes and I wish somebody could figure out my problem..Thank you so much.By the way, I really have no clue where should this subject belong D: I have been told 3 days ago I should do heart tests after I have told this problem to a proffesional doctor, those tests I havent done yet, but I did do everything even MRI 2 times.Maybe my luck is here... <3>"

My consultant took me off the spironolactone but since then i have started to get a lot of pressure in my neck, head and fingers its a strange feeling but its only happened since coming off the spiro or it could be a coincidence im not sure, my sleep is non existent as the pressure is really bad when i lie down and sometimes even when i sit bolt up right, it has got to the point where i sleep down stairs now as i have a more comfy position on the settee, I have no other symptoms which amazed the hf clinic and now all this,i wanted to know  is it normal ?My consutant has booked a angiogram so waiting to see if i need bypass or stents."

Heart Attack,Heart dicease,i was told yesterday that I have serious heart dicease no chance of a bypass as 95% arteries furred up in to many places. Dr has said he will talk to two other surgeons to see if they will attempt it. Devastated I am only 68 don't know now what to do. My husband and family are really devastated . Where to go now
Heart Attack,Hypertrophic obstructive Cardiomyopathy ,Hello I am trying to work out what we should do next as we are gutted. My husband went into hospital on 3 jan as he had a re occurrance of his atrial fibrillation. On the letter we received yesterday it mentions that it was thought my hubby had the above in 2005 but no formal diagnosis was confirmed. He was referred for an atrial fibbrillation which worked for a few years.  My son died last year out of the blue playing football at the age of 29. From what we have read if my hubby had been diagnosed in 2005 my son would have been tested as routine. Is this right? Could we have saved him? So upset right now I can't think straight and my husband is devastated thinking he killed him. Thank you if you read this it probably does not make any sense.

Heart Attack,CT heart scan,"Just asked my cardio consultant if I can have one of the new CT scans that can show your heart and any artery blockages etc. which is a lot less invasive than another angiogram his answer was ""why do you want a CT scan, they can give you cancer"". !!!"
Heart Attack,Extra heartbeat,"Had virus early January with really bad chest pains went to A&E had 2 ECG's which were good, it then turned into chest infection and heart still  felt weird, had ECG at GP's who said it was a bit irregular but would be due to chest infection, as I could still feel it a couple of days later panicking went back and was given another one and told that I have the occasional extra heartbeat, but nothing to worry about, it did not show up in January when I went to A&E when these pains first started.  Any one else heard of this, I still have the occasional pain in my chest which moves from side to side, but have GERD so think this is what is causing it.  Just mistified about the extra heart beat thing."

Heart Attack,cardiovascular a possibility?,"I posted this in anciety disorder as well.6 months ago spontaneous first time asthma attack. Around that time I developped a tingle in lower leg and arm, which comes and goes. B12 was low, but got injections. The tingle has gotten worse lately and spread out more.Nearly two weeks ago I woke up because I had difficulty breathing. Since then I'm taking my asthma spray again. My lungs are clear and not restricted in size; it rather feels like there's not enough oxygen in the air. Thursday I developped a diffuse tingle on the tip of my tongle. Friday I saw red lines, which exactly fitted where the tingling is, thus it had become locally extremely restricted and was not diffuse anymore. When I worked out it suddenly mostly vanished, as did the red lines. That got me thinking:The tingling is worse when I'm extremely inactive: laying on the sofa surfing the net, or being extremely focussed on my work, basically forgetting everything around me or when I'm waking up in the morning or at night for a pee. It gets better when I'm active.I don't know where the lack of oxygen comes in, but the asthma spray speeds up my heartbeat a bit. After 30 minutes I can breathe again and the tingling is less (symbicort needs so long). Well... not over the last 2 days: I needed a double dose. I guess I'm getting used to the spray. Also without the spray, the tingle was always least when I was most active. Though after my swimming workouts my face, lower arms and legs feel like I've been hyperventilating. This vanishes again after half an hour. Doesn't happen with other sport (weight lifting, bodyweight exercises and big bag boxing without getting as out of breath as with swimming)My theory, apart from anciety which my doctor prefers: What if the tingling is caused by 'too tight' blood vessles, which get wider when being more active or something similar?I can't think of anything that I' afraid of. I had a few episodes of waking up in the middle of the night with a feeling that my heart beat had either slowed and weakened down substantially or stopped for a short moment. I can feel it coming back to life again. But I completely forget about it again. I'm a daydreamer type, with thoughts everywhere or hyperfocussing. My thoughts don't stay with any of this. I simply forget it. Though the first asthma attack was also preceeded by two nights of waking up with a 'lack of heart beat'. This btw repeats itself as soon as I fall asleep again. Wake up dizzily - think 'oh no, not again' - short attention span kicking in and falling asleep again - rinse and repeat 20 minutes later. Though to be honest: two nights ago was the second or third time only since the first asthma attack. I completely forgot about it, and I certainly don't think about it anymore in the morning. I also ocassionally have episodes of very irregular heart beat, but that doesn't scare me anymore either. It also usually happens at night and I wake up from it.The annoying bit with all this is: a 24h ECG might be in order, but I cannot get one the moment my heart is acting up, and if I go to the emergency room when it's happening everything is fine. As a child I always tried to break new diving records at the pool (free diving techniques). I learned to controll my heart beat. I can slow it down at will, and I can stop the irregularities by just listening to my heart. Having an ECG focusses my attention to my heart, and everything is fine. Thought at night, when I stop thinking about it (short attention span) it immediately beats irregularly again."
Heart Attack,heart attack symptoms for 2 weeks!,"Hi, I'm a young female thats been having heart attack symptoms for around 2 weeks. When I first went to the doctor he thought it was a pinched nerve and has sent me to a physio therapist. However after 6-7 treatments it's not getting better. I feel like I have a nut stuck in my sternum more or less constantly. Some time the area around the left side me chest feels very uncomfortable. Like a tight feeling. I have moments where I feel very sweaty. Just from Sitting. Yesterday I felt out of breath and lightheaded just from brushing my hair ( although my hair is super long and thick and pretty hard work). I have been suffering from back pain which I first assumed was from work.. but I have been of work for a few days and still Have pain. Two days ago I suffered my first ever panick attack.( although I can't really say I felt panicked). sometimes I feel tingling in my left shoulder, arm and fingers. Last night I felt sick to my stomach but didn't through up. I smoke alot for about 10 years and haven't really been involved in much physical activity for the past 6-7 months. My doctor    said my heart and blood pressure are normal. I'm due for a CT scan tomorrow. Do you think I should be worried? I just have a really bad feeling that something is not Right!! Any comments appreciated."
Heart Attack,Looking for some help ,10 year old boy has a rapid heart beat upon waking in the morning with dizziness that then leads to vomiting could this be a heart problem
Heart Attack,Still waiting for test results,My husband had neuclear medicine tests on his heart over 2 months ago and we have heard nothing yet.  I have left messages with the consultants secretary to no avail.  We are hoping that no news is good news however he is in a lot a pain and we just need to know what happens now.  Really getting worried now.  A family member had her results back in just over a month but everything was ok with her.  Help?
Heart Attack,Medication three years after heart attack ?,"Hi,  I was just wondering what kind of medication people are taking after heart attack and in my case two stents being fitted.  It is now three years since my last procedure and I am still taking 15 tablets a day, albeit some prescribed twice per day which bumps the figure up.  I am currently taking:ANGITIL SR. 90 capsules twice dailyASPRIN 75mg once per dayATORVASTATIN 40mg once per dayISOSORBIDE MONONITRATE 10mg tablets 2 tabs twice per dayLANZOPRAZOLE 30mg twice per dayNICORANDIL 10mg tablets twice per dayNICORANDIL 20mg tablets twice per dayOLMESARTAN MEDOXOMIL 20mg tablets once per day My sister is rather concerned about this as she knows people who have had open heart surgery by-passes etc. who aren't taking nearly as much medication as me.  Also, I am taking the statins which were prescribed following my procedures yet I have NEVER had high cholesterol.  My recent blood tests are showing raised blood sugar and I am wondering now if the statins could be the cause of this as the media are warning of a strong connection.  I would really appreciate your views on the amount of medication I am taking and also your views on statins.  Thank you for taking the time to read this."
Heart Attack,ECG was not quite right.,"Hi Anyone heard of this before, I have had a virus and non stop cold etc since early January starting with tonsilitis, now have lung infection. Had chest pain in left breast and underam which started with the tonsilitis went to A&E, this was a few weeks ago said all was ok had 2 ECG's  Yesterday went to gp with wheezy cough, hence the diagnosis of lung infection. still having sore underarm and chest pain not constant but on and off, did another ECG which showed up as being a bit odd, not sure what was meant by this as nurse spoke to GP, I did not get chance too, but GP said it was due to the lung infection, it should clear up after antibiotics and not to worry, but if still there in a week to go back.  Today it all feels much better am on really strong antibiotics, you take 1 for 3 days so after 2nd one the pain has definitely reduced.  Can virus/infection really do this to the heart of should I be asking for more tests."
Heart Attack,severe heart failure,"my husband 69 years old and .was admitted to hospital in nov 2014 with atrial fibrillatin and diognosed with heart failure.  When he was discharged he seemed tp improve on the regime of pills they gave him. His general well being started to deteriorate in mid Feb 2015 and was readmitted to hospital , after many scans, blood tests, ultrasounds etc, it was assessed that his heart ET was 25% in dec'14 and now 15% 27th feb'15My husbands short term memory is nil..  I went to collect him from hospital, and although I had understood from him that all the tests were fine.   before we left I said I really did want to speak to a doctor about his condition (I never seemed to be at the hospital at the right time, and nurses cannot tell me details over the phone!}  I was knocked sideways to be told there was nothing to be done for his  serious heart failure and palliative care was the way forward,, .To make matters worsethat there appeared to be a mass in his spleen which was probably the start up again of a previous ""non-hodgkins lymphatic cancer"" that  he had 6 years ago.I was in total shock, I still do not know what the prognosis will be, and what life expectancy I can hope for him.He sleeps most of the time, gets breathless at any exertion. and asks me about 4 times every day what is wrong with him.Is there anyone out there in a similir position or can give me any idea of what the future holds, and it what ways I can improve things for my husband.He has no appetite and no real interest in anything.  I feel we have been abandoned"

He's 54, quite fit, family history of heart disease.  Few days ago he had been feeling 'off' came home from work said he felt ill, then all symptoms of previous MI presented, only not as severe.  Ambulance arrived, ECG and cardiac enzyme test OK.  He was discharged but still does not feel right and we are very worried.  He is convinced it was another MI.  Could it be possible that another small MI occurred without showing in test?  Any help would be greatly received."
Heart Attack,After having a heart attack 3 months ago I still have my off days!,"After my heart attack, I had a stent fitted in my LAD.

However, some days I feel as if I am making progress, then I have days when I feel so tired and listless with no energy whatsoever. I also have moments of being a little 'breathy'. Is is this normal to have days like this? My consultant says I am making good progress, but I am becoming a little down as I have always led such a healthy lifestyle and with so much energy. I am 62 years old and I had no signs or symptoms of developing heart disease. "
Heart Attack,Felodipine and Amlodipine - definitely not for everyone,"Just sharing as this site helped reassure me when I felt horrendous with the side effects.  I take Losartan but, as it isn't sufficient to bring my blood pressure down to safe levels, the doctor tried me on Amlodipine in conjunction with the losartan, pretty quickly I developped pains down my legs and in my ankles and knees but especially in my shoulders where i lost range of movement, I felt sluggish and exhausted and as though I'd aged 10 years  in the space of a few weeks.  It did however normalise my blood pressure so after a month of trying it but hating it I asked the doctor to try a different variant of the same kind of medication just in case it was specifically the amlodipine so he switched me to Felodipine.The Felodipine was REALLY REALLY bad or maybe it was the accumulative effect of  continuing to take this kind of medication for 2 months.  I can't find the words to adequately describe how I felt - I had the worst brain fog imaginable, I had no energy and would sit at my desk at work almost in a drunken stupor waiting for the hours to pass so I could go home, I'd feel dizzy (I kept worrying that I would get run over as I could barely walk) and confused and would have several hours each day when I could barely frame a sentence or speak.  I felt cut off from everything happening around me.  It started becoming really frightening - just in the space of a month my ability to function dropped by about 90%.  In retrospect it sounds ridiculous that I wasn't sure it was the Felodipine but I started thinking something was seriously wrong with me and then I found this website.  I read a couple of peoples' experiences and realised I had exactly the same thing which gave me the courage to tell my doctor I couldn't continue with it.  I came off the Felodipine a week ago and have switched to a diuretic - the first few days off Felodipine I still had terrible bouts of dizziness and worried maybe it wasn't the drug but by day 4 my energy started to return and the bouts of confusion etc become fewer and shorter.  I'm now pretty much back to normal and do a full day's work, can talk to people again and do all those things which we take for granted.I read a posting on here where someone said that their workmates said ""welcome back"" to them when they came off the Felodipine and the same thing happened to me the other day with my deputy - she said whilst I was on it she hadn't felt like she was talking to the me she knew and she really noticed that I often couldn't complete a sentence - she now feels like the old me has come back. I'm not knocking the drug - it works well for a lot of people but if you are suffering then do try something else - I'd almost reached the stage of such apathy that I couldn't be bothered to do anything about it but I feel I've got my life back just by stopping taking one tiny tablet each day. "
Heart Attack,whooshing sensations in neck?1,"Hello i'm currently 17 years old and weigh around 10 stone,I currently have no bad medical history background, however I do suffer from anxiety, and am an extremely health anxious person, this has resulted me having a lot of panic attacks in the past, which used to make me think that I have a heart problem however a EKG done 6 months ago from when this was happening prooved nothing wrong and everything including bloodtests came back fine. However me being a very health anxious results in me being a constant pulse checker and over the course of 5 months, when regularly checking my pulse in my neck I have felt whooshing sensations, however these only last for 5-10 seconds, then my pulse will go back to its regular sounding ""thump-thump"" beat, however these only happen occasionally, but they scare me soo much, as I think it might indicate something wrong with my heart, as I have researched this and apparently these whooshing sensations could indicaate some sort of bloodclot, But I have no other symptoms when this weird pulse sensation happens in my neck I just need some answers as to what this might be?"
Heart Attack,"Low heart rate, is it normal?","Hi, I have recently joined a gym and realised, compared to my incredibly fit friend, my heart rate is very low. I have bought a heart rate monitor (one of the little watches) and found my resting heart rate is usually between 50-65. I should point out I am not at all fit haha, I am a 20 year old, 5'2 female, weighing 125lb and struggle ding any kind of exercise for more than a couple of minutes. I have seen online that there is a condition called bradycardia which is associated with hypothyroidism which runs very strongly in my family, and my mother believes me to have, though have never been officially prescribed with.I have had my blood pressure etc checked at the doctor's before, however I struggle quite badly with social anxiety so I find everytime it has been officially checked my heart has been racing and doctor's have still commented that it was quite low.I lso tend to black out quite often, particularrly when getting out of bed, chairs and the bath/shower, and I get weird fluttery heart beats occasionally as well which aren't the nicest.Obviously I am nervous about going to a doctor so thought I would ask online first about whether my heart rate is alright, or if I should maybe venture out to my local GP and get checked.Any help would be appreciated!"

Heart Attack,heart failure - watch for early signs,"I am not the patient with heart failure. The person with heart failure was well nine months ago and is about ninety years of age now. He has high blood pressure for which he is on amlodipine. I noticed he was getting slighty short of breath on walking at least five months ago. He does pranayama and sometimes yoga. Now he has developed leg swelling and there are crepitations in his lungs. I noticed that his pulse was 104 per minute and his blood pressure 160/ 80. He says his blood pressure is usually 140/ 80 mm Hg. I am pretty certain he has developed heart failure but we have to wait for a few days before he can be taken to the doctor. My mother also developed heart failure because of high blood pressure. I think people with high blood pressure should go to the doctor as soon as they see signs of breathlessness or swelling of the legs. A rise in pulse rate is also to be taken seriously unless it can be explained by fever or exercise or other reasons, especially in older people. Take your illness seriously and see the doctor."

Heart Attack,"Racing heart, head pressure, sound distorting...","Brief medical history (thought this may help rule things out): chronic fatigue, anemia, major depression, GAD. Bad neck.Recent symptoms/story: For a while now my heart rate has been quite elevated, even on resting. It is rarely under 100 bpm, tonight it is sitting at 115 beats/minute. Whenever I stand up, my heart starts to really thump and pound to the point it's uncomfortable. It sometimes skips as well. My blood pressure has always stayed the textbook 120/80, so until now I haven't been too concerned.The past week I have spent a bit of time on the computer, which I think may be half the problem, yet I have only rarely experienced this in the past but now it has been a constant thing for the past week or so. When I stand up, there is a huge pressure in the back of the head. My heart begins thumping really fast and hard, and my hearing is distorted, which is quite frightening. It's like a pulsating whooshing in my ears.Tonight I took my BP, which is usually perfect, but it was sitting at 100/60. This happened approx. 5 minutes after standing and is a very low reading for me.I admit I do not exercise nearly enough as I should. However I find exercise extremely painful, my heart gets so fast and thumping and I get faint so it kind of scares me to exercise. Now I'm getting way too unfit and this can only contribute to the problem Could the elevated heart rate and low blood pressure be related? Anyone experienced these symptoms? "

Heart Attack,Really worried about my heart - 14 yo male ,"A few days ago I noticed that I have a strange feeling near my heart : it feels like butterflies, something like muscle fasciculations, just right at my heart. It passed away on its own, at least that's what I thought. But yesterday I noticed it again, and I became concerned. Then I found out (Internet)  that this exactly describes atrial fibrillation. I'm really worried since then. It just comes and goes. It lasts a few minutes at most. I have no other symptoms.I read that afib is very rare in my age, but it looks exactly like that to me.. Is this surely afib or can it be something else? "

Heart Attack,so scared (etopic beats),"Hello, for the past 3 years i have suffered from etopic beats that scare me so much.I have been diognosed from SVT which i have had since childhood but this was alwsays infrequent, like id have an attack every 8 monthes and so on but since ive had these etopic beats it induces SVT attacks now several times every week. There is something wrong in my body causing these etopic beats as i have never had them before like this (only during an SVT attack) but all my blood tests and heart scan is normal. I have also been told i have Bradycardia which is a very recent thing too as my heart rate used to be 60 BPM in the past (yes im a freak who regularly counted pulse) and in recent trsts it was always 60 BPM. Now its decresed to 44BPM in the past 3 years. I have other symptoms as well but i am told there is nothing wrong with me.Today i went shopping with my toddler and my heart skipped a beat (trying to go into an SVT) and i went all faint and felt a heavy head until then it started up again but went into SVT mode then back to normal rhythm mode. Did my heart stop? can etopic beats/SVT cause your heart to stop working? I feel guilty because what if i collapsed and my daughter was alone on her own and someone snatched her, im panicking at what could have been.Can your heart just stop and send you to collapse?What could be making my symptoms worse?"
Heart Attack,ECG,Hello . I'm a 19 year old female having my first ECG done tomorrow. What should I expect? Will I have to remove my top and bra? If they don't find anything should I say that I get about 8 continuous not normal beats that usually occur in the evening? 
Heart Attack,Trying to figure out this heart 'issue',"Hey everyone. So this is all very long but i''ll try to sum it up as quick as I can. I'm a 30 year old female, slightly overweight but mostly healthy (as far as I know) The last 6 years or so I started with this heart 'issue'. It started as an uncomfortable pounding with some exertion. Heat would bring on a pounding feeling, as would a heavy meal. The only thing that seemed to help was if I drank alcohol, or fell asleep and i'd usually wake up feeling better. So 9 months ago I had a baby and ever since i'm having more issues and more often. After I had my daughter I was getting a lot of chest pains. Well I have been to the ER probably 12 times in the last 5 months for heart issues and they find nothing. I've had countless EKG's, bloodwork checking my cholesterol/lipid levels-all the work-up/stress test, MRI, x-rays..and this week i'm getting a halter monitor to wear. Well i'm no longer really getting the chest pains but i'm getting the pounding feeling a lot more..when I have this feeling sometimes my heart isn't really even pounding..I feel my pulse and it feels pretty normal and steady but it feels uncomfortable. It makes me not want to do any kind of exertion at all and if I do it starts to pound like crazy until I sit back down. Also i've been getting quite a bit of skipped beats..just went to the ER and they caught them on EKG as well as on the heart monitor but said my heart was in a normal rhythm & they were basically benign. I went out last night for a friends birthday and tried having a few beers..at first I was getting the pounding feeling so I was drinking water with my beer...after a while that subsided. Then I started getting the uncomfortable/skipped beats feeling. Alcohol use to 'help' it, but now it seems to make it worse. I just can't understand how I have all of these issues yet they find nothing wrong? Heat seems to make my heart pound uncomfortably, as well after eating sometimes, and chocolate. I no longer drink any caffeine. I do have anxiety but I just feel like this is more than anxiety. Does anyone have any thoughts on this?"
Heart Attack,27 & high heart rate. Concerned.,"Hello!I do not exercise on a regular basis but I do stay active. Walking, hiking, swimming, bike riding etc. Lately staying active has been getting hard for me. I'm also getting married in the spring so I have been hitting up the gym. My heart rate will hit 160 in less then one minute just power walking. Another time I was hiking for only a few minutes and I started to become dizzy and my heart rate was 190. I get winded so easily. Along with this I start yawning constantly & my ears feel like someone is sticking a knife in them. WEIRD right?!? Connected?? No clue! I've worn a holtor monitor and the Dr. said it came back fine. So does this mean I'm THAT out of shape or do I need more tests?!I'm female. Age 27. 180 lbs, 5'7 "
Heart Attack,Stent placed after angiogram showed 50% block in LAD,"I recently did an angiogram and it was found that the blockage was 50%. The doctor then went a step ahead and did an ultrasound and based on what he saw, he decided that the blockage was 80% and placed a sten in my LAD. Was he right in doing that even though the angiogram showed only 50% block ?. I have the angiogram disk, but do not have any evidence of the ultrasound to confirm that the block was indeed 80%. Are the ultrasound pictures stored somewhere and how do I get those pictures. "
Heart Attack,"Labelled, categorized, and discriminated against as suffering with health anxiety?","Sound familiar?I've had concerns regarding my vascular & circulatory health since the start of 2014, and found after a brief 10 minute scheduled consultation which typically beyond the initial reasons for my visit they fail to further engage & discuss failing to demonstrate any level of medical knowledge to support their unsupported medical opinions, consultations have merely consisted of clinical observation and physical examinations which they arrogantly dismiss my health concerns trivalizing my symptoms often attributing them to psychological causes such as anxiety or musculoskeletal chest wall pain ensuing a cycle of waitful watching, verbal reassurance, and prescriptions which I'm coming to learn as no further action, false assurances, and symptom suppresants leaving me to believe what they're unable to afford to assess and treat medically, they dismiss & supress clinically?I feel I've not been irrational as I've continually presented very broad health concerns regarding my ""vascular & circulatory health"" which a multidude of medical conditions could be responsible for in which the complex nature of symptoms behind many widely misunderstood medical conditions are often subtle, vague, broad, overlapping, and indistinguishable making it challenging to diagnose solely relying on clinical observation and physical examination I've had ECGs but they're not definitive, comprehensive, or conclusive piece of diangostic equipment and are simple/basic/affordable test providing limited insight into patient's health yet feel they've used a normal reading to provide false assurances of my vascular & circulatory health mainpulating patient into accepting health anxiety and thus ceasing to investigate my symptoms concluding causality is anxiety.. I've had A&E visit (out of GP hours 111 referral) and most recently a consultation with NHS cardiologist whom treated me with the same contempt as my GPs declining my request for echocardiogram & doppler ultrasound concluding the consultation arrogantly suggesting I forget my health concerns and move on with my lifeView my response posts to the orignal poster in the thread below for a full history of symptoms and medical assessments only provided due to my continued persistency.. I tacked onto his thread as I was disatisfied from a consultation with the intention of signing up to patient forums to post a similiar type thread but feel how am I able to trust NHS GPs when NHS GPs have little control or discreation over the quality & standard of care it delivers to it's patients constrained by protocol, resource & finance limitations plus a large number of NHS GP pratices are explicity involved in incentivized referral reduction schemes on top of there implicit rationing and cost saving agendas.. I feel they're largely gambling with patient's health saving the NHS untolds amounts of wealth yet is largely contributing to the misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis which ultimately leads to patient suffering and patient fatalities which could have been prevented if their health concerns were sufficiently investigated. I was going to post this in the anxiety disorder group but didn't want to alarm them https://patient.info/forums/discuss/i-am-30-this-year-can-i-have-a-heart-attack--216293?page=0#440631GPs have continually opted for low cost options and have extracted hundreds of pounds out of me to supress my symptoms earning GPs a prescribing fee, pharmacies a dispensing fee, and the remaining amount is contributed back into the NHS, I feel they're very reluctant to refer patients for medical assessment as the pratice surgery would be financially responsible to finance secondary care out of their alloted budget and the waiting times to see specilists & recieve secondary care is ridiculous. I have a lot more I wish to say but find it diffucult to articulate and condense down and there's no edit option so this will do and thanks for anyone who cares to listen"

Heart Attack,"Work this one out, because the Dr's cant","I am 36 ex smoker not overweight,  normal cholesterol,  not diabetic.  2 weeks ago I was admitted to hospital with atypical heart attack symptoms. Aching jaw and ear, mild chest ache, back pain and left arm pain along with vomiting. My tropinin levels were raised at 12 and then 12 hours later at 20000 which although high not massive. My ecg, ekg, and x ray were all normal. I then had an angiogram expecting as well as the Dr's that there would be a blockage.  Low and behold they say my heart is pristine. After 5 days in ccu I was discharged but was put on statins, nitrates, aspirin and diltiazem. They think it may have been a spasm but they want to investigate further. This is causing me massive anxiety issues, they wonder if maybe a small clot has slipped through the net or it may be something else. I am having an MRI soon.My panic attacks are through the roof with the not knowing and I got readmitted last night but strangely my tropinin levels are back to normal which shocked my cardiologist. I am now on diazapam and temazapan. Anybody help with this at all. What else would have caused all them symptoms and the raised troponin? "
Heart Attack,Chest pain only when laying down,I am male 32 years old. I have had the pain for some months now and wondering if anyone has had anything the same.

When i get the pain i can basicly stop it by sitting up or going for a walk around the house.

I've had severe chest pain 2 months ago (with shoulder pain, difficulty breathing and rapid heart beat), went to the doc and made a heart CT scan.

Heart Attack,Idk if I'm really ill or is it anxiety?,Hi I'm 23 and I've always been a healthy girl. However last year I felt like I was getting a heart attack so my family took me to the ER. Where they did a ekg and results came back normal. But it's been a year now and I still don't feel myself. I akways get weird symptoms and always have heart palpitations that come and go. They scare me so much that sometimes I just want to be stuck in my room and cry. I also get discomfort when I take a deep breath in my back. No doctor takes me that serious they always say I'm too young to have heart trouble and that I seem fine that is probably just stress and anxiety. Any advice thank you.. Ps sometimes my left arm and leg feel weird too.

Heart Attack,What is the risk attached to stopping taking bisoprolol,"Hi. I am a very fit 68, I have aeschaemic heart disease and have had a stent inserted. I get angina occasionally but only when I exercise vigorously. I have not had a heart attack. I am on simvastatin, aspirin and bisoprolol (2.5mg). My problem is that I get ridiculously cold feet, even in warm weather and I gather that this is a side effect of the bisoproplol. My question is, what is the risk attached to stopping taking bisoprolol? My doctor just says that it's the standard treatment for my condition and I ought to keep taking it. Does anyone know of any research that gives hard statistics on people who have NOT had a heart attack, but have aeschaemic heart disease? Do the statistics show that I am more likely to have a heart attack if I stop the bisoprolol? If so, what is the risk? Is it 5%, 10%, 50% or what?I have only found one relevant article on the internet (https://www.bhf.org.uk/media/news-from-the-bhf/beta-blocker-study.aspx). The headline is ""A new observational study has shown beta-blockers are not associated with a lower risk of heart attacks or stroke in certain groups of heart patients.""But this is only one study. Are there others?Thanks. Peter206"

Heart Attack,Heart Palpitations,"I have been having heart palpitations since Monday - 5 days now. I've been to the docs who was not that helpful but sent me for an ECG which said my heart was beating slowly. He was very vague about whether this was bad or not! I do do a lot of exercise so he said people who do generally do have a slow heart but researching it myself, coupled with the palpitations, it could be something more serious but he said it's all fine and no abnormal heart beats during the ECG (but in the 15 second test, i didn't have a palpitation!). My blood pressure is fine too. He has referred me to a cadiologost to get a 24 hour heart monitor done but thinks it's all fine and just 'ectopic beats'. Seems to be going on for too long though and i am worrying to wait for the next appointment. Has anyone else had anything like this - how long might it go on for etc? "

Heart Attack,Surgery worries for RVOT-VT ,"Hi there I have recently (2 days ago) been diagnoised with Right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia. I am 22 and so my doctor has advised that an ablation procedure would be best suited instead of mediacion for life. He has refered me to a Cardiologist to discuss the operaition however going over the procedure quickly with me.I have avoided researching the surgery online as I know it will only scare me, however my doctor explained that I will be awake and under a local anesthetic whilst they give me instuctions during the procedure.This is kinda scaring me a little as I have never had an operation before and the thought of being conscious through it is a little daunting.Has anyone had this op before and can reasure me a little of it's success and their experience during the op? Thank you!Rachel x"
Heart Attack,CT scan vs Stress test,So my dad had a stress test due to chest pain a couple months ago that was clear. Recently had CT chest that showed extensive coronary arthrosclerosis. Seems hard to believe that would have deveolped in 2 months. Would you trust a stress test over a CT?

Heart Attack,Last night I had pain in the centre of my chest,"It was whilst I was lay down either on my back or side. The pain would last about 15-20 seconds...quite intense, then go away but come back after a few minutes. Gradually the frequency got longer. I took some Rennes, milk and eventually some paracetamol. What should I do. I can't get to see my G.P. Till Thursday."

Heart Attack,Angina worse after stents,"We're trying to get to the bottom of a mystery!My dad has a history of heart trouble, with heart attack & quadruple bypass about 25 years ago.  After major lifestyle change, he's lived pretty well but with some angina in past few years.He's had swollen feet for a long time so recently had ultrasound on his heart which came back fine, no problems other than very minor valve leak which the Dr said didn't need attention.  My dad then got a little too pleased with his results and went and pushed himself very hard on a treadmill (yes, we shouted at him later!) and the same day had a minor heart attack!   Was admitted, had CT scan which showed his major artery was clear and then an angiogram at which they put one stent and balloon in place.All other tests appear fine, no significant signs of heart failure, or anything else, and yet since the stent, his angina is worse.  He had it yesterday at rest (it was always on exertion before the stent) and it wasn't relieved with GTN, so they admitted him again.  Tests are clear this morning, he's not had another heart attack but remains a mystery why, 4 weeks later, he's getting worse pain than before.   Could it be artery stretch? Or something else? "
Heart Attack,Thoracic aortic aneurysm and faulty heart valve,"I have recently been diagnosed with an thoracic aortic aneurysm and a badly damaged left ventricular valve.  The aneurysm is 5.9cm and on the arch at the top of my heart.  It was found by accident when I had a ct scan for difficulty swallowing then further tests followed which found that the 'murmur' I was diagnosed with 7 years ago had deteriorated so badly the left ventricular valve would have to be replaced with a mechanical one.  At the moment I am waiting for a final visit with the surgeon before being given a date for the op.  The thing is I feel perfectly fine, I have no pain, no shortness of breath, have as much energy as always and in fact feel fit as a fiddle.  I am 58 and have kept as upbeat as possible about all this, but my family are distraught with worry about the 10 - 15% chance that I won't make it through the surgery (national statistics) and the possibilty of stroke or paraylsis.  My dad had an aortic aneurysm (unknown to him) and it ruptured, he survived the surgery but died 3 months later having never left the hospital.  This was only 4 years ago and my mum is now sick with worry, literally, about me.  I am  worried that I will never get back to how I am now, that I will become reliant on family and friends.  Its usually me who helps the family with the children and my mum.  I live alone but have family close by and my ex husband (who is my best friend) has been a great support.  My family, bless them, are fussing around and not letting me do anything and I know I would be the same if I were in their shoes but I feel like an invalid although I should be grateful for their concern.  I am feeling so confused, I refuse to cry about this and I am holding myself so tightly together but seeing my families tears is breaking me up.  I am putting my 'healthy self' up for a life threatening, painful operation.  Has anyone else been in a similar position and could give a few words of encouragement?Many thanks"
Heart Attack,Ectopic Heartbeat?,"Hi allCompletely new to this forum.  I have had a bit of a whirwind of a few months and just wanted some advice/information if anyone could help.  I am currently waiting on a diagnosis of what doctor's think is Crohn's disease.  Had awful acid reflux and chest pains as well as a host of other symptoms, although this has all dies down now still not back to normal.  I am also now very happily 16 weeks pregnant with my second child   I am 28.  So because of all the chest pains I have been having and palpitation type feelings I had an ECG and 5 day monitor.  ECG was completely fine, monitor was fine apart from 1 'extra' beat as my doctor put it.  Heart rate was between 70 and 100 throughout.  Just wondered a couple fo things...first is that heart rate quite normal for my age?  And also, more so, what is an 'extra' beat?  My doctor didn't seem concerned but as I am the one with the chest pain/palpitations obviously I am more concerned...is this normal?  Any help would be really appreciated.  Thanks so much"
Heart Attack,I don't know what's wrong with me,"Hello All, I'm sorry to put this post here because I don't know actually in which category it belongs. I've been having health problem 12 years from now, my symptoms started after having a case similar to hypothermia. First, I noticed stiffness in my neck, shoulder muscles and a mild imbalance that is felt only when I turn from side to side. After a year, I got sick for a couple of days in the summer and after I recovered, weakness in my eye muscles appeared and sensitivity to light also developed which was identified later by an ophthalmologist. So far, these symptoms were part of my daily life and didn't resolve. In the next couple of years, I also developed mild peripheral neuropathy which was identified by EMG test, the doctor couldn't know the cause of it. After this period, I stared noticing that I have a decline in my cognitive skills, to put it in other words I felt my mind is getting slower, it was not sudden just slowly progressing over the years.Five years from now, I developed problems in my heart which was tricky, for three months I couldn't tolerate even mild efforts like climbing stairs or lifting moderately heavy stuff and even standing still for more than 10 minutes would trigger light headiness and my heart start racing, and the worst part was at night when I lie down, my heart used to feel like it's doing a big effort to keep everything's going. ECG and stress test didn't reveal anything back then which made me ask myself, what the hell is going on here. By the way, I used to be a very active guy when it comes to sports, I used to play basketball and hike all the time.After a year of having this weak heart, my heart symptoms resolved partially, I could do walks but still, standing for long times and lifting heaving stuff will directly trigger light headiness and feeling of tiredness. Fast forward till now, I guess I had a relapse again which started after I was hiking near my house, the next day I felt numbness in my jaw which went and came during the day, also my old symptoms of heart re-appeared but this time it was even worse. After this last relapse, I did a complete blood test including ANA, the results showed vitamin B 12 deficiency so my doctor put me on monthly injections. I also did a brain MRI, came out normal and ECG and stress test again which came out normal.I'm puzzled and right now, I feel I'm helpless regarding my health. If possible, I would be grateful if anyone could shed some light on some areas or give me pointers, or maybe share an experience similar in parts to mine and what did he/she do to resolve it. I appreciate in advance your help and input. "

Heart Attack,angina ,I have 60% heartfailure how to go about it 
Heart Attack,Heart failure and olive oil,"Olive oil could help reverse a patient’s heart failure ""immediately"", scientists have claimed. Oleate - the fat found in the golden liquid - could help a diseased heart pump blood more effectively and use body fat as fuel, researchers at the University of Illinois have found. The most common reason a person may suffer from heart failure is when the muscle becomes damaged, including after a heart attack, through drug or alcohol abuse, and high blood pressure. Shortness of breath, both during activity or rest; swelling of the feet, ankles, stomach and lower back; and fatigue are all symptoms of heart failure. Currently, there is no way to reverse heart disease, and a combination of medication and lifestyle changes help patients manage their symptoms and keep their condition stable.Scientists made their findings based on previous studies which show that a healthy heart absorbs fat to keep pumping, but if damaged the muscle can no longer process or store far – starving it of energy.This means the heart is unable to work hard enough, and toxic fat deposits are left to clog up arteries.Scientists believe that oleate helps the body produce enzymes which break down fat so the heart is once again able to absorb it""These genes are often suppressed in failing hearts,"" Douglas Lewandowski of the University of Illinois in Chicago told the Telegraph. ""So the fact that we can restore beneficial gene expression, as well as more balanced fat metabolism, plus reduce toxic fat, just by supplying hearts with oleate is a very exciting finding. ""This gives more proof to the idea that consuming healthy fats can have a significantly positive effect on cardiac health."" To make their findings published in the journal ‘Circulation’, researchers analysed how rats hearts responded to oleate or aplmitate, the fat found in animal fats and dairy products. When oleate was pumped through a failing heart, scientists saw an “immediate” improvement in how the heart contracted and pumped blood, Dr Lewandowski explained. But, when animal fats were pumped through the heart, the heart disease worsened and more toxic fat was produced. The study is backed by previous research which shows a diet high in olive oil can have the same affect as statins in reducing the risk of a heart attack."
Heart Attack,Heart muscle function improving but symptoms still the same,"Hi. Has anyone else experienced this please? Diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy & heart failure in March. Cardiologist suggested a CRT-D but wanted to wait for drugs to work fully first. Latest scan shows improved heart muscle function, which is great, but symptoms are still exactly same, especially breathlessness & tiredness. Can anyone help me understand this please ? It doesn't seem to make sense + CRT-D which he said should improve symptoms now seems unlikely. Thanks for any help. Val"

Heart Attack,Life long headaches stopped after heart attack,"Twelve years ago  I had a heart attack since then I've hardly had a headache. Before I used to get regular headaches, quite severe.

Heart Attack,Newly diagnosed and feeling very alone,"I am a 31 yr old wife and mother of three amazing children and recently I was told I have heart failure and was diagnosed with postpartum/dilated cardiomyopathy!! I gave birth to my beautiful baby girl in may 2013, it was a very tough pregnancy with many health issues that I believed would end after I have birth but they didn't. I have a weak spine due to fracturing a verterbrae in 2011, the same verterbra fractured again during my pregnancy and again during labour so when I wasn't feeling great after giving birth it was put down to having just had a baby and also my back.It made sense as my symptoms were tiredness (show me a mother to a newborn who isn't tired) I retained a lot of fluid which I was told was fluid dispersing around my body from the pregnancy, I was in a lot of pain every where which was put down to my back, I was continually fainting which was put down to low iron due to the fact I had to have surgery after giving birth and lost a lot of blood. These things went on for months but then seemed to get better except for the fluid but by then I believed it was fat and as I was getting married I tried everything to lose the weight but I just kept getting bigger and became very depressed. Almost exactly a year after giving birth I started to become breathless, I was exhausted all of the time  and I put that down to the fact that I had gained so much weight but even though I had list my appetite and hardly ate anything I couldn't lose the weight, I would take pregnancy tests over and over because my symptoms seemed like pregnancy.Then one day the breathlessness got worse and I couldn't lay down as I couldn't breathe and my chest was hurting, it felt like I was being stabbed with every breath I took!So I called my doctors and was told to call an ambulance, the paramedics said my oxygen was at 93 and my blood pressure was through the roof so they took me into hospital.At the hospital I was admitted and had a cat scan which the doctors believed showed I had Septic Emboli in my lungs blocking my arteries but they were unaware where the infection was they were coming from so I was prescribed a number of IV antibiotics, pain killers and fluids plus having numerous tests done including MRI's and an echo.On the day of my echo my breathing had got worse and I couldn't be in any position but upright and as the day went on even being upright was getting harder to breathe.Unfortunately I was on a surgical ward instead of a medical ward and the nurses were to trained in what was wrong with me and were also not very compassionate or sympathetic and treated me like I was making the whole thing up so when I would ask for a doctor I was told I didn't need one and to just ""lay down and get some sleep"" nobody would listen to me, they would turn my oxygen up but I had a mask that would only allow a certain amount through so it made no difference, I was constantly needing the toilet but was attached to the bed with the oxygen and couldn't take the mask of for more than a few seconds but I had to go to the toilet as I had been waiting for 45 minutes for a nurse to answer my buzzer, while in the toilet I must have collapsed as I woke up on the bathroom floor struggling to breathe, I managed to get myself to bed at which point a nurse turned up and told me to ""shut up and get some sleep you are keeping everybody awake"" Finally at 4am (13 hours since I first asked for a doctor) a nurse called a doctor!! The doctor arrived and instantly took blood from my arteries then called for a senior consultant, when the senior consultant arrived he told me my blood test showed my oxygen levels were at 81 and he was shocked that I hadn't crashed!! He calked for a portable x ray and took the nurses aside for a ""quiet word"" about how disgusted he was that they left me like that. The x ray showed my lungs were drowning in fluid and I was instantly given a Fuorisimide drip and within minutes I was weeing non stop and my breathing got so much better. I thought that was it and everything would go back to normal but then another doctor came to see me and told me I was going to the Intensive Care Unit at which point I became very scared as I knew they don't take people who are easy to make better over there and something serious was going on.Within around 40 minutes of being on ICU a cardiologist came to see me and in those few moments he was talking to me he changed my entire life only I didn't realise it at the time, I heard ""you have heart failure, the right side of your heart is severely damaged and isn't pulling blood into the heart fast enough causing the left side to only be able to pump it out at 30% and also causing fluid to build up around the heart and lungs"" I didn't cry, I didn't ask questions, I didn't do anything but listen as they told me about the medication they were putting me onto and what they were going to do with me. I was scared but I hadn't truly understood what was going on and in my mind I believed they were going to fix me and send me home when I was better so I stayed in my bed and gradually was able to have the oxygen removed as the diuretics infusion was clearing away the fluid. I had a line put into my arteries so they could monitor my oxygen levels, I had lines put into my veins to administer drugs and I had a catheter fitted to remove all of the fluid.On top of all of this I was struggling with a coil is had fitted three months before as I had been bleeding the whole time so I had become anaemic, the coil was removed and I had to have a blood transfusion as I'd lost too much blood but that made me feel better and I was confident I was going to go home soon all better and back to myself. Then after a few days on the ICU (I'd been in hospital 10 days by now) I had a visit from the heart nurse and while talking to her I soon realised how wrong I had been and what I had was actually going to be with me for the rest of my life and my entire life had to change from that moment on!!My mum came in the room after the nurse left and I burst into tears and said ""I thought it would go away"" my mum replied ""I know you did baby but I had to let you realise it yourself"" that day I saw my children as the nurses believed it would be good for me but telling my children what was wrong with me was the hardest thing I've ever had to do, their little faces looked devastated and there was nothing I could do, I couldn't even hug them properly because of all the wires. Since then things haven't been great, I'm constantly exhausted, don't ever want to eat, never have any energy for anything and when I do have the energy I be one breathless within minutes. My home life is terrible, I'm constantly arguing with my husband because he has no idea how hard this is to live with. I have very little real support from anyone and I feel so alone. Not only have I had to come to terms with having heart failure I also have to deal with the fact I'm not allowed anymore children and that is just as tough but everybody around me is bored of hearing about it and nobody understands that I need to talk about it. Nobody is helping keep my stress levels down so I'm constantly in pain in my chest even my husband will do hardly anything to make this easier. I'm extremely depressed and because I feel I can't talk about my condition there is still so much about heart failure that I don't know about.So I decided to go online and find people in the same situation that can relate and understand what I'm going through and hopefully I can do the same for them.I am sorry for the ridiculously long introduction but it's the first time I've been able to talk about the whole experience at once and when I started typing I couldn't seem to stop. I hope there is someone out there who reads this and thinks ""I know exactly how she feels"" or just simply someone who can see I just need to chat and stop feeling alone.Thank you for taking the time to read this and apologies again for the length of it and also for any grammatical errors.Thank youTerri "

Heart Attack,Arrhythmia: there was a supreme cure for me,"From my 15th until my 40th I have been suffering from severe arrhythmia. Went to doctors several times, they suggested I should just go on with life. It dramatically impaired my life and my possibilities. Sometimes my heart would skip 20 times in a row and I thought I was going to die. Have been looking for a cure for decades. All to no avail until a woman suggested me hawthorn. I went out to buy some hawthorn and made a tincture. While I was sceptical at first, the results have been magnificent. I have completely taken back my life. For the first time in decades I have no arrhythmia at all. I can even drink coffee. Thank God for this marvelous medicine and the woman who hinted me in the right direction. Now if you suffer from arrhythmia, of course there is no guarantee this will work for you but I just wanted to share my experience with you."

Heart Attack,Unable to obtain prolonged release Verapamil,My consultant cardiologist put me on prolonged release Verapamil 3 years ago when I had acute AF. Following a successful cardioversion I was told that I would have to take Verapamil for life. The product that I take is 180mg prolonged release from Univers. This was deemed the best medication for me as I have asthma. I felt rough when I took it initially but now my body accepts it apart from awful constipation. My GP said that in order to change the medication I would have to be closely monitored in hospital which did happen 3 years ago. The problem that I now have is that I am unable to find prolonged release Verapamil anywhere. This has been referred back to my doctor who is due back from holiday on Monday. I run out of my medication Friday next week and go to Namibia for 3 weeks a week later. I am really worried about this and hope that somebody with the same experience can help.
Heart Attack,Any ideas? ,"Hi, I have been passed on and passed on by so many DR. I am a 26 year old Male 5ft 10, and just under 11st. I smoke around 15 a day and drink one day a week only 4 beers on average. I am experiencing stabbing/cramping pains to the chest and pain in left hand shoulder and tingling in my left hand fingers. Pain gets worse if I breath in and can last for anything between 1min to 30mins. Been having attacks for the last 6 years had a really bad one a few weeks ago that almost made me pass out. I sweat ALOT hand and feet are the worst. Some times after attack it feels like I have been sucking a bag of penny's. There is no telling when or where it will happen 80% of time it's when I'm at rest. My ECG, bloods, and chest X-rays are all normal. My heart rate while resting is 85 and when at work it's around 120bpm. Was told for years it was panic attacks but I know this is not the case as I'm not worried or a nervous person. I have just only yesterday been passed onto a new GP not seeing him for two weeks tho. Any Advice is good advice. Many thanks Simon "
Heart Attack,Exercise and Heart Rate,"Could someone please advise me on a heart rate issue during and after exercise?My normal resting HR is around 76. Today I walked at a leisurely pace for 40 mins, sat for 20 mins, walked for 30 mins, sat for 20 mins, walked for 20 mins, then sat in the car on the way home for 20 mins.When I got home I was absolutely tired and shattered. My HR was then was 99, which is reasonable for me after exercise, but was still at 96 after sitting for half an hour. So I went to bed for an hour and then 3 hours after getting home my HR is still 93.Should it take so long for my HR to drop?P.S. I am 54, have 2 heart stents and I am just taking aspirin. "
Heart Attack,Bradycardia - how do I deal with it until a decision is made on how to fix it?,"I am 26 yrs old, have always been sporty, and a few months ago I woke in the night and ended up blacking out. I went to A&E and it appeared that my heart was bradycardic with a resting heart rate of between 40 and 45 BPM (about 10 beats lower than my normal resting heart rate). To cut a long story short, I have had all the tests and monitors under the sun and nothing seems to be wrong other than the fact that my heart rate is lower than usual. My bad episodes seem to happen at night when my heart rate is dropping too low when sleeping and therefore becoming symptomatic, waking me breathless, tight chested, and in a panic. Mostly I now manage to avoid blacking out, but it is the same symptoms, I am just coping better.I am just wondering if anyone else has experienced bradycardia, and has any tips for management until I see the cardiac consultant in a couple of weeks where it is looking like I may need a pacemaker for a long term solution?Any help for the short term would be much appreciated.ThanksMatt "

Heart Attack,"High heart rate, and feeling weak.","My heart rate has been quite high for 2 days now, before it started i had some dull pain on my chest, and now i feel that its kinda hard to breath. It feels like i have an air bubble on my throat or some kind of pressure. Every now and then i still get the chest pain, and sometimes a really small stinging pain in my heart. I have been quite anxious, i've stressed quite a bit too. And just recently started exercising with weights, my sleep schedule is bad too, but i've been fixing that. Im only 14, and im not obese, so what can this be? Also im feeling kind of weak and tired in the mornings more than i do usually.

Heart Attack,Some advise needed please,"I have had a lot of shooting pains in my chest and got rushed to hospital a few weeks ago. Got ECG x ray and blood tests all came back find. I am continuing getting chest pain all over shooting most of the time. The main worry is i have been up from 4am this morning, keep feeling like my heart was waking me up with a shot. I have been working at the gym the last week and usually when i leave my heart rate is 130/140 when i am cooling down and around 100 when i am not active but today it started at 110 after hard work out then within minutes the machine said 58.I was terrified, i walked staright out and never showered and went to doctors who said your fine your heart rate is 80 at the moment but i will get you a heart trace. All medical staff feel like there is nothing wrong and it could be the machine at the gym was broke but how is my heart rate down to 80 and how am i getting the pain in chest again.Doctors seem to think it is aniexty but surely it must be someway heart releted. Any advise would be great, nervous wreck and scared to sleep. "
Heart Attack,First two Stents in my heart now gull bladder someone please help me????,"Hi, my name is Melissa, I am 34 and for over one year now I have had, what felt like heart attacks to me. Almost every time I ended up in the ER with them only taking my blood and doing an EKG on me, then they would tell me to follow up with my doctor. Most of the time I made it to the ER the pain would have subsided, not this last time, it was happening to me every 30min or so and the hospital kept me inpatient for 4 days before doing tests on me. Taking a tube down my esophagus they saw scarring from acid reflex, doing an ultrasound they found stones and inflammation. They had me scheduled the next day for surgery to take my gull bladder out, however, something on my EKG made them want to check my heart at the last minute, they put dye in it and sure enough I had an 80% blockage. Now they fixed that and sent me home. I am on all kinds of meds including blood thinners, and I had an attack today that was very bad. The heart doc. said, ""No surgery for at least two months, we would like to go one year though"". So next time I have an attack I am sure I will end up in the ER and having my Gull Bladder removed. Has this happened to anyone else? How worried should I be? Please tell me what you think, as it is now, I have only had one low fat yogurt a day, for about 6 days now."
Heart Attack,enlarged heart,Is an enlarged heart classed as heart failure?
Heart Attack,Panic attack or heart problem?,"I'm a 26 year old female and have suffered with panic attacks and anxiety for about 7 years. I have had many tests over the years because of frequent PVCs, countless ECGs, echo, blood tests, 48hr monitors, all ok. On about 4 or 5 occasions in the last couple of years I have had episodes of heart racing really fast (180-200bpm) for no apparent reason. It's always been in the morning, and mostly with slight exertion like walking upstairs, hoovering etc. I know it isn't SVT because it's more of a gradual increase and decrease, and I don't think it can be atrial fibrillation as it's not irregular. I don't get any symptoms when it happens like chest pain or shortness of breath. It has lasted anything from 15 mins to 45 mins. I just don't know if it's a panic attack or something serious. Last time it happened I didnt feel overly panicky, just very aware of this fast heart rate. It also seems to fluctuate a bit, like it's coming in waves. I have done a lot of googling and can't find any particular heart problem that fits this symptom. I'm really hoping its panic attacks but there's this doubt in my mind that it could be something else and it's stopping me from living my life, I feel like I'm just waiting for it to happen again any time. Are there any heart problems that could cause this? I am fairly healthy, don't smoke, drink alcohol or caffeine, eat fairly healthy and am not overweight. I have been to the Gp and they don't really know what to say except my risk is very low. Any reassurance would be gratefully received. "
Heart Attack,"Getting a pacemaker fitted, help needed please","My son has Complete Heart Block which the specialist thinks may be congenital but as he is 36 years old and has never had any symptoms she thinks there is a chance that is aquired rather that congenital.She has told him that they will definatly need to fit a pacemaker befoe he reaches 40 but as he is having no symptoms she is happy to leave it for a while and dosnt need to see him for 12 months from his last appointment (that will be May 2015).Now the issue is that he has had an interview for his dream job and got through all the stages and had a job offer conditional on a medical.When he went for the medical he was knocked back due to the heart block as the job will involve getting a passenger vehicle license. He was told that if he had a pacemaker already fitted then there would be no issue and he would be given a start date for the job.So my question is- would it be acceptable to explain the situation to his specialist and see if she would be willing to fit the pacemaker as soon as possible. She told him in May that they may need to do it in the next 12-18 months.If not, is it possible to pay privately to get it done sooner if the specialist refuses the request."
Heart Attack,Is there a point in telling the doctor?,"A couple of days ago I told the nurse that I suspect I had a heart attack last summer.  I don't go to the docs often, and this was the first time in years, and I went due to not having been well for months.My reason for going wasn't the suspected heart attack last year, but that I've been ""knackered"" for months, with loads of fevers (and a few infections), and I was worried I had a more serious infection that just a bad tooth or eye.  But due to suspecting a heart attack last year, I thought it would be important to mention as I have also started to get head aches again, and feeling queasy.I had headaches and felt queasy for 3 weeks straight before my suspected attack.However, when I said I believed I had a heart attack last year, the nurse laughed and said ""what makes you think that at your age?"".  When I told her what had happened (I will list it on the end), she dismissed the whole notion by saying ""if you'd had a heart attack you would have called emergency services"".Truth to the told, I did not suspect a heart attack as it was happening, I though I was going to die, and the only thing on my mind was that I wasn't going to die outside Lidl!  After testing my blood pressure, which she said was high (I didn't spot the top number, but the bottom one was 96), she agreed to blood tests (this was why I'd gone in).I called today, and the receptionist said blood work was normal.Now, I have an appointment on Tuesday with a doctor.  Is there any point at all in trying to portray my worries about my heart at all?  Or will it be the same belittling treatment that I got from the nurse?  Or should I just leave it be, which to be truthful is very tempting indeed after the nurses visit?I'm not too worried at the moment if I compare how I feel now to last summer, headaches and queasiness is nowhere near what I felt like then, but my heart does occasionally beat to some funky music I clearly cannot hear.  -------------------------And incase anyone wonders, this is what happened last year, and what I was trying to tell the nurse, as she cut me off, claiming anyone that has a heart attack will immediately call for an ambulance.  *sigh*I'd been feeling unwell for about 3 weeks, headaches and feeling queasy.One the day of my suspected attack I was clammy, cold sweating and feeling worse than ever.I had just finished work, and my other half was driving us home when we stopped to get some fresh bread.The second the car had stopped, I got terrible pain in my lower left lung and left shoulder.  The pain was so severe I could only take tiny little shallow breaths.Told other half I wasn't able to go in with him, and as he shopped, all I could keep thinking was ""I am NOT gonna die outside Lidl"".We then drove home, I told other half he would have to take everything in (as I wouldn't have been able to deal with anything).Staggered though the door, took some Anadin, and just sat on the sofa.  The intense pain only lasted about 20 minutes.  After that I still felt unwell, but able to breathe fine.Next day I had a horrible tension between my shoulderblades and down the back.  Like someone had taken out a piece of my body, shrunk it and stuck it back in.Although feeling weak for weeks after, the headaches and queasiness was gone, and overall I felt much better.I did google it afterwards, and that was when I suspected it might have been a heart attack.  It was especially the sense of doom some get prior to a heart attacks that caught my eye, as the night before I had felt completely suicidal (no worries, no intention of doing it, just the urge to, as everything felt so incredily awful...  I feared someone close to me had died, and barely dared to check my phone).As I now have started to get headaches again, and feeling queasy, I do find it a little worrying, although at the moment my main worry was the constant fevers and feeling lethargic."
Heart Attack,sternum been wired 4 times.  always opens and bands cut through the bones.,"I have a chronic dehisced sternm which means it is now open after 4 repairs to rewire it.   I had open heart surgery in late 2012 and then I had the rewirings at intervals of about 5 months each.  I think I am the only one in the world with this condtion, that whatever strong wire bands they put around the sternum it just opens and the wires stay in situ and cut through the bones.  The pain is beyond belief.  I have major instability in the sternum with the clicking and sliding and I dont dare lift anything.  Shoulder and neck ache all the time and if I do anythng with my arms pain gets unbearable.  My doctor says we are waiting for a fiborous union between the bones.  It doesnt seem to be happening or it rips as soon as I use it.  Makes life difficult!  I would love to hear from anyone who had something similar.  I would love advice for how to live with this.  I feel very lost and would like to know what sort of support I should get to help me manage this.  Should I drive?  It leave me in pain but gives me the freedom I crave.  I also feel much less well than I used to much less stamina.  I wonder if this condtion has anything to do with it?"

Heart Attack,What dose my ECG mean?,"For the last five years I have been on high blood pressure medication. It has always been a problem for me as I am obese, and as I forgot to mention in my last few questions I also have diabetes. I made the stupid mistake of quitting both my diabetes meds and my high blood pressure meds. I suppose this was part of a new ‘natural medicine’ craze. Yes I know I am stupid for doing that, however, I am on them again as not taking them really didn't help. The problem is that for the last few days I feel like I felt like I was getting a cold but it never eventuated, my chest felt tight and painful, I had a strange pain in my jaw and my left hand was achy and tingly, not to mention my breathing is really laboured. So I went to the doctor and I had an ECG taken. My doctor was on call so she had to leave half way through, so the nurse gave me the reading when it was done. I took a picture on my phone and cropped it a bit so you can read it. The nurse said she didn't really know how to read them so she just gave it to me and made me an appointment for tomorrow. I am feeling worse now and really want to know what it means. "

Heart Attack,is it normal for a 17 year old to have a resting pulse of around 90-110?,"Hello, I'm 17 and I've always had quite a rapid pulse throughout my life. 2 years ago I went to the doctors about this problem because I was becoming increasingly concerned about it. I got an ECG done and the doctor said it looked fine but however referred me to the cardiology unit in the nearest hospital. I had some tests done and everything seemed to be okay but my pulse was very rapid.     I do believe that I suffer from anxiety and was wondering if anxiety can cause a rapid pulse even when resting? could it be something serious? I have  had some palpitations recently and my resting pulse is around 90-110. The more I focus on it, the more I worry/get paranoid. I have read that having a constant rapid pulse can increase the chances of sudden cardiac death and heart attacks, I just need a rational perspective on the subject or someone else's opinionThank you.

Heart Attack,heart palpitations ,Hi I have been having palpitations since October last year doctor says they are nothing to worry about I was wondering if anyone knows if its ok to anadin extra for muscle pain when you have palpitations I'm unsure because they contain caffeine                                                                                                   I'm 26 and was diagnosed with the above after having my daughter in july 09', I've been looking for anyone in the uk with a similar experience ever since and this is the closest i've come, although my situation seems slightly different from all of yours i guess no ones is the same.                              My consultant say's my cardiomyopathy was caused due to the delivery of my daughter, and my blood pressure was so high it was luckily diagnosed straight away before leaving hospital with her, he also say's it can just one day repair itself which i find very confusing, nearly all of my questions to him get answered with 'we don't know' which is very frustrating.                 My EF in hospital was 10% and at my last echo was 28% so in 15 months it has improved but the doctors want my medication increasing on evry visit which again, i find very confusing but go along with what they say as what other chioce do we have, however saying that i refuse to put my life on hold for example they say i shouldn't fly or leave the country but am looking forward to a family holiday in 2 weeks to Gran Canaria, on that final happy note i thank you all for listening and hope to hear from someone soon.   Sam. X"
Heart Attack,Does anyone have any ideas of what is wrong?,"I woke in the middle of the night around 2 weeks ago and felt as if my heart was not pumping correctly to provide my body with enough oxygen (despite feeling like it was beating with a strong pulse), and my face went tingly...I sat up and woke my partner, but within a minute of sitting on the edge of the bed, I passed out. I came too with sharp pain in my left abdomen and fever like symptoms (white as a sheet, sweating, shaky). The paramedic put me on an ECG, but nothing was found, abdominal pain didn't seem to be a concern to them. Since then, this has happened a few more times, but i have managed to stay flat and breath deeply for 10 minutes which seems to get rid of it without passing out again. I have a friend who works in cardiology, so i had a monitor on for 5 days where they found nocturnal bradycardia, sinus arrythmia and a few paced beats, but on the whole, nothing too concrete. I have had an Echogram done also, where the doctor assured me i have a strong, healthy heart and everything is in order. I have been taking my blood pressure over the time also, and now need to perform a tilt test as the next step in working out what the issue is...My blood pressure average has been around 140 over 60 with a heart rate of 42 (much lower than my normal resting rate). I am concerned as i have not felt right for a few weeks now... Could this be a virus, panic attacks, or something more serious? I am 26, fit and healthy, eat pretty well, don't drink abnormal amounts....Is there anything else i need to look into for a possible cause rather than just my heart? Any help on this would be greatly appreciated...."

Heart Attack,Had a very serious reaction to Persantine during a heart test.,"changed doctors and the new Cardiologist thinks I was just nervous when I told him I had passed out and had to be given an antidote by a Dr. who told me mine was the worst reaction he had ever seen.This new Cardiologist is almost bullying me into taking stress tests that will require a Cardiolite               injection, and possibly Persantine as well.  I had an Angiogram six months ago which showed (what I was told) I had a young heart but a mild    valve problem, and to have a follow up in 6 months.  The follow up cardiogram showed a worsened valve problem, hence this new round of tests.   I am 85--do I risk these nuclear drug tests or let           nature take its course?  "

When i came home the symptoms reappeared and they were worse next day again to hospital, i told them that i can't breathe and i feel very weak but no they told me im fine and i need some relaxing pills. I left the hospital and went to a private cardiologist. There i took a EKG and a black and white echocardiography the cardiologist told me that i have tachycardia and probably right bundle branch block. She prescribed me some vitamins and some calcium. I took them and felt a little better for a while until a few days ago when i started to feel bad again. Now i'm staying in bed and i can barely breath and i have to use my mouth from time to time to take air.When im awake i can adjust  my breathing but when i sleep i can't  so i often weak up with my head or even my whole body numb.

Here's my story...I'm 24, sept just gone I had tonsillitis, I started having really bad chest pains I couldn't breath and had a weird pain in my arms, I went into hospital where at first they just thought maybe I was allergic to penicillin, after a number of tests I was transferred to a specialist heart hosp, after all my tests and MRI scan it was confirmed that the tonsillitis had resulted in me having myo and pericarditis, the whole experience was such a shock to me, I wasn't even allowed to walk to the toilet, I was released from hospital after nearly two weeks and have been on pills ever since, I have an MRI check up scan next week and have only really started thinking about the whole thing and realised, I actually don't really know after deal about it, I no what it is and why it happened but I don't actually no if it's a long term thing or if il be okay, if anything in my life will be affected by it. Isit gone? Can it come back? My partner and I would like to start trying for a baby, in the back of my head I'm worrying about all of this. Should it be an issue?!?

Heart Attack,need to talk to people going through the same!,"Our son was diagnosed with Tetralogy of fallot 6 weeks ago at 3 and a half months after a trip to the GP with a bad cough and chest infection.  We were sent to our local hospital from the GP surgery and then sent to Alder Hey the next day where he was diagnosed after a scan.  He hasn't had any blue spells and feeds really well - he is a very good weight for his age.  We came home from hospital after 2 weeks of monitoring and he is now on propranalol 3 times a day.  He has been back to clinic since and they were pleased with him and hope to wait until he is 12 months before doing surgery. He will need to go back to clinic every 6-8 weeks. He also has a nurse visit at home every 2 weeks to check his SATS are ok and so far they have been fine.The thing is, even though the doctors are all pleased with him and happy for him to carry on at home - I just can't stop worrying about it.  We have put him in his own room at night now and I feel so guilty!  I lie awake wondering if he is ok and checking on him all the time.  Every time he crys I worry thet he's having a spell or that he might turn blue.  I was so happy when we came home from hospital but it's just hit me all of a sudden this week - I spent all day yesterday sobbing!!!  I don't feel like I can talk to my parents as they are very emotional about the situation and i don't want to upset them and whenever I mention it to my husband he just says \""he will be fine\""  but will he I wonder?  I wish i was coping better for his sake because I just want him to be treated normally by everyone and enjoy being a normal baby.  It would be good to hear from anyone going through the same thing or anyone who has been through this situation."

Heart Attack,Aortic Stenosis,My son was born with Aortic Stenosis. Throughout my pregnancy i had no idea that there was anything wrong with my baby as no checks in the later stages of my pregnancy were done. In the hours that followed my son’s birth he was monitored in the usual way. It was when my son was 15 hours old that my husband and I were told there was a problem with my son. The hospital where he was born did not have the best equipment to help with a diagnosis. So my son was shipped to the nearest hospital in a incubator for a echo scan the following day. It was here that it was discovered that he had aortic stenosis. We were given our options (one was a balloon catheter and the other was open heart surgery). We decided that we would go for the less intrusive option so we would always have the open heart surgery to fall back on should the first option not work. When my son was 6 days old he had his operation. The staffs were amazing at the hospital and explained everything that was happening. My son is now 13 months old and still having regular check ups to check that his heart has not tried to heal itself.

Heart Attack,Sick Sinus Syndrome On a visit to China last year I decided to have an healt...,"On a visit to China last year I decided to have an health check, which included a total MRI scan, cardiac ultrasound scan, blood tests, barium meal etc. Unfortunately they found I was suffering from several problems, including bradycardia, low glucose tolerance, thickened septum in heart, swollen duodenum, too much uric acid in blood.They told me I should lose weight, take more exercise and moderate my diet. I am now just over 15 stone - height 6foot 2"". Age 59.  About three months later I started having palpitations from around 7 in the morning for two hours and then about 2-3 hours from around 4pm.Initially I went to an A&E where after an ECG I was told that it was normal- which regarding the irregularity it was at the time of the ECG. From around 4 hours a day the palpitations grew to most of my waking hours and were there if I woke during the night.My GP was able to catch it on an ECG and referred me to a cardiologist.17 weeks for NHS 3 weeks privately, I booked a private appointment.I went to a chinese doctor friend of mine who gave me a herbal mixture to be taken twice a day. After about 2 days the episodes started to decrease until they were only around 15 minutes per day- usually in the evening.Christmas came, the chinese doctor had a baby and I was in bed for a week with a cpmpressed sciatic nerve.after Christmas I stopped taking the herbs mainly in order to display the symptoms to the specialist.The palpitations came back. One time I felt so faint and dizzy and short of breath I went to the A&E again,the nurses quickly did an ECG and the doctor - (a consultant from her badge )told me that it was normal.I said that it could not be normal and if she thought it was she needed re-training.She asked if my GP had ordered a 24 hour heart monitor and when I told her no, she ordered one for the next day.The results were sent to the cardiolist who I saw four days later.Three minute examination with stethoscope, a look at the ECG taken 30 minutes earlier, then told me I would probably need a pacemaker sooner or later to treat Sick Sinus Syndrome.He suggested I should come back in 3 months, which pleased me because it obviously wasnt serious.The next few days I continued to have a lot of palpitations together with giddiness, a vacant sort of feeling and sometimes unable to converse normally.I also seemed to have to try to take deep breaths at this time.I had started to read about Sick sinus syndrome and discovered that there were tests availble to try to ascertain the cause and some drugs that could help.When my GP(who has spent 2 years in a Cardiolgy unit) saw the results of the 24 hour monitor he told me he was surprised that the consultant had called 6080 atrial.......? moderate. He was also surprised that nothing was suggested except  a 3month appointment. He told me that with this condition it could deteriote quickly.He also told me that I should not do any strenuos exercise.I asked to see another specialist which he referred me to.One months wait to see him privately.I startd again with the Chinese herbal mixture. After two weeks the episodes have almost finished. Some days I have had none, other days maybe 15 minutes.She tells me that the sinus poblem is treatable but I should be careful because the ECGs show that the ""T"" wave shows that all is not well with my heart.For maybe 2 years before I had the health check in China I would awake with a nervous feeling in my Chest/stomach. I could never understand this  but put it down to a symptom of stress. Now I think it was connected to the Bradycardia and may have been an initial symptom because I have that same feeling when I have an episode but do not now wake up with it.I have found that lying on my left side will prompt them to begin and also I feel that sugar level may have some bearing.I have given up tea and coffee which I am sure aggravated the situation.I have decided to take a trip to China where in a first class hospital tests are done immediately.I have found your pages helpful, thank you, from my experience as you can see I have found the medical profession sadly lacking and hope it improves in the future.Rodney Randle [i:25fdafb7a3]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:25fdafb7a3]"
Heart Attack,Living at home alone,"Several months ago I had a minor heart attack and have since been diagnosed with heart disease.  I currently live alone and ideally would like to stay living at home.  I have family and friends fairly nearby, on whom I can rely for help.  However, I have recently had chats with other elderly friends who have mentioned the benefits of telehealth.  I would be interested in finding out more - can anyone provide me with some advice / information?  "
Heart Attack,Verapamil cluster headaches,"I have been experiencing cluster headaches since I was about 16 years old. I am now 30. I also am on verapimil. Currently I am in a cycle that has not beem interrupted in about 9 months. Aside from the verapimil, which my doctor is uping the dosage, I also take imitrex injections as I need them.The verapimil seems to be helping with not only the severity of me headaches, but also with their frequency. I sure hope the larger dosage will get a better grasp on them.[i:8c28257e69]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:8c28257e69]"

Heart Attack,Myocarditis Feel like no-one takes me seriously,"Hi, Wondering if anyone can help. I first had chest pain in May 2006. Went to doc who sent me for tests at hospital-ecg,blood,chest x-ray. Nothing found and told probably stress. Pain seemed to go on it's own so thought nothing of it. But about 5 weeks ago had occassional pain again. Went straight to doc who did BP which was high and racing heart. He told me he would refer me to consultant. In meantime felt so unwell I went to A&E who did usual ecg,chest x-ray,pulse,BP. Saw doc who may as well of patted me on the head like a good girl and he told me to go home as he could not diagnose anything!!! Been to see consultant twice now. Had blood tests today, CT scan yesterday, lung breathing tests last week. Consultant still seems to put it down to stress. I have been off work for 4 weeks nearly and I am not stressed. Now in nearly constant pain not just occassional, tired, breathless, dizzy, racing pulse etc. What do I have to do to be taken seriously? Feel like I will never get anywhere. After my mum researched myocarditis on the internet WE suggested to the consultant that it may be that. Again...........he thinks stress. The stress of getting someone to take me seriously cannot be helping. Can anyone help? Getting desperate."

Heart Attack,I was diagnosed with pericaritis at a hospital in Jan 20...,"I was diagnosed with pericaritis at a hospital in Jan 2000 after being sent home by a GP who thought I'd pulled a muscle in my chest. I'd never been in as much pain. since then, I've had bouts lasting usually about a week, a few times a year, usually following a cold. I've now had it for over three weeks and have had a mild fever of around 99-101 degrees F. I've now been signed off work for a week. None of the anti-inflam medication seems to be working. Neither did the steroids. The painkillers the doctor gave me sent me doolally, and paracetamol don't touch the pain. i'm at a loss as to what to do as this is preventing me from carrying on normally. I have a daughter who's nearly three and a house to run.[i:3db097472e]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:3db097472e]"
Heart Attack,Do I have Heart Failure?,"I had a heart attack twelve years ago.  I am now 59.  I take the usual cocktail of drugs including Bisoprolol (only recently changed to this), Atorvastatin 80Mg, Clopidogrel and Valsartan.  I was only put on the Valsartan about 2 years ago and I'm sure my GP said at the time it would minimise the effects of my heart failure.8 years ago I weighed 14 stone, drank too much beer and ate far too many salted nuts.  A also smoked at least 20 cigs a day and did little proper exercise.  On a treadmill test I did 13+ minutes before I asked them to stop the test because I was shattered.I stopped smoking last Autumn. This pushed me into a depression.  As I was coming out of this in early Spring '08, I had a stroke.  I seem to have got away with most of it and only have a bit of residual numbness in my hand and face.  For the last three years I have eaten healthily, drunk only red wine, (though probably a bit too much) swum at least 2 kilometres per week. (in bite sized chunks) and walked miles and miles.I can easily walk 15-20 miles in a day, but can't run for a bus. I also do som gentle weight training with 3Kg weights.But..I have had a few episodes of breathlessness, so my Doc referred me back to Cardiology.I had an Echocardiogram but have had no results.  I had another exercise test which lasted only 5 minutes before they stopped it.  I was absolutely gasping for breath.  Finally, I had another angiogram.  The Cardiologist who did it said there was no change since my last one about 8 years ago, but I could clearly see more damage to the affected artery.They said the artery (which feeds my left ventricle) is beyond stent/angioplasty treatment and is not worth by-passing because the left ventricular muscle it is feeding is pretty much dead.So, it looks as though the only viable treatment would be a transplant, and I can't see a 60 year old being anywhere near the top of anybody's list for that.There has clearly been a quite dramatic deterioration to my heart, as even though I am living much more healthily now, my performance is well down.Heart Failure is a very scary and progressive condition for which there is no cure.  If I have it, my understanding is that I'll be lucky to last five years.  I'm at my wits end with this and although I was previously very positive about my heart condition, I am now very scared.I don't get to see my consultant until Nov. 20th, which is way too long to be worrying like this.Does my condition sound like heart failure?Arch"
Heart Attack,myocardialinfarction,"My Mum was the world to me and I saw her everyday we went walking and she seemed very fit for her age she didn't smoke or drink. A day after her birthday we were out walking and she was just fine chatting away as we always did, when she went very quiet and complained of indegestion I was joing and asked if she had a pain in her left arm she said no so I said that it wasn't a heart attack HOW WRONG COULD I BE!! 2 minutes later she started being sick anfd then had a massive heart atttack.. I Just cant believe this has happened and I relive those final moments over and over again if love could have saved her it would've and I just dont think I willl ever get over losing my fantastic mum and best friend...Mum I will love you forever"
Heart Attack,I am 65 years old and over the past 10/15 years I have s...,"I am 65 years old and over the past 10/15 years I have suffered from shortness of breath under exertion, and pains/aches in the chest, again upon walking uphill or exertion. My local Cardiologist has treated me for the past 10  years with medication and has managed to control the breathlessnes.He has allways said that eventually I would need heart surgery if there was signs of deterioration,and has intimated that septal ablation was going to be the way to go.Because of my worsening condition he decidedin October 2005 that now was the the time to go for alcohol septal ablation procedure,wheels where then set in motion for me to attend the London Chest hospital and to have the procedure done by Mr Charles Knight who is renowned as being the No. 1 in performing this procedure.  I was admitted to the London Chest[after travelling from Hartlepool and having to arrange accomodation for my wife during my stay] on March 6th. 2006 and after all the preparatory tests ie ECG,Ultra sound scans,blood tests, etc, etc,it was agreed to go ahead with the procedure,on the 7th March. Naturally I was extremely apprehensive prior to the procedure,but the assurances of the Cardiologist and other hospital doctors gave me the strength and courage to agree to the procedure. I was monitored in CCU for 3/4 days after the procedure and discharged on Monday 13th March,to have follow up at James Cook hospital Middlesbrough,under the care of Cardiologist Mr J. Hall. At the moment I have not experienced any problems,as I am taking it easy at home. I will not know if I require a pacemaker until follow up tests have been performed over the next 2 weeks. Hopefully I will be able to get on with my life in a normal way a 65 year old man does in 2 or 3 weeks time.Everything looks positive at the moment.:D[i:883f31eb3d]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:883f31eb3d]"
Heart Attack,Feeding a baby with fallots,"Hi, I am interested to hear from anyone who has had difficulties feeding their baby. Our daughter was feeding really well for the first 8/9 weeks and then all of a sudden is not feeding very well during the day time (although not so much of a problem during the night). I am breastfeeding her and suspect that she is tiring easily. We will speak to the cardiologist about this at our next visit but was wondering if anyone else had experienced similar problems? Might bottle feeding be less tiring for her? Any hints or tips to make sure she is getting enough food and putting on weight would be appreciated. Thanks, Rachael"
Heart Attack,"My son was born 29/11/03, diagnosed approx 16 hours later Transposition Of Great Arteries","My son was born 29/11/03, diagnosed approx 16 hours later with TGA. Underwent balloon septstimy 1 day old and had a successful arterial switch @ 10 days old , both ops took place at Newcastle Freeman Hospital. He has had 2 further check ups at the Freeman and he does not have to go back until Aug 2006 which we are all happy about. I am extremley happy with the Doctors & Nurses at the Freeman and grateful to tthem all for the care and attention he received. He has had no illness since and very very rarely gets coughs and cold. To me hes just a normal little boy with a ""war wound"" on his chest. The only thing I am concerned about is his later years ie say age 8 upwards, can he play football? will he need more surgery? these questions keep going round and round in my head.[i:7b0918a25c]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:7b0918a25c]"

We are over the initial shock.  We are also over asking all the questions like, 'why is this happening to us?'What is scaring us out of our wits now is the possibility of Tets Spells, also called Blue Spells or Hypoxic Spells.Has anyone else had an experience of these?  How did you identify them?  When our daughter is having her nappy changed or is having her clothing changed she cries and goes blue.  We were told to expect this, but is this classed as a Blue Spell?[i:11d4e0efc5]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:11d4e0efc5]"
