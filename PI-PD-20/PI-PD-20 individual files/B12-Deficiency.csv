B12 Deficiency,Low b12,my b12 level is 374. is that low enough to make me feel like im going nuts with severe anxiety and depression ?
B12 Deficiency,ADVICE ON LOW VITAMIN B12,"Hello Hope I am on the right forum. I am female aged 71 years. I have osteo arthritis,mild asthma, rhinitis,glaucoma, IBS, Diverticular disease and mild gastritis. I also have an underactive thyroid for around 28 years. Recently I saw a consultant Rheumatologist and have been given a diagnosis of mild fibromyalgia as well as the arthritis. All blood tests were fine, also tested for inflammatory markers which were negative. The consultant found on their computer some blood testsresults of 2017 /2018 which showed a slightly reduced level of B12. I found this strange that it had not been picked up at the time especially as I have yearly blood tests. I have always been told B12 was fine. My aunt had both rheumatoid arthritis and PA. My son has type 1 Diabetes. Knowing these things can be connected I was wondering if anyone would have an opinion. My recent test done a week ago was 134 and described as mildly reduced level and to see GP for supplementation. I will no doubt get a call from the surgery this week as they will have received the letter I also received on Saturday. One thing I have concern about is the thyroid should I ask for a full thyroid function test even though my TSH was with in normal levels 2. something. Next Blood test due around September. The other thing is that I have been taking Ranitidine for the gastritis for around 18months. I read that this class of acid reducers like PPI's can affect the B12 levels. Should I ask to be taken off them. Any advice or information would be welcome. Many thanks."
B12 Deficiency,Canker sires in mouth and burning gums,i was diagnosed with PA many years ago but recently have been constantly getting ulcers on my tongue and burning gums. ive read that having PA can contribute to getting this. Just wondering if anyone else has this problem?
B12 Deficiency,"My B12 serum levels are high, yet my cobalt levels (in hair) are low. What does this mean?","I got my hair mineral analysis test and my cobalt levels were lower than the normal range. However, when I tested my B12 levels, they were above normal (most likely a result of me supplementing B12). Any explanation for this, considering cobalt is a component of B12 and low cobalt levels could possibly lead to anemia?"
B12 Deficiency,B12 level of 115,"Got routine blood tests done and B12 came back at 115. Have only yesterday completed the loading dose of 6 injections, I feel quite weird! Is that normal? Headache, general fatigue, tender tongue, tingling here and there intermittently. Bizarre..."
B12 Deficiency,How long does it take for MMA blood test results,"For the past 18 months I haven't felt right to start with it was tiredness, occasionally feeling sick and lightheaded but back in July while eating my dinner my chin and one side of my face went numb. Since then i have suffered every day with all of the symptoms connected to b12 deficiency. I have has several serum b12 tests which always come back in the normal reference range but at the low end. 263 pg/ml, 320 pg/ml and 268 pg/ml my GP has said that as my levels are in the normal range deficiency is impossible. i also suffer with my stomach which has led to weight loss. ive had MRI scans, countless blood tests, 24 hour ECG and various other tests which have all come back clear or normal. The only thing that was picked up was a vit D deficiency which my GP said was causing all of my symptoms, this has now been corrected and my levels are back to normal but i am still very unwell and none of the symptoms have gone. I collapsed while in with my GP and she reluctantly agreed to test my b12 again along side MMA after i practically begged her to carry out the test.i am really struggling have been signed off work for the last 6weeks and my period makes everything worse.i had the MMA blood test over 2 weeks ago and wanted to know if anyone knows how ling this test takes to come back as i am struggling to cope now."
B12 Deficiency,Is this a VITAMIN b12 problem?,"20 year old male from INDIA8 months ago i was diagnosed with a b12 and D problem(very low levels)Levels were VITAMIN D : 42.7 nmol/L (75-250 range)VITAMIN B12: 119 pg/mL (211-911 range)After getting 4 shots and supplementing(mbalmin 500mcg) for 8 months my B12 levels have risen to 272 pg/mli find this surprising as i eat a lot of MEAT and EGGS on a daily basis.I have the typical symptoms of b12 deficiency like Fatigue ,Tingling in hands etcThe problem is doctor told me that just because 272 is in the range,it is normal and i shouldnt worry.Reading up on b12 has made me realize that this is a true low level despite being in the range.The doctor even told me that this level is common for people. What kind of doctor should i go to ?Who will take this problem seriously? Should i go to a blood disorder doctor? The general physician who originally diagnosed me didnt even wanted to get me on shots just supplements . WHAT SUGGESTIONS WOULD YOU GUYS GIVE,DOES IT SEEM LIKE A b12 problem or overthinking?"
B12 Deficiency,"I don’t test low on B12 or pernicious anaemia, but need B12 shots to feel better - what does it mean","I am getting B12 shots done privately as my tests dont qualify to get any from my GPs.My B12 tests have always come back fine over the years, but I have always taken B12 pills so i've never been able to have a true test done. Obviously the pills don't help me all that much, but just a little if I take it consistently.My doctor had a test done for intrinisic factor when I told her I was getting private B12 shots done as she said it's a shame i'm paying for them & actually wanted to help me get them on the NHS if I qualified. The test came back negative though & she couldn't explain why I feel a difference from B12 shots.I feel absolutely exhausted most of the time, have mind fog constantly & can't focus & when it gets really severe it's almost like i'm drifting in & out of consciousness from heavy exhaustion when I try to wake up.Having a B12 shot makes me feel human within days & it is such a dramatic & unmistakeable difference in quality of life for me. What exactly is going on if i'm not testing low on B12 or have pernicious aneamia according to the tests?I also have an underactive thyroid which is controlled with medication & seems to be stable these days."
B12 Deficiency,B12 Injections,"HI,For approximately three years I have had my B12 on a ten weekly basis.My GP's practice informed today I should be on a 12 week cycle. 12 weeks is unacceptable as the chronic exhaustion, palpitations, depression and lack of clarity of thought is debilitating .Previously, seen three GP's, all quote the NICE guidelines which state 12 weeks.My question is has anybody overcome this issue and managed to maintain a 10 weekly cycle?"
B12 Deficiency,Ms,"I have b12 jabs every 10weeks but after only 2 weeks of having the jab i have white marks on my finger nails and I'm still so tired. I am 65 and have been having these jabs since i was 45 after being rushed to hospital, them thinking i had crones."
B12 Deficiency,B12 injections and spots,Hi asking a question on behalf of my daughter. she has recently been diagnosed with b12 defficiency and they think the diet related kind. she has had her course of injections and altered her diet but she is still not right yet. night swears continue to be a problembut the most upsetting things for her is that her normally clear skin is now spotty and also on her chest. shes a beauty therapist and nothing she does seems to help. the gp has given her some cream but not done anything as yet. is this likely to be forever?
B12 Deficiency,Extremely low folic acid and fairly low b12,"Hi, I was diagnosed with pernicious anemia about 10 years ago when my b12 level was only around 90.I was on monthly b12 injections of hydroxocobalamin.I have recently moved home and moved GP. The practice nurse questioned why i need b12 injections for so long and I was sent for a blood test.My levels came back as b12 219 and folic acid was severely low at level 1... the doctor (always a different doctor) told me that my b12 level is fine at 219 but said my folic acid is the lowest level he has ever seen in all his years as a GP. He put me on daily folic acid as well as vit D which was also very low.I am very concerned as I thought folic acid works alongside with b12 but my injections have been stopped. I do not think my b12 level is as high as it should be and I am so worried about the neurological effects of not having enough b12. When i was diagnosed 10 years ago I was so very poorly, could hardly walk upstairs, had to crawl up, my memory was terrible, I was under neurology at my local hospital who put me on monthly b12 injections as I was so ill with it..... No one at this new surgery has explained why my folic acid is so low... could it be connected to the previous pernicious anemia?Any advice would be so great, so worried...thank you. Lou x"
B12 Deficiency,High level of vitamin b12,I'm diabetic for over 32 years and till 2016 I was 70lbs over weigh.that year I had a bariatric surgery and lost over 70lbs.My doctor prescribed vitamin b12 c and d.My test on vitamin b12 has show an increase level since 2017 from 294 to 832 last week.I stop taking any vitamin for over 6 months. vitamin d is a little under the normal but b12 every year it goes up.I was told that bariatric surgery will create a deficiency not an increase. is this something I should worry about. I suppose to see the doctor in 2 weeks but till then I'm really worried because all I can find on Google is liver or kidney disease or worst cancer
B12 Deficiency,B supplements and edoxaban,"Hi, have symptoms of low B12 and have brought a Vitamin B complex supplement to try. Have taken PPI for 15 plus years also have IBS. My question is given I am on a blood thinner are B vit supplements safe to take. There are so many things I can't use. Can't see anything on Google about interactions. Thanks"
B12 Deficiency,"Feeling flu like, nauseous, migraines after b12 injections help please ","HeySo iv been getting loading doses for B12 deficiency, my b12 was 105 improved to 124 after a month and a half of eating more meat than a cow has at doctors advice... I am being tested for coeliac and my thyroid is wonky but not getting retested till july. Unsure yet if b12 will be continued or is only a loading dose. initially he wanted me to do 4 x doses for 2 weeks but im self employed so compromised with 2 x a week.I have Ankolysing spondalytis, a hip replacement Fybro like pains, EDS hyper mobility - so major immune crap reallymedication wise all im really taking is Embrel by injection, Arcoxia when needed and my contraception pill. I cant take paracetamol etc right now it makes me nauseous.So first loading dose i had a cold so assumed the symptoms on the next morning were related to that - flue like head stiffness overall weakness. the next day was fairly fine.second dose felt sick almost 10 mins after the dose couldnt life my head up when curled on seat for hours couldnt be vertical etc.Third dose symptoms returned so i knew it was b12 but yesterdays dose is horrendous, my arms are now like lead balloons like when u get a flu jag, both are red occasionally nippy but always aware of them, i feel sick constantly col fevery migraine and generally feelig pretty rough but trying to not waste two days as i feel like iv wasted 2 weeks.Overall i dont feel any better, my hands still tingle feet tingle, random swelling reactions hair is breaking worse but unfortunately that could all be also the thyroid.Has anyone ever experienced feeling like this with b12 injections. I have two doses left on loading but i cant take any time off after them. one is on tuesday im working 16 hour days wed and thursday. im expecting to feel even worse with each dose. im unsure if its my immune system playing havoc or im generally reacting to the actual b12. ITs Hydroxycobalamin im getting.any general idea of how yoru meant to feel would be really appreciated thank you x"

B12 Deficiency,Pernicious anemia and b12 deficiency help ,"I’m looking for some advice on pernicious anemia and vitamin b12 deficiency. I am a 28 year old female. About 2 years ago I went to the doctors with a cut on the corner of my mouth, they prescribed me antibiotic creams and thrush creams but it didn’t clear so they took my bloods and the results came back as slightly low in b12 and iron so they prescribed me some vitamins which I took but they didn’t really make much difference.After this I just left it and didn’t go back to the doctors but started noticing more symptoms. I have pins and needles in my hands and feet which are always cold, very dry skin on my face, an extremely itchy and flaky scalp, hair loss, hair seems to be greying quite rapidly, angular chellitis that comes for a few month then clears and then comes back again, a constant sore tongue, sometimes get a numb tingling sensation in tongue, burning sensation on skin on legs, flaky fingernails with vertical ridges, long spells of constipation followed by diarrhoea, spells of tiredness, low mood but I suffer sever mental health issues so this is normal for me.A couple of weeks ago I mention it to the doctor that symptoms hadn’t cleared and seemed to have worsened so they took my bloods again but this time the results have come back all clear and no further action needs to be taken yet I am left with all these symptoms... I am very confused. these are the test that my doctor requested:CRP, full blood count, ferritin (CO_VIT=No), hba1c, liver profile, magnesium (MG2+), renal profile, throid function test (CO_PITF=No(CL_TME=0))would these tests pick up low b12 or PA. Should I request to have my bloods redone or are there particular tests that I need to request? I’m certain that I have some sort of b12 deficiency related illness. Any advice would be appreciated! Thank you."
B12 Deficiency,Active B12 ,My B12 levels were 281 last September. Ive recently had my ACTIVE B12 levels tested privately and they were 68.6 pmol/l with the range being 37.5 - 188.Before the test I was supplementing with 1000mcg sublingual B12 but stopped 2 weeks before.Is my active B12 test low?
B12 Deficiency,Numbness at B12 injection site,"hi,So for the past few months i have been giving myself vitamin B12 injections . i started out with once a week then every other week and then every 3rd week. I inject into my thighs alternating each one. my last injection was about 3 weeks ago and my thigh is completley numb where the injection was, a circle right around the area. Im a but nervous as that feeling has not gotten better or anything. Has anyone experiences this at all? I have not been able to find anything or anyone who has had this!"
B12 Deficiency,"Low/normal B12, IM shots, and ongoing symptoms","Hi, I'm sure my questions have already been asked so I apologise in advance.In early 2018, after almost 2 years of increasing symptoms such as brain fog, fatigue, interrupted sleep, decreased sense of smell and taste, and burning feet accompanied with a sensation of wearing stockings to the knee and long gloves, I was told my B12 serum levels were 220 pmol/L and B12 active levels 41 pmol/L.My GP is proactive and commenced 1000 mcg IM methyl shots immediately with a schedule of 1 shot every 3 weeks for 9 weeks; then once a month. 4-5 months after my first shot I felt no real improvement had occurred and asked to have shots every 2 weeks, which my GP agreed to. This continued for appx 6 weeks when I got sick of attending the surgery and requested they show me how to administer the shots myself, which they did. Thankfully I'm in Australia so can purchase ampules over the counter at a chemist, and can get free injecting equipment through a health organisation. I self administered every 10 days for 8 weeks. By then my B12 levels were well over 1000 pmol/L and have remained there. I subsequently stopped having the shots as I appear to be maintaining levels adequately. I was also taking 5000mcg of Methyl B12 sublingual tabs daily along with a B complex, fish oil, zinc and joint pain supplements (dodgy knees). I continue to supplement regularly although not to such high levels.In April 2018 I asked my doctor to review previous blood tests to check whether my B12 had ever been tested before as my symptoms had progressed considerably - it turns out it had been in Dec 2016 when I first went to get my issue of numb toes checked out. My levels back then were 198 pmol/L and 39 pmol/L for serum and active forms respectively. These results were never followed up by my GP at the time and I was completely unaware of them until April 2018 . At the time they had concerns it may have been MS as my sister suffers from the disease.I have also had my children tested as I was concerned that this may have been a dietary issue. My youngest two tested in the low to mid 300's. I supplement them occasionally as a result as there is a chance they're not getting enough from their food.Over the last 3-4 weeks I've noticed a significant return of the burning feet and stockinged legs/arms sensation, particularly of a night time. I live in a tropical area of Australia and have noticed this seems to occur when the weather heats up. The brain fog is almost non-existent and my sleeping patterns have improved significantly. My memory however still has some gaping holes in it and I continue to struggle with retention of information.I've also recently discovered I'm massively deficient in Vit D, which surprised me as I live in a place with almost constant sunshine (not as great as it sounds I might add!). It seems the Slip/Slop/Slap skin cancer campaigns have really paid off and we are a nation of increasingly Vit D deficient people.I have had 2 MRI's that were clear of MS, stroke, tumour, any form of demyelation disorder, spinal cord compression, and cauda equina. I saw two different neuro's who tried to convince me it was anxiety and wanted to treat me with anti depressants and then suggested I visit a psychologist. I went to see a psychologist who rejected the anxiety theory (as had I) but they suggested it could be fibromyalgia. My GP rejected this suggestion and frankly I'm dubious myself. I've had STI checks; urine protein checks; autoimmune checks for lupus, Sjogren syndrome, RA etc; diabetes; iron studies; MMA (after supplementation unfortunately); thyroid function; coeliac disease; intrinsic factor and routine bloods/chemistry checks. With the exception of a slightly abnormal liver function (ALT) test, all have been clear and normal. I'm not pre-menopausal. I am visiting my Dr again soon for follow up tests to check B12 & Vit D levels. I'm now also seriously considering environmental factors such as adult onset allergies, or some sort of contamination. The last I doubt is an issue as my children don't appear to be affected.So finally to my question(s) - from the past experience of other B12 low/deficient patients:Hopefully someone is still reading this....Many thanks in advance!"
B12 Deficiency,B12 injections and neurological symptoms,"Every day for 2.5 months, I've had paresthesia/neuropathy (in other words pins and needles, tingling, generally weird sensations) in both feet and both legs. My B12 was tested and isn't ""drastically"" low (275), but still low to where my doctor says B12 deficiency could definitely be causing these symptoms.I've started a B12 injection regimen where I get two a week for 4 weeks, then once a week for another 4 weeks, then once every two weeks for a month (and as needed from there on out, I assume). So far, I've had the first 6 injections, over a period of 19 days. But here's my question - can it be normal that so far I've felt little, if any, improvement? A little more background - my first 3 shots were given under the skin, and it was as if I never got the injections. I didn't feel better, I didn't feel worse, nothing. Starting with the 4th shot, they've been giving them to me into the muscle. Now at least I can tell there's some sort of ""reaction"" going on. After each of the past 3 shots I've felt very tired the day of the shot. Also, the day after the shots my symptoms have been extra bad - really magnified. And one day I even had new stuff going on like burning wrists, feeling wiped out, etc... that didn't last more than one day. But through all this, even though I'm glad to at least feel SOMETHING is happening after the shots, I still can't say that I'm ""better."" I've read neurological symptoms can take the longest to improve and heal, and I'm hoping this is the case for me. Otherwise I'll start worrying all over again that this is NOT due to B12, and instead is something more sinister, like MS. Although at this point, my doctor doesn't think so. Help! Does anyone have any insight on symptoms like mine when it comes to B12 deficiency, and how it all relates to B12 injections and improvement time?Thanks so much."
B12 Deficiency,Hematologist?,"As I wrote a couple of weeks ago, I was diagnosed with low B12 in 2016 and have been getting bi-weekly shots for about 2 years (was monthly in 2016 and early 2017).My doctors have been running more tests to figure out the cause, and here are the latest results:MCHC 32.2 g/Dl lower than normal (Range 32.3-36.5)Folate: 2.9 ng/mL lower than normal (Range 7-31)Vitamin B12: 365 pg/mL (range 213-816)Iron Binding Capacity Unsaturated: 354 mcg/dL higher than norm. (range 112-347)Iron Binding Capacity Total: 442 mcg/dL higher than norm. (range 250-400)(this blood test was done on day 12 after getting my shot; I was due for my next shot 2 days later. Usually by the 2-week mark my B12 result is 300 or lower)My provider wants me to see an hematologist. I am interested to find out if they can determine the cause of these results (I do eat meat and dairy and fairly healthily in general), but not sure what an hematologist can do? Intrinsic factor was tested last year and it didn't show PA. My provider suggested getting an endoscopy and colonoscopy to determine if there's something to do with my digestion and not absorbing vitamins well, but then she said let's leave it to the hematologist to order that testing if needed. Should I push back and request those tests anyway?"
B12 Deficiency,MMA test,"I've had low B12 diagnosed since early 2016. I was on monthly shots then every 3 weeks then every 2 weeks for the last 1.5 years. They recently did B12 blood testing after 1 week (level was 521 which is fine) then after 2 weeks (level was 281 which is low) so that confirmed that I still need the shots every 2 weeks. They did an IF factor test a few months ago and that was ""normal"" (can't remember the result but it indicated that that test was not pointing to pernicious anemia, despite the fact that I sometimes also have low iron. I eat meat/dairy and have not had gastric bypass surgery so they (thankfully) are trying to find out what is going on. The most recent test was for MMA (Methylmalonate) and the result was 56 out of an acceptable range of 0-378. My doctor says that is within normal limits - it looks to me like it's on the low end but I don't know anything about that test, whether the low end is really still fine, or if it's like B12 where actually the low end (e.g. 300 on a B12 test) should actually be considered out of the acceptable range? Has anyone else scored ""normal"" on all the other B12/PA related testing but still have unexplainable low blood B12? The next step might be a gastro scope to see if there's something wrong with my digestion - I discovered a gluten sensitivity about a year before they discovered my B12 was low so wondering if there could be a connection there, but don't want to undergo a scope if there are other explanations?"
B12 Deficiency,Stopping of B12,hellomy mum has had pernicious anemia for approximatley 50 years and has been on B12 for most of this. Her gp has now told her that her B12 is normal and they are now stopping her injections after all this time though she has lots of medical problems. has anybody come across this before and is this normal for a gp to do? My mum is still very tired and fatigued. thank you.
B12 Deficiency,Extremely low B12 levels - is this normal?,"Hello. I suspected that I had anemia because sometimes I would get dizzy when I stood up from the couch. And went to a doctor. He ordered a blood test. We got the results and he said ""You don't have anemia but you have vitamin D and B12 deficiency, which also can cause that dizziness."" And he prescribed some supplements. But I'm concerned with my test results because my B12 results are shown in pg/ml.My B12 level = 95 pg/ml (which is 0.095 nanograms)Healthy or reccomended minimum B12 level = 150.000 (150 thousand) pg/ml (which is 150 nanograms)So... This is very confusing and frightening to me. I don't even have 1 nanograms of B12 and the minimum healthy ammount is 150. I have to have like 1500 times more than this in order to be ""minimum healthy""Can these results be mistaken? I mean I don't really have a healthy diet but I didn't expect this much of deficiency. (I'm not a vegan but I usually eat junk food, at least I used to)I mean, looking at these test results... I feel like I should have died from this, right? But anyway, you know better so if you could explain this to me, I would really appreciate it. By the way, while the reccomended amount of B12 intake daily is around 3-5 micrograms, my supplement has 1 miligrams of B12 in it (which I take daily) and it's 1000 micrograms. Is this safe? I'm taking 250 times more than I should. And the doctor said that I should take these for at least 3 months."
B12 Deficiency,Help! Blood Results MCV 104.4 and B12 level 261 - is this B12 level normal?,"Hi everyoneI have been suffering with balance problems, vertigo, fatigue, itching skin and scalp, dry skin patches, and vision sensitivity and hearing dullness - plus dreadful headaches and forgetfulness. I have had a clear MRI and also consulted a neurologist who said that my B12 level of 261 is normal. From reading on-line I am wondering if I could have a B12 deficiency? People are saying you need a level of 500 to operate well.Does this result really indicate a good B12 level? What are the implications of the MCV of 104.4?I would be so grateful for any insights!In advance a big thanksMel x"
B12 Deficiency,Vitamin B12 NICE Guideline Help!,"Can anyone help me with regards to the NICE guidelines in relation to Vitamin B12?I've been experiencing some neurological symptoms over the last week. Started off with tingling in my hands which travelled to my arms. went to A&E the doctor did no bloods and said it was a migraine. Fast forward to three days later, the tingling also went to my feet, legs and bum. Went to A&E again told the doctor who this time took my bloods. By this time i had looked it up on the internet and it was pointing to either B12 deficiency or MS. At this point I am worried sick about MS. The doctor in A&E said my bloods were fine but he didnt do a B12 blood test because they dont do that in A&E! He wants me to go for a scan to rule out MS. When I got home I dug out my blood results from September and my Serum B12 was 281ng/L. Which ive now read is low but within range at my GP surgery.Ive read somewhere that if I have neurological symptoms and my level is that low that within the NICE guidelines they have to treat me with B12 injections. Can anyone shed any light (sorry for the long post)"
B12 Deficiency,Nerve pain after routine B12 injection,"Hey guys, I wanted to pick your brains. I had a normal 12 week B12 injection, which are always unpleasant but this time was different. It was much more painful than usual, but of course I look the other way when it's being done. Since then I've developed worsening pain up through my shoulder into the neck down to my fingers. I can not get my arm comfortable, cold makes it more painful and it's almost like a migraine/toothache kind of pain running down my arm. I've since been back to see my GP who has given me a course of antibiotics as he's treating it as an infection first and then take it from there. Antibiotics are not doing anything with it. Just wondered if there's been anyone in a similar situation. Thanks for taking the time to read ?"
B12 Deficiency,B12 Deficiency and Body injuries,"Does anyone has experience with an injury taking longer to heal, like a strained muscle, or a pinched nerve? Can the deficiency make it harder for the body to heal or even get injured more easily?I recently hurt my lower back and I was in very intense pain for a few days, couldn't get out of bed.And once I thought I felt better, started my normal activities and hurt myself again cleaning.I'd like to hear others experiences."

B12 Deficiency,High MCV After 6 Yrs Of Treatment?,"Hello, I hope everyone's as well as possible.I was wondering whether anyone could help with a quick question at all..? I’m 30 and I’ve been treated with B12 injections every 3 months for the past 5-6years for Pernicious Anaemia. My MCV is still high (averaging 105). My doctor and rheumatologist were both clueless as to why it’s still like this on treatment. I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts; how long would these levels ordinarily take to drop back within normal range?If you’re able to help at all that would be very much appreciated as I’ve nobody else to ask as the specialists don’t seem to know either.Thank you so much! ?Caz"

B12 Deficiency,B12 Deficiency Symptoms - is this possible with 'normal' levels?,"Hi guys, I'm just curious - is it possible to still have a B12 deficiency/many of the symptoms that go along with this, but still have what is considered a normal Active B12 level?I had a whole raft of blood tests done for B12 deficiency and an autoimmune disorder but all came back as normal. Many were near the lower end but still, fairly normal. I'm seeing a private GP, as my own one has been nearly useless and he is adamant that my symptoms show the above and is keen to treat with B12 injections, folate and vit D despite the results being relatively normal.Is this possible?"

B12 Deficiency,Lumbosacrel Plexopathy ,"Almost 3 years ago I got up out of a chair and experienced horrific pain in my knee, groin and back within 30 seconds I was paralysed in the left leg. I spent 1 week in hospital with a diagnoses of GBSyndrome. I was wrongly diagnosed and after many more tests a Neurologist diagnosed Lumbosacrel Plexopathy. My left knee is permanently numb, which has really hindered my day to day activities. Fortunately I am no longer paralysed in my leg, but the numbness is extremely uncomfortable as it is constantly there. I have had many months of Hydro and Physio but to no avail. My question is will the nerves in my left knee ever rejuvenate, or will this be as good as it gets. I have never had Chemo nor Have I got Diabetes. I do not know how and why this rare Peripheral Nerve disease has happened."

B12 Deficiency,Can b12 deficiency cause a chronic itch? ,I’ve been back and forth from doctors over year trying to diagnose my itchy scalp which is a constant thing and like torture. I find it hard to enjoy life with this problem and am desperate to find out what’s causing it.After a dermatological cause being ruled out by 2 doctors and 2 trichologists I have been looking online for answers. After blood tests in October 2017 it revealed I had a very low b12 level and was put on injections monthly which have now changed to every 3 months. After 2 months of injections my itch went away however after my 6th one the itch came back and blood tests showed my b12 was normal. Has my late diagnosis of b12 deficiency (an absorption issue) causes nerve damage that is just isolated to my scalp? I’ve read about scalp neuritis online but not b12 as a cause. I am desperate for answers and what medication will numb this itch so I can start living my life again. 
B12 Deficiency,"B12 at 126 - doctor recommended capsules, but am wanting to go ahead with shots","I recently had my blood work done to find out my B12 levels were VERY low at 126 mcg.

I am pushing to get everything back to normal so i can start to feel normal again!On top of this, are there any other vitamins that others take to help absorption.Thank you all in advance!"
B12 Deficiency,Is this Vitamin B12 Deficiency?,"It all started 9 months ago when suddenly I started having discomfort in my arms and chest and a tightness in my throat thats persisted til now. (Two months before that I found out I had acid reflux & a throat infection for the 1st time, got antacids medicines etc. and it went away in a few wks) I heard that can deplete your b12, as well as stress and also my diet was somewhat poor before that too. I was fine for a whole month then it happened.After that, i started getting random symptoms every few weeks/months that generally lasted a few weeks then disappeared such as -teeth sensitivity-numbness on either sides of my body or face-tongue feels dry/uncomfortable(but not smooth)-sometimes chest upwards heats up-tinnitus (still have)-left eye twitching (still have)So to sum it up i have tinnitus, eye twitching, a slight dry feeling or something tongue i can't describe it but it's uncomfortable, chest and arm achey discomfort. Sometimes i have random palpitations especially when im laying/resting these symptoms feel worse or when i drink coffee, and sometimes I just feel weak and sick. I've had b12, vit d bloodtests and more and they all came back ""normal"". I forgot the # but will pick up paperwork and find out again soon. Is there any way these symptoms are related to b12 deficiency although my test came back normal? Or is it unrelated, does it seem like another cause?Any insight would be greatly appreciated thanks lots!"

B12 Deficiency,Unsure as to what is causing vitamin B12 deficiency in my daughter?,"About 18 months ago, my teenage daughter (now 16) suddenly became tired constantly. She had no energy, was sleeping much more and was generally down and unwell. On top of this she had crops of mouth ulcers that would appear about 10 at a time, she was going through a rough stage. The doctors were puzzled but ran blood tests and the outcome; very low levels of vitamin b12. My daughter is not a vegan and eats healthily, a diet fortified with vitamin b12 food groups. She had a level of about 80 pg/mL. This meant nothing to me, I was aware it was low, but I was unsure how low. She was started on vitamin b12 oral supplements and no repeat blood tests were scheduled. I assumed the vitamins were working and would quickly fix the problem. They didn't, and ever since then she has had to endure very painful mouth ulcers among other symptoms. The doctor repeated bloods 3 months later and the results came back the same, around 80 pg/mL however tests for pernicious anaemia came back negative. Folate levels were all normal. He suggested to stay on the tablets and eat a diet with more vitamin b12 and see whether this would improve it. We followed this and it was still to no avail, we assumed it was something she'd just have to manage. 3 weeks ago is when I noticed she had gone very downhill, she was very pale, lethargic and just generally looked unwell. She had huge, very painful mouth ulcers and was hardly eating, she had ulcers right next to her tonsils. The doctor ran urgent blood tests and the b12 came back very low at 59 pg/mL. He agreed that this was extremely low and also ran tests for ceiliac disease and ferritin. Both were normal. He's established that her body isn't absorbing b12 but he wants to find an underlying cause for it, she seems to be a mystery. Chrone's was suggested as she was admitted to hospital for very painful stomach cramps and problems with bowel movements earlier in the year. I just want to see it sorted for her, she has important exams ahead and I hate seeing her so run down as she's otherwise a healthy teenager. Any advice or suggestions would be much appreciated."

I am unsure as to how long I have all these illnesses before being diagnosed but I have also realised I have started to walk oddly. Walking as easy as it should be really isn't. My legs feel like lead weights and I find myself over compensating which causes very painful pulling down the inner and outside of my lower legs.

I have had a booster course of vitamin D tablets which were 20000 units and I'm currently a daily tablet of 1000 units. I have also had my 6 booster b12 injections and I'm awaiting my next injection (due in 4 weeks). I am at the point of extreme exhaustion again. Simple house duties make me feel like I've done a major workout... and walking my children to school makes me feel like I've ran a marathon. I have gained a fair bit of weight recently which is making me feel very depressed and angry with myself but I just don't have the energy to exercise. I am unsure as to how long I have all these illnesses before being diagnosed but I have also realised I have started to walk oddly. Walking as easy as it should be really isn't. My legs feel like lead weights and I find myself over compensating which causes very painful pulling down the inner and outside of my lower legs. On top of weight gain and knowing I'm walking oddly has made me very anxious. This doesn't help On top of being short of breathe very quickly from a very simple task, which quickly turns into a anxiety attack... I started sweating alot and feel like everyone is staring at me.I feel trapped, I'm failing as a young parent as I can't do much with kids before I'm in alot of pain and exhausted. I'm slipping on household duties... I'm so depressed but feel like nobody around me understands. I wish I felt energetic again as this would solve alot of my problems. Anybody else feel like this and have been able to resolve it?"
B12 Deficiency,B12 overdose symptoms ,"Hi, I started taking 5,000mcg thinking extra b12 would be harmless about 3 weeks ago everyother day. Apparently not, my arms and legs went numb and tingly first I went to the doc. Never said anything about b12 gave me methylprednisolone and meloxicam. I had continued taking the b12 I assumed it was a ""healthy"" thing. Went back in for a check up and the NP tested my b12 my level was 3 times the normal amount at 1853. She thinks everything is coming from the b12. I now have slight tingling in arms, side of face, muscle weakness, cramping tummy, and joint pain. Does anyone have similar issues and how long until I get the b12 out of my system, coffee and water is going strong. It's been 5 days since my last b12 tablet.

B12 Deficiency,Could it be b12 deficiency?,"I'm gonna post my symptoms and story here. I'm 17 years old and this has been taking over my life so I would appreciate any help.It started with numbness and tingling in my left hand, then moved to my right hand and then my feet. I also had episodes where suddenly I would become really tired at night and out of breath, heart palpitations, etc.... and after an x-ray of my lungs doctor found I have something in my left lung and been prescribed an inhaler (which didn't help that much). The tingling spread to every part of my body, I feel it in my back, my neck, my head, my face, my shoulder is tingling now as I write this. I only keep having this sensation of something crawling on my skin. One doctor gave me 1000 mcg mecobalamin tablets 2 times a day for 10 days and it really improved the numbness and tingling, I almost don't have it these days which is why I suspect a b12 deficiency. I'm gonna post all my symptoms below•numbness and tingling and crawling sensation•heart palpitations•feeling tired all the time•ringing in ear when lying down•vision changes (increase in floaters, also seeing flashing stars in my vision, retina is fine)•breathlessness•headaches (I always feel like my head is heavy and get random pain at random parts of my head, also feel pressure in my ears)•been kind of depressed and anxious recently•jaw ache•burning in my arms and legs, even my head•I also had loss of appetite before (which improved with the mecobalamin tablets)The most frustrating part is that everything turns out normal and doctors don't believe me. Thyroid tests were normal also. I keep pushing them to test for vitamins but they tell me it's not needed and it's all because of stress. I also suspect I had a sinus infection but I never got it cleared up with a doctor, so could some of my symptoms be from that?Please if you have any knowledge about this or any similar symptoms let me know.

B12 Deficiency,"Low B12 folate, feratin, vitamin D ","Hi I’m new here and I’ve been diagnosed with B12 below 150, folate 6 feratin 47, I’m also on Vitamin D supplements (10month course) I saw my doctor 4 weeks ago because I was feeling low and tired I thought I had empty nest as my eldest has been at uni for 3 years now (due home soon) after blood results came back I was put on the VD supplements, I also have adult kidney disease, it’s my kidney consultant thats picked up on the above blood results and written to my doctor to screen for pernicious Anaemia/celiac disease. I cut lactose out of my diet 5 years ago as I couldn’t digest it and gluten gives me a very noisy stomach, but I also have mild vitiligo, I have an appointment next Tuesday to see my doctor So hopefully i’ll get some answers and treatment to get me back to feeling myself again, my kidney doctor noted that my red blood count is in the normal range. Any views. advice very much appreciated. "
B12 Deficiency,Pernicious Anaemia or Dietary? ,"Hi everyone, basically I've had neurological issues, dizziness, stomach pain etc etc (nearly all the symptoms for b12 deficiency) for a couple years now. I had blood tests done and was told I had a b12 deficiency and Vitimin D deficiency in late 2016/early 2017 and had 5 booster shots in a week. I felt a lot better after a couple months but then started going downhill again a while later and went back for more blood tests. They said my b12 was fine and I ended up not going to the doctors until last week when my symptoms were getting so bad (extremely bad dizziness and nerve tingling in my neck, arms, legs, head etc). Had another blood test and they said my B12 was low again and I'm now having injections every 3 months, This made me think that it is probably due to pernicious anaemia since its only been about a year since I had my previous injections. However, the nurse who gave me my shot today went back in my notes all the way to 2014 when apparently I had a blood test done and my b12 levels were on the borderline of being low and said how they've just been declining as the years have gone on apart from when they were fine for those few months, She then proceeded to say (as the doctor I had a year ago did) that it is probably due to my diet since I am a vegetarian and don't have a lot of dairy in my diet. Which I could see why since its a high source of b12 but I wasn't even a veggie in 2014 and ate quite a lot of meat, but my levels were already nearing the low side. If it was my diet still surely my levels wouldn't have dropped so fast after having the initial booster shots as well? Since my Doctor now has said I need to have injections every 3 months (this was only relayed to me over the phone by the receptionist so I could book a day for my injection) which is typically done for people with pernicious anaemia (Which there is also a family history for), does that mean I have pernicious anaemia or it is my diet? I'm planning on making another appointment with my Doctor to discuss this more but in the time being I'm worrying that it is due to my diet and I've brought these horrible symptoms on myself.

B12 Deficiency,Can B12 level of 286 cause neurological symptoms?,"Hello everyone, can someone advise if my B12 level of 286 can cause neurological issues? My problems started just after New Year with numbness in my chin, left side only. After a few weeks, I had a full blood count taken, my folate result was 1.6 so I'm now on folic acid 5mg daily and my B12 was 286, the guidelines I was told are between 200 and 700 so my Doctor has advised my B12 is ""acceptable"" and I'm on no treatment for B12.However, my symptoms are getting progressively worse - I get periodic burning sensation/pins and needles in my face, scalp, shoulder blades, arms, hands, legs and feet, along with pressure in the back of my head. By 5 pm most days I feel like I'm 'sparking' (feels like small electrics shocks)... Doc thought it would be Atypical neuralgia because of my face so has referred me to see a Neurologist, however couldn't explain why I'm getting it nearly all over the body...I'm getting pretty anxious now about what the cause can be and I can't help thinking that my B12 level is involved somehow? I have two cousins that have to inject B12 regularly and an Aunt with Pernicious Anaemia (different sides of the family).I would love to know everyone's thoughts on this and if I could try taking Methyl B12 to help potential nerve damage as I'm worried the nerve damage will continue to get worse.Thanks everyone x "
B12 Deficiency,Feeling really drained between b12 & depression,"I got diagnosed nearly one year ago ! In this year I have never felt any more useless in my life.

I feel I'm being so lazy but I honestly cant say when the last time I felt ""normal"" I cry everyday more than once. The childcare couldn't be any more stressful as I can't find alternative childcare for when chikdminders on hoilday. I have handed in my notice at work I just can't do it all.

B12 Deficiency,Anxiety? Deficiency? Something else?,"I really need help. To sum it up, coming off the roughest year of my life (death, pregnancy out of nowhere, etc), drunk every night for a little over a year along with skoal half my life. Quit everything cold turkey a few months ago. Now ever since I've had extremely weak spells, shaking, heart racing, BP through the roof, thought I was dying. Lasted anywhere from 20 minutes to off and on all day. Been to 3 Drs. First gave depression pills. Didn't take. 2nd gave water pill for BP and buspirone for anxiety. Took the water pill only. Helped very slightly. Switched to lycinipril. BP was better but still spells. Went to 2nd Dr again. Found b12 was 190. Been on b12 shots weekly. First helped. After not so much. Seen 3rd Dr. Found low vitamin D. Been on 1 pill weekly. No difference. Started the buspirone and it's helped very much. But now it's kind of like clockwork. After I've been awake for 5-7 hours I get spells. Morning I'm fine and nighttime I'm fine. Not 100% but fine. The buspirone has helped but it's still happening. Sometimes bad sometimes not. Pins and needles in arms and legs, weakness, heart races and sweats usually. If I eat, if not, if I sleep well, if not, if I work, if I lay in bed this happens like clockwork. Trying b12, magnesium, and the D pill and today I started folic acid. Just trying to find help. I've missed a lot of work and went home because I just can't function. I go from feeling absolutely wonderful and full of energy to nothing in seconds. My sugar has been normal during 2 spells at the Dr so I don't think it's that. Ive read all about vitamin deficiency and anxiety going hand and hand. It seems to be getting better and a lot of symptoms are going away. If it is anxiety, I don't worry or dwell on bad things or anything, it just hits out of nowhere. Or is it mostly the deficiency and do I need to do more to correct it? I've read shots weekly really don't work for some. Sorry for rambling just try to be thorough and so tired of this. I really need help.

B12 Deficiency,B-!2 deficiency sounds like the correct cause for that pain,I have been unable to get my B-12 injection prescription paid for by Aetna since last October 2017.

B12 Deficiency,Feel like I'm over the worst of the deficiency symptoms but my hair is still falling out......,"Hi All,I discovered my red blood cells were enlarged about 8 months ago, long story short I live outside the UK and it was very expensive to look into getting the frequent injections I needed so I took matters into my own hands, bought online, self injected and started to feel much much better within a few months (after some initial up and downs but now I'm way way better). However I've lost over half the volume of my hair, and it's still falling out I'm very conscious of it, I'm 39 and was thrown into peri menopause by this all as my periods just stopped (doc says lack of estrogen made my hair fall out) however I no longer think this is the case, as I am healing my cycle is starting to return, but not my hair, does anyone else have this and what can I do to help it?I'm getting a bit desperate, I've tried Saw Palmetto, and I eat quite a healthy diet, I've also started to try and exercise more often, I take zinc and folate.I want my hair back TIA"
B12 Deficiency,Ongoing Symptoms - Looking for Thoughts From Others. ,"Hi everyone!I am a 23 year old female who began experiencing some challenging symptoms in August of 2017, and after looking through many of the posts on this site in an attempt to put some of the pieces together, I figured it could not hurt to go ahead and write my own post to see of any of you all have any thoughts about what might be going on. In the summer of 2017, I remember thinking that for the past year or so I had had an increasing number of ""episodes"" during which I felt a little out of it, and while it was unusual enough that I can recall stopping to think about it, it was not anything that had a significant impact. In August of 2017, I began experiencing what I thought were probably symptoms of a urinary tract infection. On and off for a few weeks I would feel a very strong urge to go, but would get to the restroom and realize I really didn't have to go at all. I also had slightly cloudy urine, urine with an usual odor, and an increase in vaginal discharge, Additionally, I was experiencing the out of it feeling more frequently during this time, but thought ""Oh maybe I have a UTI and it is making me feel a little funky."" I went to urgent care and both the dip stick test and the follow up culture came back negative, so I figured it was something that would just pass, and sure enough about a week later the symptoms stopped for good and I have not noticed them since.During the last week of the urinary symptoms, I was at dinner with friends when I began to feel really strange. Almost like I had been drinking, like I was on another planet, almost like my vision was not quite right but I couldn't even pin point why. I figured I must have been really tired from my first job out of college and driving a few hours to see my friends, so I went to bed thinking it was temporary. I felt better the next day, but continued to feel out of it at times to the point where I was beginning to wonder if there was something more significant than fatigue at play, but I still didn't take any action.Things took a turn a couple of weeks later in mid-September. I had an unsettling onset of symptoms - long-lasting headaches, blurry vision that felt almost tunnelish, visually felt like there was a thick layer between me and my surroundings, felt uncoordinated like I was moving through jello, heart palpitations, noticed strange sensations in right foot, leg, and arm, lack of appetite, mild nausea, and fatigue - just completely like I was in a fun house. Other than the headaches which I probably got every few days, these symptoms were not on and off, but constant. My primary care physician, who I see maybe once a year, could tell that something was really off and ordered a round of basic labs - CBC, thyroid, metabolic panel, etc. that all came back normal. When the symptoms were getting worse instead of better heading into October, and there was still no ""answer,"" she decided to go ahead and order an MRI of my brain since I have never had a similar issue or any sort of issue. The MRI came back perfectly normal except for some minor white matter changes, which took us down a road of ""Could it be MS?"" for some time due to the neurological nature of some of what I was experiencing. Had a local neurology consult, a lumbar puncture, a second MRI in December, and even a visit to the Mayo Clinic in January that all confirmed absolutely no MS. EVERYTHING was tested for back in October - lyme disease, other tick-born illness, Myasthenia Gravis, more detailed thyroid testing, heavy metal toxicity, Vitamin D, B12,c-reactive protein - and even MORE was tested for when I had a lumbar puncture when MS was on the table - they did it all and I am incredibly thankful. The only abnormal results that have come back throughout the entire course have been B12 in 300s (neurologist originally wondered if this could be a contributing factor and prescribed a course of injections), dropping white blood count (down from 8 to 4 from September to November and now back up to 6), low carnatine and acetyl carnatine, and slightly elevated copper.Since the height of the symptoms in October, things seem to be gradually improving, or at least changing in nature. For a while, I was not functional - took three weeks off work, stayed in bed all the time, could not even watch movies due to discomfort with symptoms. Only thing that seemed to slightly help was if I took Sumatriptan for a bad headache, the headache would go away, then half a day or so later some of the head/eye issues would feel a bit less severe, but still definitely there. By the end of November, I was not having headaches, my vision returned to normal, I just felt like there was physically a layer between me and the world all the time due to this ""feeling"" in my head/eyes/behind eyes and had the sensations on my right side. Now, I still don't have headaches or blurry vision, the ""layer"" has decreased, the sensations are mainly in my lower calf and foot, I have an appetite, I don't have nausea, and I am definitely less tired, BUT I have this feeling in my head (almost like there is ""something"" between my brain and my scalp) and also in my eyes (like there is a coating of wax (especially in the back) around them even though I can see perfectly.) It is not painful at all, it is not pressure, it is absolutely nothing like a headache - just like an unsettling sensation with slight movement but not dizziness or vertigo or anything like that, and it is not episodic, but constant - there 24/7. Between the beginning and the present, there have definitely been ""phases"" - had pain behind right eye for a few weeks in November, had stronger sensations in right leg on days after B12 injections, felt like the ""nerve strings from my eyes into my head had been scorched"" even though that makes NO medical sense, just some random things like that that were difficult to put into the ""big picture"" of whatever we might be looking at. The only ""action"" that has been taken between the onset and now has been the B12 injections in October and November, prednisone taper for six weeks from beginning of November through December (neurologist thought inflammation could be a factor and DEFINITELY noticed an improvement on steroids, though steroids improve so many things it's hard to say what was going on there), and multivitamin now. I am of a healthy weight, I ran five days a week before this came on and still run when I feel up to it, and I have an insignificant medical history other than a typical case of mono in the spring of 2016. I take birth control and a probiotic both daily (and have taken both for almost five years), but do not take/have not taken any other medication other than what is listed above.I apologize that this has been so lengthy and so all over the place. Just wanted to include as much as I could since there have been a lot of little pieces. My mind has been everywhere from MS to vitamin deficiencies to vasculitis. My parents are physicians, and have been incredibly helpful, but there is just no ""answer"" which makes the process a challenging one. To take a common line from these boards, I am just feeling like I want my life back. Hope right now from all involved is that it is something viral, or at least something that will fade completely, but just wanted to see if you all might have any insight!Thanks so much in advance!"

Only thing that seemed to slightly help was if I took Sumatriptan for a bad headache, the headache would go away, then half a day or so later some of the head/eye issues would feel a bit less severe, but still definitely there. By the end of November, I was not having headaches, my vision returned to normal, I just felt like there was physically a layer between me and the world all the time due to this ""feeling"" in my head/eyes/behind eyes and had the sensations on my right side. Now, I still don't have headaches or blurry vision, the ""layer"" has decreased, the sensations are mainly in my lower calf and foot, I have an appetite, I don't have nausea, and I am definitely less tired, BUT I have this feeling in my head (almost like there is ""something"" between my brain and my scalp) and also in my eyes (like there is a coating of wax (especially in the back) around them even though I can see perfectly.) It is not painful at all, it is not pressure, it is absolutely nothing like a headache - just like an unsettling sensation with slight movement but not dizziness or vertigo or anything like that, and it is not episodic, but constant - there 24/7. It feels unsettling and almost claustrophobic and just ALWAYS there. Between the beginning and the present, there have definitely been ""phases"" - had pain behind right eye for a few weeks in November, had stronger sensations in right leg on days after B12 injections, felt like the ""nerve strings from my eyes into my head had been scorched"" even though that makes NO medical sense, just some random things like that that were difficult to put into the ""big picture"" of whatever we might be looking at. The only ""action"" that has been taken between the onset and now has been the B12 injections in October and November, prednisone taper for six weeks from beginning of November through December (neurologist thought inflammation could be a factor and DEFINITELY noticed an improvement on steroids, though steroids improve so many things it's hard to say what was going on there), and a multivitamin (Smarty Pants for Women) and sublingual B12 daily now. Wondering what all of these things may be in factor in improvement or current symptoms?I am of a healthy weight, I ran five days a week before this came on and still run when I feel up to it, and I have an insignificant medical history other than a typical case of mono in the spring of 2016. I take birth control and a probiotic both daily (and have taken both for almost five years), but do not take/have not taken any other medication other than what is listed above.I apologize that this has been so lengthy and so all over the place. Just wanted to include as much as I could since there have been a lot of little pieces. My mind has been everywhere from MS to vitamin deficiencies to vasculitis. My parents are physicians, and have been incredibly helpful, but there is just no ""answer"" which makes the process a challenging one. To take a common line from these boards, I am just feeling like I want my life back. Hope right now from all involved is that it is something viral, or at least something that will fade completely, but just wanted to see if you all might have any insight!Thanks so much in advance!"

B12 Deficiency,Is Chlorella a good source of Vitamin B12? ,"I’ve been vegan for 3.5 years and have pretty much avoided B12 supplementation. Nutritional yeast and chlorella are pretty much my only two sources. I had bloodwork done recently and my total Serum Vitamin B12 levels were 294 ng/l.

B12 Deficiency,Exhaustion prior to next B12 injection,I've been on Cytamen (four weekly) B12 injections for 38 years due to PA following partial gastrectomy in 1959.In the days running up to my next injection I sometimes feel quite exhausted and to combat this scheduled a few 3 week injections - perhaps twice/three times a year. However my nurse is now refusing to allow me to do this. Am I the only person to experience this feeling of exhaustion prior to an injection??

I've read that it's okay to do some light exercise if you can and it could even help a bit (for blood to circulate) and others tell me that I should stay put and rest a lot.

B12 Deficiency,Vit B12 deficiency and Beclomethasone/Mometasone Furoate,"I posted some weeks back about my symptoms making my life a misery and B12 testing that came back at 400+ and therefore deemed ok, despite a very high MCH. Further tests were done to rule out other causes, all came back fine thankfully.In the meantime, in desperation, and thanks to a link I found here, I ordered some injectable B12 and starting following the guidance, injecting myself every other day. The first two made my symptoms worse, then I got slightly better, and for the first time in over 18 months, I felt almost like my old self 2 days after the 6th injection. This was short lasting though as 4 days after my last injection, the symptoms that had miraculously disappeared returned with a vengeance. I have therefore decided to inject again to see if a pattern will confirm the deficiency (to me if not my GP!).Doing further research though, I cam across a site listing the above drugs as known to deplete B12. This was a complete shock as I have now been prescribed Mometasone for 3 years for my dust mite allergy (the only thing that controls it) which I switched to Beclomethasone (Beconase hayfever) as available over the counter. I use the spray about 3 to 4 times a week now. It was therefore quite a surprise to see the link between the two.Does anyone know about this? "

B12 Deficiency,Help Me!!! ,"Hi...I'm a 37 year old women who has felt like she has been hit by a bus for the last couple of years!! I Initially likened how I was felling to having an infection or virus hanging over me all the time but after Various Dr's appointments, hospital referrals and blood tests nothing bar a few recurring urine infections and low iron has ever been found...Due to how long this has been going on it's caused me to become very anxious and depressed and I must have diagnosed myself 20 times over!! The GP's have tried various times to put me on anti anxiety meds and I think they would like to pop me under the anxiety induced symptoms umbrella which has made me stop going to the docs and as I don't think they are taking me seriously...Since having my daughters I have always suffered from low iron/ferritin levels but the last time I had them checked (about 6 months ago) I was very plainly told that at the level they were at would not be causing the symptoms I was having. (prescribed 320g of ferrous furrate twice a day, iron level at 11) Again I felt really unsupported and haven't been back since..I am now back to the drawing books as feeling particularly lousy and starting to wonder (after doing a bit of reading on how rubbish GP's seem to be with Anaemia) if Pernicious Anaemia and B12 is something that should be checked!!I have all my classic low iron symptoms, breathesness, extreme tiredness, insomnia, white eyes but wondered if anyone else with the above can relate to my slightly weirder symptoms and reassure me I'm not going crazy.Dizziness...this is a weird one as always used to get in the same place, the school gate, my 3rd daughters bedroom, folding the washing!! Wasn't until recently I have connected it with really bright colours and patterns, it's like my brain goes into overload with looking at a busy/bright scene.Weird mouth sensations...mostly always brought on by wrigleys airways chewing gum, mouth goes completely numb, leading onto feelings off extreme dizziness, nausea and just oddnessThumb on left hand feels lazy, when I reach for something, it's like it's not connected with what my brain is asking it do and takes a few seconds to catch up.Small twitches above on the top of my lip, eyebrow, and ocassionally eye, doesn't feel very serious, and it goes as quickly as it comes but still there!!Underarm, breast bone and rib cake sensations no lumps or even enlarged lymph node just a feeling, sometimes feels muscular and other times feels almost topical like a mild scratch or burn.Random onsets in my Jaw, neck and shoulders where I feel like I have had 6 rounds with Mike Tyson (actually reminds of the days after giving birth when your hole core aches from the pressure and tensing...Joint pain in my fingers and toes. Frequent urination, feels like uti symptoms (possibly is but I'm avoiding the unsympathetic Doc!!) And probably the worse...all consuming anxiety with I'm sure magnifys a few of the above but mostly just paralyses my ability to do anything about them other than scrutinise and worry...because well what's the point, nobody listens!!

B12 Deficiency,24 years old- just been diagnosed with PA,"HeyThis week I was diagnosed with Pernicious Anemia caused by antibodies against intrinsic factor. I've known that I've been low in B12 for at least a year when my results came back as 187ng but I didn't know what this meant. I kind of ignored it and then had some bloods done in ocotober where my B12 levels had gone down to 167ng. Did tests and found out about PA.In this past year and a half/2 years I've had all sorts of problems from mental health, sleep problems to stomach problems, being diagnosed with GORD. I've also had this strange feeling in my head and top of my neck like vibrating and sometimes a electrical sound coming from the base of the head. Last week I started having symptoms in my right leg, muscular cramps, pains and weaknesses. After looking at the symptoms of PA and other complications of it, I am concerned that I've had this for a period of time and it is this that's causing it. problem is, my doctor didn't seem to know much and just printed off something from google and said that after 6 months of B12 injections, we will see if my symptoms persist.is it normal that I'm being like this? Am I being paranoid?Also do we know prognosis even after having B12 injections. Another doctor asked if I have thyroid/arthritis problems in the family and most immediate family members do. Should I be worried about this?Thanks in advance!Meg "

B12 Deficiency,Severe B12 deficiency - Guidance,"It's the 2nd time i fell into severe b12 anemia, I've had most of the symptoms, pins and needles, cramps, digestive problems, depression, panic attacks, exhaustion, mental fog, metallic taste, dry mouth and troat and so forth, absolutely horrible, reached a point where I couldn't get out of bed.Went to the doctor, explained her i already had b12 def.before (she even measured my blood pressure which was low), told her i was sleeping very badly and feeling tired. She reluctantly prescribed blood tests: b12 and folic acid.B12 came in very high levels, folic acid very low, red blood cells were below normal.Went to another doctor who knows i don't eat any meat, nor drink any milk, told him about the symptoms and that i started supplementing with 1000mcg sublingual and felt a little better. He told me to stop because the symptoms i was getting was actually from overdose which was the reason why in the blood test b12 came high.Sure I'm not an idiot and didn't stop, in fact i doubled the dose, had i done what he told me i would probably be in the hospital or worse.It's been 6months since i started supplementing with b12 and only 2 since i started taking 5000mcg. I did a lot of research on the subject and learned one can't overdose it.Now my question are: I'm getting better, very slowly, but is it normal to be taking so long? Also still feel very tired in certain times of the month (being a young female).Can i still take this dose or is too high or too low? I haven't done any more blood tests lately, it seems pointless cause they don't tell how my active levels really are.I appreciate any guidance since I can't go anywhere else. Thank you.

B12 Deficiency,B12 injections,"I just started my B12 injections (I’ve had 5 out of 6 loading doses so far) and after the first few I started getting these awful tension type headaches that won’t go away along with nausea? I’m unsure if it’s a coincidence or if it’s the injections themselves. I’ve heard many people say that it’s not unusual for things to feel a bit worse before getting better, but I guess I’m just hoping for some reassurance. Or if this is something unusual and different for me to tackle."

B12 Deficiency,Vitamin b12 deficiency & weight gain,after a blood test last October I was diagnosed with vitamin b12 and folate deficiency. Earlier in the year I had been experiencing extreme tiredness and fatigue was upset all the time and had been diagnosed with depression. I was pleased when my doctors had identified I had a b12 deficiency as they explained that could have been the cause of my depression.I was prescribed Cyanocobalamin and was taking this up until the end of April this year. I was given a blood test just after I had stopped taking it and was told this was now in the normal range (a score of 250) and that I didn't need any further treatment.I had been feeling ok for a little while but for the last month or so I have been feeling very tired again. I have been experiencing numbness in my hands and feet and am finding it hard to concentrate at work and am experiencing regular headaches. In the 7 months I had been taking Cyanocobalamin I have gained 3 stone in weight and I can't put this down to over eating. I have been trying to lose some of this weight over the last month (whilst making sure I am still maintaining good sources of vitamin b12) and by exercising but I don't seem to be able to lose the weight. I'm not sure what to do. Can anyone provide some advice??

She is suffering, dizzy spells where her sight goes black, headaches, feeling sick, exhaustion, itchy skin, craving ice, foot pain, pins and needles, mood swings, anxiety, ulcers, palpitations, looking pale, confusion, lack of concentration. She is just not my daughter I have taken her backwards and forwards to the GP and they have said her Feritin level is 17 which they class as normal and a B12 level of 189 which they again class as normal they just keep saying to me she isn't anemic with it. I pushed and have been referred to the hospital and the consultant said wont transfuse till figures are single for iron and prob wouldn't treat a child. And B12 won't provide injections and don't believe it's that. They have done ECG and that's been it. Waiting for a tape for 24 hrs but wanting to leave her till next year before chase anything else up. She isn't functioning on a daily basis what else can I do. ? She has been prescribed some iron supplement but that's making her feel more sick and not helping any of her symptoms. I'm so worried she isn't well."
B12 Deficiency,dizziness last one year ,"Hey all !Hope everyone doing well ! It's gowtm 27_M Last year -16 October one day suddenly I felt room spinning sensation while working at noon time ,. Then I checked my blood pressure, sugar, and hemoglobin everything normal. Then after some three weeks again same problem came this time no spinning sensation but constant dizziness mostly severe at morning also felt my head is heavy. And I meet with Dr. She sent me to ENT specialist there I prescribed for inner ear infection medicines with some balance exercises but no change in my case. So I got forwarded to neurologist there he took MRI of my brain result came fine but still he prescribed some medicines but no improvement. In between myself decided and did master health check up with ECG, x-ray, ultrasound.etc all are fine. My symptoms are constant dizziness, heaviness in head, blurry vision, thirsty feeling, occasional spinning sensation, raising heart beat if I suddenly wakeup, chest and shoulder pain, deep breathing etc,. While am surfing net found my symptoms are closely related with b12 deficiency and checked my b12 which was 210 pg/ml and reference range is 180-914 even am not deficient in this range as it's in border I took 6 injections for six weeks and stopped. Then for next three months I completely felt normal then slowly symptoms started again so I put 4 injections already last month but not much improvement. So now am doubt , is b12 only the reason or something else ? Am not strict vegan and I didn't have any health issues before . Then why this? If it is due to b12 how to find root cause ? Who I have to meet next ? Or any other health issues? Should I have to continue my injection? All these questions are running over my mind and I could not concentrate on my work ! So please suggest me anyone what to do next ? Thanks! "

B12 Deficiency,Bit of a long story but any help would be appreciated,"Sorry for the long post but here goes. I've been living in France for 11 years. I the uk 2 years before this I was given a routine blood test when they were investigating IBS. My B12 was found to be really low & I was put on injections which I had been having for 2 years before coming here. My French doctor here said that in France they don't give B12 injections & that this was very old fashioned & something that he hadn't seen since being in med school many moons ago. He sent me for a blood test to see what my levels were and they came back fine which I realise now that of course they would because I had been getting injections in the uk for 2 years. Any way he said I didn't need any treatment & I though great coz I hated having injections anyway. Years go by and as I was veggie and was getting many of the symptoms on B12 def I decided to start taking a Tesco multi vitamin (one a day). Went for another blood test coz still getting symptoms and my b12 level came back at 2600. Doc told me to stop taking the multi vit, I think he thought I was taking them by the bucket load. I did a bit of searching & found out about the further tests you can have to see if you are not able to use b12 which I thought would maybe explain why my level was so high after taking just 1 multi vitamin a day & me still having symptoms. Doc didn't have a clue about these tests and said they weren't available in france as far as he knew but would refer me to a consultant at the hospital. Eventually got an appointment after they had passed me from pillar to post coz they didn't even know which type of doctor I should be seeing. The consultant was as much use as a choc fireguard and also didn't know of these tests and said as far as he knew they weren't available in France and I should just not take any more multi vitamins. He sent me for another blood test as some of the symptoms I had would indicate Sjorgrens Syndrome. This came back positive so they put the dry mouth, eyes, & loads of other things down to that but not the tiredness and feeling rundown all the time etc. He just told me to get tested for b12 every 6 months to keep a check on things which I have been doing as I'm now vegan so even more important I would think & to be honest haven't felt right for years. These tests have come back after the 2600 one showing 800 odd, 500 odd, 360, 300 & now the last one a week ago 190 which is on the low side but still within the lab range here of 179-800 so the doc is not going to do anything. I have done a bit of searching and ordered some under the tongue tablets, the Methylcobalamine ones which I've read are the ones that can be absorbed the best if you've got a problem along with the folic acid ones that I've read you need to help you absorb them. I don't know if I'm doing the right thing though with what the docs have said because if my next blood test is through the roof like it was last time after taking them they wont be very happy with me will they but there again I can't go on feeling like this as it's really effecting my life because I just feel like crap all the time. The other things on this last blood test are all low but just within the lab ranges but iron and vit d have been low a few times on the others which he's given me tablets and drops for. As I said so sorry for going on but I'm just so fed up with it all & would appreciate anything anyone can offer. Thanks so much!Sorry for the long post but here goes.

B12 Deficiency,Cyanocobalamin Side Effects,"My Serum Vitamin B12 was reported as 201 pg/ml at the end of July and the doctor started me on Cyanocobalamin 50mcg tablets two to be taken each day which I take after breakfast - no leaflet in pack saying when to take them.Since the end of August I have been having two or three loose bowel movements every morning and a feeling of intermittent wind/tickling sensation in my back passage throughout the day. I have not had any pain, bloating, bleeding or mucus and rectal and admiringly examination did not find anything only piles which I already knew about.Doctor now started me on Mebeverine for IBS to see if it helps.I suffer from health anxiety and am really worried I have bowel cancer.Has anyone else had upset bowels after starting Cyanocobalamin?REPLIES REALLY APPRECIATED.MANY THANKSDo"

B12 Deficiency,B12 ,"I was diagnosed with a b12 deficiency. I am 18, my level was just 48. I have received all off my loading dose injections, a week later I still feel very ill. I was tested for celiac disease and instrinic factor both came back negative. After my 2nd injection my b12 level came back at 2000. Really worried as to why I am feeling no improvements "
B12 Deficiency,Needing B12 shots more frequently,"I was diagnosed with low B12 almost 2 years ago when my level was 234. I took B12 shots monthly for a few months, but noticed that the tiredness, memory issues, and tingling would come back a week before the shot was due, so my doc increased to shots every 3 weeks. All this time she tested my B12 levels every month or two, and there were in the mid-300s. Once I went on the 3-weekly shots they were around 400. The last 2-3 months I've been feeling SO tired, very short-fused, emotional, and TERRIBLE memory. I requested my first blood test since May last week, and my numbers were down to 232 - right where they were when I was first diagnosed. And this blood test was just over 2 weeks after my last shot. So my doctor is increasing my shots to every 2 weeks, at least for the next month or two.Also, in May of this year I was diagnosed with Anemia, although the doctors are for some reason refusing to test for IF in order to officially diagnose Pernicious Anemia. I have missed a few iron pills here and there and my iron tested low again last week. Does B12 go lower when iron is low? Strange because my iron was fine during the first year of my B12 deficiency diagnosis. I was diagnosed with low B12 almost 2 years ago when my level was 234.

B12 Deficiency,B12,"For a few years now. Hubby has been lethargic, always yawning. Chest infections after infection treat with antibiotics. Which then gave him a rash all over his torso, approximately a week after cessation of tablets. Finally he got an asthma type symptom. Given a ventolin inhaler. Which then became a serious infection and wheeze. One thing that I as his Mrs noticed was his BREATH. For nearly 2 years he was the Listerine advert! No amount of cleaning and brushing helped! Anyway after tests and x-ray he is now diagnosed as B12 deficient. Since taking his tablets for 3 weeks. He is like a new man. 3x50mg per day no yawns, no bad breath,or wheezing. Now back running and swimming. Are these typical symptoms (breath and yawns?) It was a shock to is both, as he is a very fit man."

Until recently when I was sooooo tired, every afternoon around 2pm I get this over whelming fatigue and could easily fall asleep where I sit or stand.

Arm pain. Weight loss. Loss of appetite (although, I do force myself to eat at least 3 meals a day). Tiredness. Mood swings. Sadness (accompanies the mood swings I suppose. I simply don't feel like myself anymore). Dizziness. Joint pain. Arm pain (feel sore - all the time). Oh, and I'm 23 and recently went to the docs who told me I had a ""clean bill of health"" although I do no feel healthy at all. Could any of this be pernicious anemia? I don't believe my blood tests picked up on b12 deficiency. Gonna call my doc back soon to ask. I just want to know what's wrong with me in order to fix it. Doc said it was most likely anxiety related, but I can't ignore the obvious physical symptoms I've been feeling also. I know my body, and something is up. Help please? "

B12 Deficiency,Pernicious anaemia,"Hello all, so have suffered with constipation for many many years, I get gripes and pain often... Been really tired of late, suffer with indigestion constantly. Thoughts I had ibs, maybe I have. Anyhow recently diagnosed with vitamin b12 and folate deficiency... I recently had a colonoscopy and a healthy colon which is great. Now I am being asked to have a camera down the throat to check anything is wrong. My doc thinks maybe I am not absorbing the vitamins and folate. I had a vit b12 injection yesterday.

B12 Deficiency,Stress and B12,"I think I read somewhere that periods of high stress can reduce our B12 levels, is that right? I am on B12 shots every 3 weeks (have been doing this for about 6-9 months). I have had a very stressful couple of months and I just went through my lab results and noticed that the most recent test (a few weeks ago) was a lower result than the previous couple of months. Also, I am due for my next shot this Thursday but I have been noticing the deficiency symptoms coming on since Sunday. Do doctors prescribe extra B12 during stressful periods? I know that I am already getting shots fairly frequently. I am also on iron supplements daily. Or anything else you recommend (besides trying to reduce stress in the first place - it simply wasn't possible the last couple of months but is starting to get better now)? I imagine exercise, prayer/meditation etc but anything else?I think I read somewhere that periods of high stress can reduce our B12 levels, is that right?

B12 Deficiency,Vitb12 deficiency ?,"Hi, new to this forum. I've recently been diagnosed with a vitb12 deficiency, my level was 141 ng/l and the gp said it was slightly low?? I'm a final year student nurse and requested results and seems my b12 has been low since 2014. I was never aware of this. I have crohns disease, also have stomach ulcers and hiatus hernia and been on omperazole for 10+ years. It all started with a spell of dizziness which was diagnosed as vertigo, extreme tirdness, ringing in ears, mouth ulcers, sore tongue no matter what I ate, brain off, pins and needles. Then when I was on placement I took a spell out of nowhere which led to palpitations, this freaked me out and as a result have been suffering anxiety the past 7 weeks. Does b12 cause all these symptoms? There's more but I just can't remember at present. Thanks in advance. Hi, new to this forum.

B12 Deficiency,"I have Vitamin B-12 & Vitamin D Deficiencies, Does Anyone Else Suffer From Both? ","I am currently suffering from Vitamin B-12 and Vitamin D Deficiencies and would like to know if anyone else has the two deficiencies at the same time, and if so what symptoms are you experiencing? "
B12 Deficiency,I have B12 deficiency/Pernicious Anaemia now Dementia type symptoms,"I have suffered B12/Pernicious Anaemia for just over 10 years. For 9 months I had awfull mouth ulcers, felt so weak and tired but treated with every throat/mouth infection remedy made. Asking for a second opinion I was from there sent to Maxiofacial at the local hospital. The doctor took a quick look at my ulcers, couple of questions and immediately ordered a blood test for B12. A few days later my GP rang me in the evening to say I was to go to the surgery next morning and start injections for B12 deficiency, the Nurse would explain what it was (he did not know, nor did the Nurses), I would have them for the rest of my life. Government Guidelines being injection 12 weekly (UK gives injections a third of those in other countries) by the time 12 weeks passed I felt so incredibly ill could barely get out of bed. Having read an article in a magazine, I took this to my GP and kept on until 8 weekly. I moved 6 years ago, and using the same article and that of articles and links to the Pernicious Anaemia Society my now GP down to 6 weekly. The first week takes approx 6 days to take effect, I usually have 1 day when sudden long sleep happens. Followed by approx 3 weeks when I can manage to make the bed again, clean round the house and go out, make my appointment times. Last 2 weeks gradually feel more and more ill, so tired, my body does not want to operate. For the last 4 years I have developed Dementia type symptoms progressing to falls, forget names, addresses, cannot find the right words when filling out forms, writing letters, e mails etc. I keep a dictionary beside me to look up similar words to make sense. I have very long sleeps when I do not hear the phone, door knocking, door bell. Thus losing whole days. At Christmas I had a brain scan which showed no Dementia proper as it were. The Psychiatrist was very good and as requested looked thoroughly at PA, read the links I sent. He came to see me, although he would not see me in future as I did not have Dementia, he strongly backed my need for a Neurosurgeon and more suitable treatment for that of the type of Dementia caused by PA. This being injections every other day until such a time as my memory problems are back as they should be. I have felt so very ill between injections, days when I cannot even remember what I did earlier that day, forget so many appts., names, words. Still have falls out of the blue, send friends cards or presents to my own address, it is not until a month or so later when I find I have done these type of things. My GP has finally agreed to giving me two weeks of 3 injections per week (the loading dose when first diagnosed). An expert from the PA Society kindly had a consultation with my GP, explained more frequent injections with no ""date"" specifically to end, being dependant upon improvements. Despite this consultation all I have is this loading dose, I have bombarded my GP and Consultants for Gastro, Arthritis etc with more information, book details, links, copies of research yet still cannot get the treatment necessary. It is very clear in all the information sent that if left too late the damage to the brain is irreversible. I wonder if as the Government Guidelines are so out dated, probably not giving GP's either correct information or funding to help. GP's do not seem to have any depth of knowledge, patients are then misdiagnosed with ME, Dementias, and numerous other conditions. There is no requirement for at least one GP per surgery to have a decent knowledge of this condition, I assume that with such bad Government Guidelines that local Trusts are not funding correct treatment, GP's left without guidance or funding, especially as barely any GP has a grasp on this, have their hands tied. I would be interested to hear if anyone has had more success than myself, and if so can I borrow their GP. My GP did write to a Neurologist at our hospital, who replied that basically he wasn't interested but if my GP insisted he would see me! Even a Neurologist by the sound of it does not want to know, sounding to me as if has no proper knowledge of the condition anyway. This is such a horrible, serious illness being suffered by an increasing number of people throughout the UK. I really am worried sick that treatment, if at all, will be too late. To be constantly ill, asleep, barely able to get out of bed and forgetting /doing ridiculous things, I rarely go anywhere now, sure people don't believe this constant being poorly, my family do not feeling I have lost control of my life and trying to make excuses. I am at the lowest ebb, depressed - the stress the cause of nose bleeds apparently, which I have never suffered. You tend to think that no one believes all these things and perhaps it is all your fault, you are imagining everything, self worth gone. There are any thousands of PA/B12 sufferers now, more being diagnosed daily, yet once injections under the Guidelines are given I feel GP's happily wash their hands of you and put you in a ""sorted, no further treatment necessary"" box. Any suggestions most welcome, it is so good to know others suffer the same problems and share the fact that it is not just you, you really are not completely imagining your symptoms, making it up, not mad after all.On a similar tack as it may be caused by PA or not - I suffer also with Plantar Faciitis. For some months I am finding my feet, always cold, seem to be numb with no feeling underneath. I do the excercises, stand on my Vibrapower to get the circulation perhaps going. I cannot bear it if one of my cats walks across my legs, not pain but unpleasant as if my nerves in my legs stand on end. I do have ""restless legs"" regularly which is driving me mad. Mainly happens at night or late evening. Tried walking around, excercise, rubbing, creams and gels to no avail. My feet feel ""stretched"", I wear bedsocks as my feet have always been cold, after an hour or so giving a little comfort.I have heard that people with PA can have serious problems with their legs, some ending up in wheelchairs.

B12 Deficiency,large red blood cells?,"My son is 19, he's 6 feet tall and was obese. He's lost 8 and half stone over last two year and looks great! He has occasionally felt dizzy when standing up quick and fainted just once about one year ago. Recently he was at doctors for something else and doctor asked for bloods. Next day they rang and asked him if he had a lot of alcohol the night before, he was at home with us and had about 2 or 3 cans of lager with his dad but that was it. They asked him to go for another test as his B12 and folic acid was low. He went and had test done again, this time doctor said he just had larger than normal red blood cells and rest was fine not to worry. Well my son isn't but everyone knows mums like to worry, and I am worried that there is something underlining. I know he's not a heavy drinker and he lives at home. Anyone had anything similar? "

B12 Deficiency,B12 Deficiency,"I went to the doctors for years complaining about being exhausted all the time. Despite many blood tests which they say didn't show anything my doctors blamed it on my lifestyle - busy mum, 3 children, etc etc At age 39 I collapsed and was admitted to hospital with terrible abdominal pains and hourly collapses. I spent a week in hospital and was then discharged with 'we think you are depressed, here's some anti- depressants. I disagreed but they insisted I had depression. I saw a private consultant not long after who immediately diagnosed a severe B12 and foliate deficiency. They were dangerously low to the point of non-existent. No self help would have helped as malabsorption was the cause, which means I can't get B12 from natural sources. Sadly, the deficiency also kicked off early menopause. I also now have osteo-arthritis. I'm pretty appalled that doctors are still failing to pick up this deficiency which has long term and irreversible consequences. I'm also disappointed that they blame it on lifestyle and treat you like you are neurotic or just making it up. My advice to anyone suffering from unexplained tiredness is to go back and ask specifically for B12 levels to be checked. Your body is supposed to store 3 years worth while your liver is supposed to store 3 months worth hence 12 weekly injections I'm dependent on.

B12 Deficiency,Looking for an answer !,"Sorry, this is a long moan!Two years ago I had three ""episodes"" and my gp did lots of tests and referred me to consultants that ruled out diabetes and thyroid problems and didn't come up with anything thru' blood tests/heart checks.So I decided that I'd have to get on with it .It's left me very mussy headed and prone to headaches.My memory is appalling and my vocabulary has been affected, at first I'd start sentences and forget how to end them!I used to love reading but now I don't seem to concentrate on reading books and lose interest.Poor sleep and constant tiredness; it feels as though every part of my body is exhausted.Basically, I'm ticking all the boxes for pernicious anemia except the breathing problems (only when things are very bad). and thick tongue.Anyway, the main problem is that sometimes when I go out for a walk my brain,eyes and feet don't want to co-operate, I get exhausted and feel that I'm going to fall.I'm getting frightened of going out on my own.I'm also concerned that I've recently started to get pain in my left shin and numbness/tingling in my left foot, which can make walking even harder as I feel as though I'm limping a bit.So the doctors have ruled some things out and I'm pretty sure that I've been diagnosed with menopausal female syndrome and the doctor would love to give me a prescription for anti-depressants but I think it's auto-immune and I'm fed up and want to go out again on my own without being frightened.I have mild raynauds, white patches on my arms like vitiligo,I've had hyperthyroidism in the past and I'm allergic to the sun and cosmetics.I have a very poor digestive system, sometimes my stomach just refuses to work, I get bloating,gas and constipation; it's pretty useless. For over a decade I get headaches and weakness and have to just stop everything and rest for a couple of days!I know that my neice has auto-immune problems including fibromyalgia,ibs and vitamin deficiency and we've a good family history of type 2 diabetes and thyroid problems.

B12 Deficiency,How long for symptoms to return?,"I suffered from b12 deficiency a couple years ago and was given injections 5 or 6 injections and was sent on my way as my levels were now ""high enough"". Fast forward 2 years and I've started feeling horribly tired again. I slept 9 hours last night and I don't feel like I moved or woke once. (Fitbit tells me I had a restful sleep) but my eyes feel super heavy, and I am very sensitive to the light and just feel tired. I'm also having problems with my tonsils at the moment and are waiting to get these out, So I am on antibiotics frequently. Anyway, my question is has anyone else who's was only given a certain amount of injections levels dropped again? And how long did it take to get low again? Thanks! "

B12 Deficiency,Could it be the pill?,"I have had a blood test that shows my B12 levels are very low, my doctor initially suspected Celiac disease however a test for this came back negative. I am currently awaiting the results of a test to see if my intrinsic factor levels are normal as my doctor now thinks 'some other autoimmune disease' is causing the low B12.I am trying not to dwell on the possible cause however I suffer from anxiety, depression and OCD (seriously I've got the lot!) and waiting for the result is agonising!I have seen a couple of studies that suggest a link between low B12 and taking oral contraceptives. This seems to be one of the most recent studies: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3410054/ there is also quite a lot of anacdotal reports of a link on the internet.I have been taking the pill for around 12 years, for the majority of that time I have been taking it 'back to back' with only two breaks a year. I have checked with various doctors and have always been told that this was ok to do. I am now wondering if taking the pill this way for such a long period of time could actually be the cause of the B12 deficiency.Has anyone else had any experience of a link between oral contraceptives and B12 deficiency?"

B12 Deficiency,High mcv/mch,Hi recently had bloods done. Only thing abnormal is evevated mcv and mch which doctors were doing nothing about. My b12 serum was ok as well as folate in fact doctor commented that b12 was at the higher end of normal. Do this leaves the mcv mch unexplained. A b12/ folate def would explain my symptoms especially muscle twitching for 4 years!!! As well as this earlier this year my sister was told she had b12/folate deficiency and was prescribed meds. Should I do something about this? 
B12 Deficiency,Numbness in legs ,"Hi, I was diagnosed with PA on October 2016 and have had my initial round of injections and now get one injection every 2 months.

It's not even when my levels are low, it's all the time.

B12 Deficiency,Low B12 = Pernicious Anemia?,"Hello all,Last winter (2015-16) I was sick, sick, sick. Anytime someone would sneeze near me I would catch pneumonia, bronchitis, or at least sinusitis. In the spring my doctor ran a whole bunch of blood tests and one of the things that came from that was that I had low B12. She didn't say it was causing my sickness, but that it makes you run down so you feel worse when you are sick, and have take more time with healing. I was getting B12 injections every month, and she kept testing my levels every 3 months to see if I still needed them. But I noticed that by the 4th week I was extremely tired, lightheaded and irritable, so she increased the shots to every 3 weeks. I still don't feel great. So tired all the time. I have a lot of lightheadedness, including orthostatic hypotension (which gets way worse when I'm fighting any infection). I have borderline low blood pressure (usually in the low 90s over 50s-60s), not sure if that is related. I don't sleep well - I often wake up 2-3 times a night and have trouble going back to sleep, or even if I seem to sleep through the night, my husband or my Fitbit tells me I've been tossing and turning all night. I even went to a sleep doctor and she ruled out sleep apnea and said to check for anxiety. I have days - sometimes just portions of days - where everything is just too hard - and I have 2 kids under age 5 so there's little chance of staying in bed until I feel up to anything. I don't think I'm anxious or depressed, but the irritability makes me wonder.I asked my doctor a couple of times what causes this B12 deficiency. She says, ""in some people, your body isn't able to absorb the B12 that you get from food."" But why?? She doesn't have any more answers than that, she just says that there is a deficiency and so we are treating it. I don't have gastric issues (that I know of - although I do get constipation), I eat animal products. She has never tested for IF. She has done some CBCs which show normal hemoglobin, so is that why she's not calling it Pernicious Anemia? I just came upon that name when a doctor I was talking to (not as a patient) heard that I get regular B12 shots, and he said oh, you have percanous anemia? He was pronouncing it wrong so it took me a while to look it up ;-). My main question is, does it matter what we call it? I guess a diagnosis can be helpful in some ways in itself, but would the treatment be any different if we knew it was pernicious anemia? There was one test result that came back: ""RBC Morphology ABNORMAL"", is that common in PA? I don't think she has tested ferritin or folate, which I see has been recommended in this forum - what would be the benefit of knowing if those were abnormal, and what additional treatment would be needed?Thanks for any help or advice. I think I have a good doctor, but she is often rushed so it will help to know exactly what to ask or say if I need to get more help than I am getting.Hello all,Last winter (2015-16) I was sick, sick, sick.

B12 Deficiency,Low B12 Levels. ,"Last year I was told by my doctors that one of vitamin levels were borderline so they refused me any treatment they wouldn't even mention what that vitamin was. Then January this year I had blood tests done which revealed my b12 levels were low. My doctor put me on 6 booster shots within two week then told me I'd have to get these injections every three month for life. My doctor constantly avoided telling me what my actual level of b12 was she also kept telling me it's my diet but I eat a lot of food that has b12 in and everytimrnI questioned her if there was something else causing this problem but she's adamant on telling me it's my diet and when I asked her if it was possible by me changing my whole diet would it increase my b12 levels she told me they wouldn't it's a very rare occasion in a case like mine for that to happen. I just can't understand if it was my diet then wouldn't that be an issue I could fix instead of being on injections for life. I feel like she's not been completely honest or just palming me off and I just wanted other people's opinions on this. I have my next injection in two weeks and since last week I've been exhausted nearly fainting at work, falling into things it's getting to the point where it's really stressing me out because my doctor doesn't seem to want to answer my questions or put my mind at rest.

B12 Deficiency,Am I anemic or not?,"Hi! I'm new here and I'm searching for people who have gone through this long diagnosis process like I have. For years (like 15) people have told me I'm anemic. I've always been underweight. I have severe depression and anxiety and I'm exhausted all the time. Last May, I got to a point where I was tired of doctors dismissing me by blaming my depression. I convinced a doc to test for a million things that could possibly relate to my symptoms. She did and my parietal cells test as well as my mitochondrial tests came back positive. She told me to retest them. Fast forward to last month when new insurance kicked in and I've now been tested 4x with them both still being positive. In addition, I'm seeing a gastro doc for continued bowel inconsistencies. My Hematologist did 15 vials of tests and said everything looked ok but we needed to see if we could boost my b12 and folate for the next month before confirmed PA. I've been taking them for 3 days now and I'm more exhausted now then I was when I wasn't taking them. Is this the normal process?

B12 Deficiency,Struggling with lightheadedness low b12.,"Greetings all,I am a 25 year old male living in the netherlands and i suffer from a couple things that make my day to day life not enjoyable.I have been struggling with b12 for some time now.The first time i experienced low b12 was over a year ago. I felt weak and was constant lightheaded/dizzy. I went to the doctor and got myself a blood test. Both my vitamine D and B12 were low. I was getting vitamine D D-cura capsules 25.000 ie once per week,and b12 injections called hydroxocobalamine.I started getting b12 injections once per week. I remember how good i felt and how happy i was. The first injection already made me feel so much better. I was relieved and i continued getting injections every week for 5 weeks. After my 5th and final injections i had another blood test and everything came back fine. I went home and the doctor believed i was cured.5 months later; All of mine low b12 symptoms started comming back. I started worrying and asked for another blood test and with no suprise my b12 was again way to low.By this time i switched doctors ( for insurrance reasons) This time i got 2 injections per week as my treatment, basicly double as much as my previous treatment. Sadly this time my treatment had no effect. I continued feeling awfull. Fast forward 5 weeks and i have had my 10th and final injection for now. The doctor adviced me to wait 2 weeks and then have another blood test so i did. This time i tested multiple things including folic acid and iron. My test came back today and everything came back fine. My folic acid was fine my iron was fine and my b12 was over 1200. That is why i came to this forum to seek for advice because i have no idea what to do anymore. I cant keep on feeling like this.My symptems are; Feeling weak tired all day longlightheaded/ dizzy especially when moving head to fast.Tinkeling hands/feet that randomly occur during the day.Feeling bloated alot especially at night in bed.I also suffer from anxiety but that is something i had for atleast 10 years now.I hope that someone can help me with some advice.Thanks for taking your time to read about my struggeles.Greetings Rico "
B12 Deficiency,folic acid and b 12 ,"Hi my daughter is 23 and has had burning feet at night for many years.....doctors could nver understand why. He live in ireland and she is at university in rochester. Recently she has been complaining of hair loss generak depression burning feet tiredness and she had to come home even though her finals are in a few weeks. She had a blood test and was low in folic acid and given folic acid supplements.She was told her red blood cells were enlarged also. After a month of being here and taking 5 mg of folic acid she has gone back to university.....however she still feels unwell,,,,,,more hair loss fatigue burning feet....making her depressed also. I am very worried about her. I was reading the link with b12 and thought maybe she should be taking this....on her blood result her b12 was in the normal level. Maybe it takes a while before u feel better? Does any one here suffer from anything simular? many thanks"
B12 Deficiency,B12...confused?,"Hello All,I was diagnosed with B12 deficiency this week and began daily 5mg folic acid treatment.This was done briefly by phone so I didn't get the chance to ask much about it.It might sound ridiculous...but I seem to have been even more tired since I started on the folic acid?!?(I read elsewhere on the forum that this could be due to the treatment starting to repair the damage caused by the B12 deficiency?)I've had a roller coaster year with major prolapse surgery last August with a very slow recovery and now rectal dysfunction - neurological - resulting in chronic constipation.I suspect my B12 issue may have been long standing...possibly 2 years or more.My Dr. mentioned she wanted to see if my gut was able to absorb B12.Would that be why she prescribed tablets rather than injections?My Dad had pernicious anaemia in his 70's and I've also been on a proton pump inhibitor for 4 years for hiatus hernia.I've had to adopt a low residue diet for several months due to the chronic constipation issue and have a very poor appetite.I'm sleeping an average of 10-12 hours a day and still feel bone weary.I'm only 63 but feel like a little old lady with constant joint/muscle pain and simple everyday things requiring a major effort and leaving me exhausted afterwards.Any information/advice would be really appreciated.

B12 Deficiency,"Dx'd with ""Vitamin B Deficiency""","Hi everyone,Recently I got a blood panel done to check my vitamin B, D, and thyroid levels. I was told (via voicemail) that my D and thyroid levels were normal, but my white blood cell count was slightly elevated (might just be normal for me) and my vitamin B levels were ""very low,"" at a 7.Now, I've done some extensive Googling and can only find that B12 normal levels are between 200 and 500 pg/mL... is it possible that mine are 7 pg/mL, or was my doctor's assistant referring to another ""scale"" for vitamin B in general? I find it hard to believe that I could be at a 7 when the low end of normal is 200! I've also read about a few causes of this deficiency, but nothing really makes sense for me... I've been trying to eat less animal products, but I don't believe I'm eating so little of them to cause a deficiency this extreme. I also don't have any other conditions except some mental health concerns (which could frankly be caused by the deficiency itself). My grandfather has a deficiency as well... could it be hereditary? I mean, Jesus, I'm only 21!Yes, I realize I could just call my doctor's office back, but then I would engage in phone tag for days on end since I can only leave message for my doctor. Any help you can offer would be appreciated! (If you're concerned, I'm starting an prescribed, oral supplement today to get my vitamin B back up.)Much obliged,Allison"
B12 Deficiency,Can symptoms get worse after taking B12 1000 mcg tabs?,"Hi there I started off with a numb foot for past 4 months. I then take 2-3 days of High Dose Vitamin B tablets, 2 days later I have a whole host of ghastly neuro symptoms completely out of the blue, dizziness, confusion, eyesight problems, extreme anxiety, insomnia and nerve tremors in both legs. These on the whole subside 2 days later leaving tingling in both feet and legs. 2 days later I start 1000mcg sub B12 tablets and the tingling is worse and my calf musles are stiff - what is going on???? Can taking such high doses of B12 make things worse, is the dose too strong for me or is this a normal reaction???? Dont know what to do - stop or carry on. Feel inclined to start on B12 injections (pending formal blood tests results) and forget worry of my allergies and whether I might react to B12 injections and just go for them without further delay - what is the worst that can happen??? If it does transpire I have some horrible degenerative nerve disease can taking B12 in such high does make things worse??? I would not be surprised to have B12 deficiency - been vegan for years, have count of 282 and displaying text book signs. My neurologist doesnt believe its possible to get B12 deficiency unless you are over 60 with kidney or liver disease and a count of under 200 - that surely cant be right. I am so confused. Anything anyone can add from experience would be so much appreciated. Tracey"

I then asked my dr. to do a vitamin d test along with vitimin b1 b6 and b 12. she argued with me and said because my iron done by finger stick was at 12 so it was not possible to be b deficient. after basically arguing and crying she gave in...my d level was an 8 and mormal is 30 to 100...i am on 50 tousand units once a week for two months. my b12 was 286 normal being 200 to 1100. so low end of normal. b1 was 88 normal being 78 to 185 and b6 was 10.2 normal being 2.1 to 21.7. i didnt know about folate acid so no test done and going to request it. i have had constant shortness of breath and alway feel full. constant fatigue sleeping 15 hours a day sometimes. i have burning in my heels with extreamly cold hands and feel and hands and feet seem to fall asleep all the time like pins and needles. ihave heart palpitations more when i first wake up but through the day to.i am having a halter monitor put on next week. i also have blurred vision along with being able to regulate my body temputure, i have burning eyes sometimes and pain hrough my body. i have lost 16 pounds in a mnth but trying to diagnose myself i started eating better as i never ate much sometimes a couple days without eating. i have forced myself to eat at least once a day and trying to do smoothies with fresh fruits and tumeric and such. i am hoping my weight loss is due to cuttting out dring anywhere from 4 to 6 cans of soda and 3 to 4 cups of coffee with cream and sugar each day. the last mouth i have drank tart cheery juice and water eating sweet potatoes and chicke. hoping the weight loss is due to that. i have had many test and many more to go, i am looking for a new dr. as she sent me away with 4 perscriptions for anxiety which i dont have until i have the harder time breathing. i have never had anxiety. trying to diagnose my illness i change my diet often. at first i though i had sarcoid but pulmonary said no along with the x rays. waiting on a mold test results to see if its that in my house as i cleaned mold from my batroom with no thought of using a mask. it was about a month later i got sick. going to ask for blood work for that but i am sure i will get a fight. i am currently looking for a new dr. my question is my b 12 low enough it was 286 to make me this sick along with my d being an 8. my dr told me to stop looking for something wrong and i couldnt believe that as she is doing very little. i dont go to the dr unless i am sick havent been in years now she is just blowing me off. this is the same dr. who begged me to come in for my check ups....any help would be greatly appriciated. i feel like i am chasing a rat around in circles in a room and this has become an obsession to figure this out i feel that bad. i just want some quality of life back...please any help is greatly appriciated more than you know. i am not from the uk but you all seem to know more than anyone i have talked to . i live in new hampshire not sure if that makes a difference. drs. hhere are not what they use to be its all about money and is sad.......thank you all for reading my long post."
B12 Deficiency,Recently diagnosed b12 deficient...insights appreciated!,"Hi all, I've recently been diagnosed as having a b12 deficiency and am still looking for answers to a questions. I know I should ask the doctor but our time slots for the injections are so short I never seem to get the time.A bit of background: the reason I was initially sent for blood tests was because I went to the doctor complaining of chest pain (a tight band across my chest intermittently). When asked about other general health I mentioned I constantly felt tired by about 2pm regardless of how much I had slept. However, I was still about to go out and socialise despite being quite wiped out after. He send me for an ECG (clear) and blood tests (FBC as well as intolerance/coeliac tests and I have constant stomach cramps). These came back with a b12 level of 154 and he recommended 6 injections of b12 over 2 weeks, then once a month every three months with repeat bloods to be done in 6 months to see if my levels are raising. So my questions are as follows:It seems like in the last few weeks I've been getting even worse fatique - having to cancel plans and barely making it through the whole work day fatigue. A few weeks ago I was struck down with what we presumed was a virus for four days - unable to stay awake and had to take time off work as I was so weak. Since then I've noticed a definite worsening of how tired I get. Its like a whole body weakness vs. just being a bit sleepy. Is it normal to have some periods where b12 deficiency causes bad fatigue and others where you feel just a bit sleepy?Also - does anyone know the likelihood of my intolerance/coeliac tests coming back as positive? These apparently take longer to come back but I'm anxious to know if there's a positive association between the two. Thirdly (almost done!) - can someone actually clarify when a b12 deficiency is just that vs. when it becomes anaemiaFinally (!) - What is the likelihood that my repeat bloods will come back normal i.e. just have this course of treatment is enough to keep my levels up?Thanks in advance for anyone who actually reads all this!!!"

B12 Deficiency,"Previous b12 deficiency, now having symptoms again. w long does it take to become deficient in b12? ","Last year I finally went to the doctors after having some vague symptoms for quite a while, such as tiredness, dizzy spells, occasional blurred vision and an occasional ""weakness"" type feeling in my hands. I had various blood tests done and it was discovered that I had a b12 deficiency. The doctor prescribed one b12 injection per week for 6 weeks and after this the blood test was repeated and I was told that the b12 was back to an acceptable level. This was back in august. It's now march, and I feel like I'm having some of the symptoms again. Not so much the fatigue, but I keep getting a feeling of weakness in my left hand and lower arm and have started having dizzy spells again, which is the main symptom. It happens at least once a day, sometimes more, but usually only lasts a couple of seconds. I also get weird palpitations sometimes too, it feels like a flutter in my chest or as though my heart skips a beat. And I'm also nearly always constipated (TMI sorry) and I get really bloated and uncomfortable after even a small meal or snack. Is it possible for my b12 to have run low again already? I've read before that supplies usually last a really long time, usually years, so not sure if I could be deficient again after just 7 months, but all the symptoms are the same as last time. I eat a normal diet including loads of meat and fish and last time I was deficient they did an antibody test (not sure what it was for?) on my blood sample which was normal.

B12 Deficiency,New need help,"HiI'm looking for some advice please.Im 34yr old and for about 6months now I had been feeling totally exhausted and tired all the time no matter how much I slept I was still tired but I just put it down to work and 3 kids.Ivery since developed other systoms the most worrying was anxiety and feeling really low again I was too scared to say anything,I started to feel on edge all the time and unable to make any decisions and just not feeling myself at all,I've got a rash on my right leg that I have actually tore the skin because of itching,then there's the bloating and wind all the time,my stomach always looks pregnant,so I went to the Dr and they tried to palm me off with all sorts of the same exudes I was using myself! But I knew you now it wasn't right how I was feeling good so I persevered and she arranged bloods to be done,I've just had a call today from the receptionist to say my b12 is low,my vitamin d is low and my folate levels are low and the Dr wants to see me to discuss treatment but the first appointment isn't till the 31st so as you can imagine I'm now googling like mad to see what this all means and why I'm not been seen sooner? Apparently the receptionist says if the Dr thought it was serious I would be seen sooner,this isn't helping how am feeling just now and is making the anxiety symptoms worse,anyone else have all 3 of these low? If they are low does it necessarly mean a deficiency? Would any of this have anything to do with my liver? I've had a liver function test in the past that came back slightly raised,sorry for the millions of questions but I just can't wait 3 weeksThanks "

B12 Deficiency,B12 Results ,"Hi everyone I just wanted some advice please - I recently went to my doctor as I have been feeling exhausted, complete loss of libido, generally mood-wise feeling down and worried, I was having difficulty remembering things, feeling cold all the time - getting worse over the last year. My Doctor did a FBC and a thyroid test and everything was in the normal range except B12 was low (162 - range is 200-900). She said I would need to come in for B12 injections and did a repeat test 1 week later to confirm but this time the result was 230. She said that was great news, it must be diet related and to eat more B12 and come back in a few months if I don't feel better.I feel really down now, I was relieved that maybe there was an explanation for the symptoms and now I just feel like a hypochondriac. Is there anything else I should be doing? "

B12 Deficiency,Don't know what's wrong with me...any ideas?,"For the past for months, I've been having symptoms that are very distracting. When I have something wrong with me, my first instinct is to ignore it. I don't like telling people about my problems, so I wait until something really bad happens to do it. I am aware that that's not a very smart thing to do, but I do tend to do it for whatever reason.It all started a few months ago. I kept having pain or just uncomfortable feelings around my upper abdomen. They'd come and go, but these were easy to ignore, so I didn't think anything of it. Then one night the feelings in my abdomen got worse and I started having chest pain as well. I went to tell someone, but as soon as I tried to speak I felt like I was going to faint and I couldn't talk. I was having trouble breathing. So I walked away and wondered what to do.After this, every time I sat down, my legs would start shaking. That only happened after a few seconds of sitting down.I finally showed someone what my legs were doing. They told my mom, who took me to the hospital. She had to hold me up because I still felt like I was going to faint. According to her, I looked really pale.I spent hours at the hospital and had some tests done, and no one could find anything wrong, except things that had to do with my heart (explained below).My mom's convinced I have either an iron or B12 deficiency. She said that the tests they did for those aren't accurate at hospitals, because they told her a while ago that her iron was normal and then another doctor told her that it was way too low after they did a more advanced test. The doctor said that I might just have anxiety. She thought the whole time that I was nervous at the hospital (no idea why) when really I felt calm and peaceful there. I really don't think this is anxiety. She also said that my heart rate was too high even though I had been laying down for hours and I had a heart murmur. I could feel my heart beating in my chest while I was there, and this was a new symptom. So a while after all of this happened, I keep getting new symptoms. Here is a list of the ones I can remember:- Lower back pain and aching- Sharp pain in back of my neck (this could just be my muscle though, but it feels like an electric shock...very painful)- This only happens once in a while and doesn't last long, but pins and needles in both legs while I'm walking- Sharp pain on the left side of my chest, right where my lung is in a specific spot - this causes me to only be able to take tiny breaths at a time because it is painful- TIREDNESS: this is the biggest, most distracting symptom. If this would only go away, things would be much better. I think this might have been the first or second symptom I had. I just feel weak and extremely tired, like I'll fall asleep at any moment, even though I get plenty of sleep and have no trouble falling/staying asleep- Lightheadedness- Feeling like I'm not getting enough oxygen- Weird tingling sensation in my mouth (it is hard to describe, but it's like tiny little shocks all over my tongue).I just want all of this to go away. I can't get work done without some new symptom appearing that causes me to not be able to concentrate. As I said, my mom thinks this could be a B12 deficiency. Does it sound like that, based on the symptoms I'm having? I rarely eat meat (I was a vegetarian my whole life, from the time a was born, then a strict vegan for a few years, then I started trying to eat dairy, eggs, fish, etc.), so maybe that caused it?"

B12 Deficiency,B12 loading injection making internal vibrations worse? ,"Hi, Thanks for reading this post. I am asking on behalf of my wife who is very low in B12.

B12 Deficiency,Newly diagnosed but unsure...,"Hello all,So yesterday I was diagnosed with having pernicious anemia and had my first injection today.I have had many stomach problems over the past 5 years such as bloating, diaorrhea, cramps etc and keep being told it's viruses, dietary, all sorts. The dr didn't want to test me for Crohns purely because ""I don't bleed when I go to the toilet"" even though I had a test a couple of years ago that flagged crohns.Could the pernicious anemia give me these symptoms? I'm just worried that there's something else going on and it will just be passed on as this.Thank you for your reading "
B12 Deficiency,"Treating b12 deficiency for more than a year, problem still persist.","Hello everyone, this will be long. So my main problem is b12 deficiency, which I developed while being vegetarian ( circa 3 years). I started to consume meat, because I had developed severe health issues although I hadn't been diagnosed. After eating meat for a year and a half I still didnt feel good, in fact, my ""illness"" progressed quite rapidly still. Whrn at last I was diagnosed with b12 def. And started to supplement with it. Still after a year I feel ill, but my symptoms are weird: my ankles feel like they are being locked, bc I cant lift my foot in 90 degrees, that influences my knees and hips and even my back . I feel like my ankles have been deformed ( developed higher arch, toe ball has become flatter and wider). I've always had one leg longer than the other, but only insignificantly, now I feel like my longer leg drags and overall have this feeling like walking penguin. Because my problems with legs seem not to be shared amongst those who suffer from b12, I couldnt diagnose myself. Now I just dont believe that b12 gonna help me. I also have memory problems and have become dumber in general bc of this. Maybe smb could understand what this case with legs is? Also when supplimenting with b12 I feel general pain in my hands and other parts of the body, also while exercising I feel not that relaxing muscle pain ( although that also), but paindul, stiff sensation in my muscles and bones even. Anyway the main problem is legs. I can't even stan comfortably, also walking on uneven ground is painful to me. Im only 23. Became vegetarian at 18. Started to eat meat again when I was 21 or 20.

B12 Deficiency,B12 level testing how do I know results are correct when I doubt them,My problem is that the neurologist that I trust and believe says my b12 levels are correct. But he maybe be wrong Problem I have is that due to various reasons I'm sure my problems are due to degrading mylene sheath due to b12 deficiency. My nann ended up on tablets for nerve issues and my mum was diagnosed with TM 4 years before she died. Which if she had b12 Def then that would be a factor why she had TM. I believe I have a b12 problem maybe due to genetics. My mums doctors notes where destroyed about 1 year ago. Why is it in this country next of kin get asked about destroying some Ines medical notes. When in fact it's the genetically connected people i.e. Me my mums son. Who now could use the info in my mums notes to figure out a possible genetic problem. Especially that I have 4 children if my own. I have nerve problems in my spine that is causing muscle atrophy and muscle spasms and electrical shocks in my legs. Doctors say I've had some infection in my spine or something that has caused inflammation and my bodies immune system has been stacking the nerves now I'm on steroids to remove inflammation and just about to start some other tablets to calm my nerves down!! But I still believe I have a mylene sheath problem due to b12 deficiency there is a genetic problem where you can have only 1x PMPH22 gene when you should have 2 this leads to mylene sheath problems with my family history I believe this is a possibility but doctors don't seem to believe this as a possibility.

B12 Deficiency,Pernicious Anemia why am I getting worse,"Hi, Thank you in advance in short, I was diagnosed with pernicious anemia 2 years ago, after having complete shutdown, mostly effecting my limbs but somtimes face, numbness, vibrations, twitching, eventually jerking of my arms and legs to where I couldnt walk for more than 10 minutes, Im 35 lived in China at the time, they did every test, found out my grandma and 3 others in family had pa. My b12 was 123 and my splene was very enlarged, that w fam history they started me on b 12 injections, over next year slowly got better, untill the point where most days I felt pretty normal, I started sublingual after 6 months 3 /500mg a day. Overall controlled. I just moved to Taiwan one month ago and found some sublinguals here, different brand, I had a complete crash after two weeks on them, as I couldnt find the methycolbal sublinguals I took in China I started on the methycolbal injections 500 mg once a day for a week then every few days, but I still feel terrible, my legs and arms are extremely weak, and I have a lot of the muscle twitching back in my face around my lips and numbness and tingling and vibrations in my limbs, extreme shortness of breath, not to mention Im very short w my family( I have two young sons n hubby) Also I am taking folic, should I take more shots a day as my previous sublingual was 3 at 500 mg and the shot is only once at 500mgAm I being impatient, maybe this is because I crashedand also why do I need so much everyday is that normal? I cant even imagine having to wait 1 or 3 months for a shot, I wouldnt be able to walk. Thank you in advance for your thoughts, Also most of my research is just trying to look it up online since my Chinese is still very limited to comunicate with doctors here. Thank youB"
B12 Deficiency,Symptoms and B12 injection side effects,"Hi all,So finally diagnosed with pernicious anemia after a long time of knowing something wasn't right.My symptoms over the years were:-Big toes numb on both feet for a long time - fully investigated at time, they couldn't find a reason.Cognitive decline in form of memory loss, forgetfulness, confusion, unable to think as quickly. Had a few random periods like this eg can't think of a common wordFreezing cold hands and feet - always thought it was poor circulation- this cleared up within a month after loading does injectionsHeavy legs (not fat,) a lot of effort walking - generally thought I was unfit, cleared up after 2 weeks after loading dose- also after each injection on same day my legs felt unbelievably light maybe a bit like jelly. After 2 weeks generally light.About half an hour after each injection I got shooting pains usually in my feet, hands, then moved on to legs and arms, sometimes just one limb. Prob only lasted about 3 minutes for each one. Felt as if each injection was felt in an area of my body.Fatigue always complaining and sighing of being tired- many times to the doctors about this one- never got sorted until now. About 2 weeks after loading dose I went for a run, the same distance as before injections, same number of stops, but was not at all out of breath, could talk while running, massive improvement in physical ability in exercise - so was no where near as unfit as I thought I was.I am now on 2 months after my loading does, my nails have suddenly changed from be dish to very hard, my hair unfortunately is going a bit curly/ wavy at roots, was like this about 15 years ago.Had bad reaction to b12 injections, had a pimple/sandpaper like rash across forehead and scalp, cleared up after about 6 weeks, was pretty nasty, and I never usually get spots! Used duac cream after 4 weeks that may also have helped.IBS like stomach problems completely cleared up since injections even slight intolerance to dairy has gone.Periods have returned to how they used to be a long time ago, always had and been regular but they are much heavier.My level was 119 when diagnosed, been given hydroxy form of b12. Never found any with some of my symptoms so thought I would inform others of what to expect with treatment."
B12 Deficiency,Started B!2 Injections and have questions. I would really be thankful for any insight here.,"I did a Micronutrient test and found out my B12 levels and Biotin were really really bad. my whole life i have thought there was something wrong with me i couldnt put my finger on. I am 32 and am just FINALLY finding some answers. I even thought I had ADD and was put on VYVANSE. If you have ever taken that you know it gives you alot of energy but for me even while taking that i felt like everyday was a marathon i had to push through for lack of energy. I have 2 toddlers so I do it. I force myself to get things done but i feel like i am fighting this intense exhastion inside me. So, I did 5 Methyl b12 injections 5 days in a row and now i am on them once a week for 12 weeks. on top of that i take a Thorne basic nutrients 2/day with an additional 600mcg methyl B-12 , 400mcg menthyfolate and 500 mcgs of biotin. Then even in addition to that i take a 10,000 mcg plain biotin and a liquid dropper of 2500mcg meythl B-12 with an extra 400 mcg methylfolate added into that.The 5 days and 2 days after taking the shots with all of this i felt soooo much better!!!! I wasnt Tired, my back muscles used to hurt and be so tense that i would have to constant heat and get massages once a week, i would get winded easily, had memery problems ( hense the ADD) , get this weird tingling in my back, have weird bouts of constipation and IBS type symptoms, sometimes even in the middle of talking to people mid story my mind would go blank and i felt so akward. All of this was so much better in those 5 days and even two days after i stopped the shot for the week. The third day i noticed things slowly comming back even though the only thing I stopped was the shots. I was still taking all those other suppliments. The biggest thing i notice is the Severe tiredness I feel again every single day all day after 2 days of not taking the shots. Is this normal? Does anyone know orr did you exprerience the same thing? I was so happy that all these things i have lived with forever were getting better and its a very defeating feeling that they are coming back. I wasnt sure if it takes a while for your body to get regular, like maybe i will be on this rollercoaster of ups and downs until my body realises it will get b12 regualarly. Anyway, I am curious and very thankful for any insight anyone has on this.P.s. I am so sorry for any misspelling. I know I spelled things wrong and thats how tiered i am. The thought of reading this over and correcting it seems exhasting. Today I get another shot and at least will have one once a week for 12 weeks so at least maybe i will have some more energy."
B12 Deficiency,B12 and folate deficiency,"Hi looking for some advice I have recently been feeling generally unwell , extremely tired , dizzy spells, my heart rate has been fluctuating between to rapid to too slow and being very short of breath at times. My b12 and folate levels where low and I was given a months supply of medication , had levels tested again and they where normal so medication was stopped .However this last week I have been feeling awful , and yet again levels are low and have been given another months supply. I take a high dose of acid suppressants which I believe may be causing this but does anyone else find gp quite dismissive of symptoms and not keen to treat ?? How did anyone go about deciding wether they needed regular treatment etc?I am usually quite fit and very active so finding this so fustrating that I can't get through a full day without needing to sleep on and offThanks"
B12 Deficiency,PA and FBC ,I have not been diagnosed with PA but have been told my level for b12 is 192 (this was 4/5 weeks ago) am waiting for another b12 test to come back now to check my levels again and take it from there.

B12 Deficiency,pernicious animea with having vitiligo,I had noticed segmental vitiligo in 2011 and thereafter dr did my blood test and said i have pa too as i was also having symptoms of pa.

B12 Deficiency,Are my symptoms from B12 deficiency?,"Hi there,I am hoping someone can help me as I am driving myself mad googling symptoms! Approximately 6 years ago a blood test found I had macrocytosis and folate deficiency. I was never prescribed anything for the folate deficiency as I was told I didn't need to worry unless I planned on getting pregnant. Around 1 year ago I had some blood tests done; again confirmed I had macrocytosis and was deficient in B12. The doctor said at the time that the levels were low enough to start injections however due to my age (22 at the time) he wanted to try supplements first. I took the supplements however have never had a follow up to this.I have been suffering terribly with different symptoms (the most noticeable being recurrent tongue ulcers, inflamed redness at tip of tongue and recurrent sores in my nose). I also feel extremely tired all the time, thin hair that doesn't grow and very brittle nails. At the moment my tongue is red at the tip with numerous ulcers and is so painful. Could this be due to a B12 deficiency?? Any help would be much appreciated - I'm driving myself crazy!! Thanks"
B12 Deficiency,Awaiting PA test,"Hi all, I have been in and out my Dr's for 12 months. I have had shingles 11 times in the last 12 months! I was taken in to A&E 12 months ago with heart palpitations and breathlessness (suspect heart attack turned out to be tachycardia) I am now 32.Since around Christmas time. I have been groggy, extremely tired, headaches, irritable and feeling low, frequent heart palpitations. The feeling of numbness in feet and hands.Last month I noticed a large lump just above my collar bone, I went to my GP and he said not to worry about it. He said it is most likely related to the recurring shingles. I had just got over another lot of shingles, 2nd time since May.Shingles returned with a vengeance last week and I had a funny turn whilst at work, my hands went numb and my heart was racing, my vision went blurry and I nearly collapsed. I was taken into hospital by ambulance. I had a blood test and my Dr Called me yesterday to discuss results.He said I had a B12 deficiency as my level was 179 and that I would need to start the injections ASAP. So I am booked in every other day for two weeks, then every 3 months. He then said I need to come back in for another blood test, as he wants to check for P.A . This is being done tomorrow.I have also discovered that my nan has PA and has injections every 3 months. My questions are, does anyone else experience recurring shingles with either PA or B12 defeciency? It is really getting me down, I now fear I have a urine infection to top it all off Also, does anyone actually get to the root of why they have PA? or do we just acquire it with time? Could you have always had it?I suppose all i can do now is await to hear if I have PA. I still have the lump above my collar bone, but my Dr is adamant it is a swollen lymph node due to shingles.Thanks for taking time to read this x"
B12 Deficiency,B12 Problem - Does this sound correct,"Back in Oct 15 I suddenly started feeling really tired, could barely stay awake in the afternoon, always cold, ulcers in mouth and pins/needles in hands and feet. I was told by my Doctor that I am B12 deficient but I have now been told by a Consultant Gastroenterologist it is Chronic Fatigue syndrome. I am 25 years old. I am sorry for the long winded details below but would really appreciate your views on whether this sounds correct. Thank you so much.Feb 16: B12 level 71 so need urgent injections. Doctor said my B12 level had been around this since Oct 15 but I had not been advised. I had six injections with the last one on 6 Apr. I had a bad reaction to the injections (rash) and was prescribed steroid and anti-biotic tablets.On 20 May my B12 level was 326. In mid-June my B12 level was 192 and I was started on supplement tablets. In mid-July by B12 level as 217.End July 16: Appointment with haematologist. No problem with blood cells in any test. Test for intrinsic factor / antibodies all fine so no evidence of Pernicious Anaemia. Suggests referral for gastro investigation. There was around 12 month waiting list for gastro so decided to seek private second opinion.Nov 16: Visited Consultant Gastroenterologist. He had a copy of all my medical and test results and went over everything. He advised that he does not believe that I am B12 deficient. He believes that the oral contraceptive pill is leading to inaccurate results on the blood tests. He said that the B12 latches to the hormone and travels around the blood so it is metabolised differently and leads to false levels being detected in the blood tests. He said that my blood cells looked very good with haemoglobin around 150 and all related tests absolutely fine (no anaemia ever). He is certain this is the issue but said the only way to put my mind to rest would be to stop the contraceptive pill or allow him to put a camera down my throat to check for atrophy (which he is happy to do if I wish to pursue this). He suggested that my symptoms were more likely due to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome."

B12 Deficiency,B12 Deficiency,"I was diagnosed with pernicious anemia in May. I had my loading dose of B12 and 1 booster since then, however some of my symptoms still remain.I still have difficulty with my vision at times and struggle to focus properly; I'm still feeling exceptionally tired and days when I'm at work, I'm asleep by 9 and weekends I need an afternoon nap if I want to do anything during the evening. But my biggest concern is the pain I feel, especially in my hands but also in my feet, at times too.Another thing is that my skin is in really poor condition and I requently get bad spots.Can anybody let me know if these things will improve or if I'm stuck with feeling 'rubbish' all the time." 
B12 Deficiency,Do I have Pernicious Anaemia?,"Hi AllI found out about my deficiency from regular checkup, it was 182. (which doesn't sound that low). I had to do injections everyday for a week, and now once a week for 4 weeks, then 1x monthly for life.He did a lot of blood tests, and ruled out autoimmune diseases. I get enough b12 in my diet so it's not that, which means My stomach is not making IF so I can't absorb it. Isn't that the definition of P-anemia?!He thinks it's due to my alcohol consumption (2-3 glasses of wine a Nite).I know alcoholics have B12 issues, but that's not my case.My question is, if i don't make IF, then doesn't that mean by default that I have P-anaemia? What blood tests should I have to confirm my hunch?Thanks so much!!Thank you,Lynn 0 Reply"
B12 Deficiency,"Totally confused.... Advice really needed, please","Hi,I've been put on B12 injections after my B12 levels were 66. While having an injection I asked the nurse why my levels were so long. She looked at my blood test results on her computer and told me my body was lacking intrinsic factor. She told me I therefore had pernicious anaemia. When I asked further questions about this condition she was very nice and as helpful as she could be but said ""I'm just a nurse, you'll need to speak with a doctor."" I therefore made an appointment with the doctor. The doctor told me my haemaglobin level is 16 so therefore, she said, I ""do not have pernicious anaemia"". She told me I would be anaemic if my haemaglobin level was below 13.5. She said 16 is good for my age - I'm 35 years old and male.I asked then what was causing my B12 to be so low and she shrugged and said ""life"".Can anyone tell me what they hell is going on, please?

B12 Deficiency,PA - newly diagnosed. ,"Hello all,I'm a bloke in his mid 30s. I've just been diagnosed with PA. Luckiky, my doctor (NHS) was on the ball and, presented with my symptoms, immediately requested a blood test with, crucially, a B12 check. My B12 count turned out to be just 66. Doctor immediately put me on a course of five B12 injections. I've just had my second jab but actually feel a lot worse than I did before, Has anyone else experienced this?My main symptoms remain as follows: dizziness, extreme tiredness (going to bed at 8.30pm) and brain fog. I've a toddler, my day job requires a lot of judgement calls and I'm volunteer lifeboat crew often getting paged in middle of the night, so these symptoms are impacting heavily on all areas of my life. While i know I will need injections for life, I'm keen to get it managed ASAP. How successful are the injections likely to be?I've been told I'm missing intrinsic factor (hence the IV approach) but I've nonetheless started upping my fruit and veg intake through shakes each morning (made with coconut water for extra potassium and magnesium while keeping sugar content down). Is it correct these two minerals are needed for the B12 shots to work?With no chance of overdosing on B12, I'm keen to explore other ways to bump up my intake. Anyone had much success with B12 patches?Finally, I might be prempting the doctor but from what I've read many people have struggled to obtain the required number of B12 shots. Is it safe ordering online? I'd be comfortable self-medicating.Can anyone give me any advice, please?Thanks for reading. "
B12 Deficiency,is this normal?,"Please, please can someone tell me if the feelings I am having are normal for a vitamin b12 deficiency. I have felt poorly for so long now and this week have finally had a letter from my doctor following blood tests - that I have a b12 and folic acid deficiency. I had my first injection on Thursday and have my next - including blood tests - on Monday. I just seem to have really deteriorated in the last few weeks and my question is really is it normal to feel tingling inside my head? Head feels like it is in clamps at the back and feels like there is movement inside. God that sounds weird!! Please could someone tell me I'm not going crazy. Just feel so yucky all the time. Have been dealing with the tiredness, nausea and dizziness but this just feels different. Looking forward to hearing any responses. Thank you xxxx"

B12 Deficiency,Help needed for vitamin b12 results!!! urgent,"Hi,My 33 year old husband has been a mess for past 3 months. He's having severe balance problem, extreme fatigue and bouts of depressions. ENT and Neuro have cleared him. He just got his B12 tested and the results are 207 ng/dl (reference ragne is 196.53-863.39). Now I have heard that levels at 200 are considered deficient. However, I am confused by the unit ng/dl. Couldn't find anywhere. Before we start any treatment, can any one please help me with the units? It is at the lower end of normal but I just need some help please! Its top urgent!"
B12 Deficiency,Getting b12 injections but still feeling the symptoms ,"First of all I'm not from the uk im Irish but Im hoping I'll still be able to get some answers. I am often prone to mouth ulcers and I get them fairly bad but took no notice. But in August I had them for nearly 2 weeks and they just werent going away so I went to the doctor hoping she would give me something to help I didn't think there was any underlying problems. So I went and she gave me an inhaler(I think it was steroids), a paste to put on after the inhaler to keep it in, a treatment for thrush (my tongue was completely white) and a pain killer which had some anti inflammatorys in it. She also took my bloods, which I thought was just a precaution but a few days later I got a call off her secretary saying my b12 and folate was low and that I should come in and she would explain everything. Looking back I had been in a constant bad mood but at the time I didn't think anything of it and I had been quiet tired but just put it down to working 50 hours a week waitressing (on my feet all day).I went in but she didn't explain much only how to inject the b12 (she told me to take orovite tablets for 2 months, they're nearly gone now). So she never actually mentioned the words pernicious anemia to me but I think I do have it as she gave me a prescription for 10 injections, 1 everyday for 5 days and after that every 3 months, and when I asked how long these injections were for she said 'from now on' and to get my bloods checked every year. My mom had just a normal check up a few days after me and she thinks that she did mention pernicious anemia to her and she said she tested me for celiac disease too but I didn't have it. So it's been nearly 2 months since I had the last of my 5 injections and my next one should be around mid November but I've got mouth ulcers again fairly bad I haven't eaten properly all week I'm starving but the pain of hunger is more bareable than the pain of eating. I'm feeling quite tired again as well, unable to stay awake in lectures (I'm back at college now) but not in the really bad mood that I was before. Is it normal to still have symptoms even though I'm being treated? Thanks in advance. "
B12 Deficiency,Low b12 not anemia very confused,Hi everyone my story is abit complicated I went to the doctor a few weeks ago with symptoms of what I thought was ulcerative coilitis I was diagionsed with this about 3 years ago but haven't had any more problems. So he wanted to do some bloods to see if there was inflammation there wasn't but my b12 was low so they gave me some tablets for that my Toluca acid was also low so some for that too. Then he did a blood test to check for pernicious anemia too that came back today negative. I'm really confused as I was convinced it was the anemia and that more than likely I'd get injections but reading through the Internet on why people don't have enough b12 it seems like it's diet related! Could it be related to coilitis I just feel like i don't know very much about either condition Hi everyone my story is abit complicated I went to the doctor a few weeks ago with symptoms of what I thought was ulcerative coilitis I was diagionsed with this about 3 years ago but haven't had any more problems.

B12 Deficiency,B12 level 156 - GP won't treat,"Feeling worse than ever, can't even manage a flight of stairs without being totally out of breath. So so exhausted, nerve pain (although I do have a back issue so not sure if related to that) dizzy spells to the point that I'm worried about driving. Can't walk along a corridor without veering off to the side feeling giddy and as for my memory - I forget everything. So I've had B12 deficiency previously (112) but was IF negative so treated me with the 5 injections and retested 6 months later, I was just over the treatment threshold (thinking 186 but cant remember) so they wanted me to wait 12 months to be retested! Anyhow recently exhaustion had got so bad that a couple of weeks ago I went to my GP and said I wasn't happy to wait till December as I really feel like my levels are low again. She agreed the blood test which i had a week ago and today phoned me with the result of 156 - she said they will not give me injections as it's not below 150 and I'm to be retested next January to keep an eye on it. I have a very limited diet due to intolerances and LPR and suffer with upset stomach daily due to IBS so I feel this is the reason why I'm deficient. I'm also on Metformin & Omeprazole which I believe also deplete your levels. I feel like I'm going mad as feel awful and was sure my levels were low. Now I don't know what's causing all my symptoms and am also worried that by January I will definitely be deficient and will gradually feel worse and worse.Just had to vent really as am fed up feeling rubbish."
B12 Deficiency,Help! I just want to feel like myself again! I know this is long.. but PLEASE read : / ,"I'm a 24 year old female who had no medical history or issues until April of this year. In April, I was sitting in a business meeting out of town when suddenly my heart just began racing for no reason. This was quickly accompanied with numbness sensations. Let me just clear up now, this is not a ""pins and needles"" type sensation. The only way I know to decribe it is as if there is no blood circulation. Anways, it started in my feet and lower legs and before I knew it this sensation was running up my arms and finally my face around my mouth. I panicked and quickly exited the meeting where I spent an hour walking around, splashing water on my face - I felt like I was losing my mind. I finally returned to the meeting, never comfortable, and flew back home that evening. I was freeked out, but I attributed this to extreme exhaustion from a busy work week combined with travel and little sleep. Unfortunately, since the moment the sensation came upon me it never fully left. I spent days feeling insane yet maintaining my composure, until the day I broke. I was out for lunch very relaxing day even though I felt bad.All morning I couldn't feel my feet, legs, hands, face, neck, arms, NOTHING. Then, the rapid heartbeat returned. This time it was accompanied with dizziness and this terrible feeling that I couldn't breathe. I truly believed I was dying. I told my boyfriend I had to go to the ER immediately. The ER basically told me I had panic disorder, gave me a klonopin, and told me to see a doctor. I saw a doctor, she immediately drew all sorts of blood and told me my b12 was low. She called me in a few weeks worth of shots and explained that once the shots were done, I wouldn't need anything further. She then insisted that Xanex would fix the real problem. Her explanation: She partially attributed the numbness to being deficeint in B12. The real problem: Anxiety. The ""acute"" numbness sent my anxiety through the roof, this caused my numbness to become worse and also caused the shortness of breath and rapid heart rate. Here I am, six months later. The doctor I was seeing bumped my Xanex all the way up to a total of 1.5 MG Daily. This helped, but not completely. I'm a logical person, and I know there is no way I suddenly developed such severe anxiety that this is what I have to take to feel relatively normal. I HATE XANEX. Fortunately, I am stubborn, and I've continued to take 2500 MCG B12 Vitamins OTC despite my doctors advice (she never rechecked it to see if my levels were in normal range). Yesterday, I finally had enough of popping Benzos all the day long and saw a new doctor. I asked the doctor to please draw blood and test my B12 level and she agreed. I am still awaiting the results. The issue now is that the Doctor saw how much Xanex I'd been prescribed and panicked. Her solution: She cut me down to 0.5 MG QD and gave me no alternative medication. I begged her to the point of tears to be put on something less aggressive to help ween me off and told her I couldn't function day to day without something. So, she prescribed me Propanalol - A MEDICATION FOR HYPERTENSION - Reasoning this would help my rapid heart beat sensations and shortness of breath and Hydroxyzine Pamoate - AN ANTIHISTAMINE - Saying this would help me feel calm. HOW DOES THIS HELP ME WITH NUMBNESS OVER 95% OF MY BODY? Doesn't. This is what brings me here. The doctors I saw never mentioned Pernicious Anemia to me, but a doctor (ophthalmologist) I work closely with did. I looked it up, I took a questionairre - it's all there. I am convinced I have this. And I even read that it is commonly misdiagnosed as anxiety. I've contacted my doctor and left a message with her nurse asking if she would look into this. So now, my question is has anyone out there felt these similar things? If so, how are you coping? I'm also curious to know what dosage/freq of B12 people who are experiencing symptoms as severe as mine are taking. Any feedback is welcomed!

B12 Deficiency,B12 Symptoms,Would anyone agree that the followingis clear B12 symptoms for male over 50?B12 serum result 145ng/L range of 130--800 ng/L Symptoms short term memory .pins and needles hands waking up in the night couple of times a week .Also reading what i think a word is sometimes.And sometimes say the wrong word for what i really meant to say .Tinnitus gradually worse like hissing also like whenyour hearing is when you have a cold too.Over 5 migraine a month Aura only no headache .slight numbness on side of big toe.Just finished B12 Loading dose 6 injections over 2 weeks after GPagreed to it.Will wait until the end of the year for Intrinsic Factor test .GP says would like to give Injections every 3 months.My mother has PA diagnosed very late with neurological symptoms so my concern is i may have a gradualmove towards PA.GP is worried of overdosing me over the B12 range of upper limit of 800ng/L as i requested injection every 2 months but would only agree to this as i am in the range but would agree to every 3 months as i could end up with too much B12 in system.I agree with the GP some of the ideas explained that i am in the just in normal range .But not sure aboutoverdosing on B12 never seen in any evidence in any literature.I am open to the fact i may not have B12 problem leading to PA but from the BCSH GUIDELINES B12 under 200ng/L would be clear marker of adeficientcy.Any suggestions i would be very grateful.
B12 Deficiency,B12 Test 5 minutes after B12 course?,"To sum up; I was given a course of B12 injections for a week, then a blood test to check my B12 levels was taken 5 minutes after the last injection. My GP then called to tell me my B12 levels were 'unusually high', I explained that the test was taken just after the course and after a long silence he replied Yes well the levels are unusually high so you won't need those any more, maybe it is an underlying infection? Thank you.' and then hung up.Four months later I feel terrible, but I don't know how to get them to do another test to check my B12 levels -and- I'm sort of miffed they would suggest it could be an underlying infection but not help me follow that up.- - -I'm 26 years old, I started feeling really awful about 6 years ago. I felt confused, breathing felt hard, my body fely heavy. I would feel extremely full and tired after eating small meals. Mostly I found functioning suddenly became really difficult.I got a lot of blood tests from a lot of different doctors, each time they would ring me up, tell me that my red blood cell levels were 'a bit low but it would be the time of the month', then leave me with that. I'd continue to feel unwell and book again a few months later and get the same.Then nearly 2 years ago the GP I was going to see was away and I was sent through to the nurse practitioner instead, who asked me when my next B12 jabs were due.I'd never heard of this and told her so, she told me with results so low I should have been on them a while ago but as a practitioner she couldn't book the full starting course. I had one jab then, and two more at three month intervals after that. I felt so much better, then I moved houses.For starters it was 2 months before I managed to change my GP , then I was told I needed a course of injections all in one week as I'd never had this, but that they wanted to check by B12 levels themselves. So they booked an injection on monday, Wednesday and Friday and the blood test 5 minutes after the injection on the Friday.The long and short of it is I'm out of the loop now, when I try to get another blood test done I'm told I don't need it, but I feel terrible and rather than getting any sort of solution to this I'm back to square 1.Please can someone give me some advice on where to go from here? Should I try to book privately somehow? (I'm not sure I can afford it)I'm so exhausted, I feel like this is ruining my life but there's nothing I can do about it?"
B12 Deficiency,B12 very low,"I was recently told I had vitamin B12 deficiency. My doctor ran bloods again to double check and also requested tests for Pernicious anemia and celiac disease, both were negative. I asked what my b12 level was and he said zero. He said it was so negligible it didn't register a number.He said that because the tests for PA and celiac came back negative that it was due to dietary reasons. I am not vegan or vegetarian and eat a varied diet so I'm sceptical that it's because of diet. He's given me 150mcg of cynocolbalmin tablets to take daily for the next 6 months and then have bloods redone to check levels. I just wondered if anyone had any opinions on whether that sounds like the best course of action? From what I've read, with very low levels, people generally get injections to get their levels back up.Advice appreciated ?"
B12 Deficiency,Feeling very poorly,"Hello, I'm hoping someone here can give me some advice. I have been feeling unwell for a number of months (approx 4 months). Nothing you could specifically put your finger on, but increased fatigue and a general feeling of not feeling ""well"".A couple of months ago I had a hospital admission with ""suspected"" viral meningitis. I had an excruciating headache, severe vomiting, delirium, pains in my legs & feeling hot and cold at the same time (?chills I guess) and low grade fever. I went to my doctor approx two weeks ago & she ordered bloods (a very wide variety apparently, including thyroid). I had my bloods done and a few days later my doctors surgery phoned & asked me to come in for some more blood tests, this time for B12 and folate, as apparently something was off on my FBC. Anyway, I am really in a sorry state.. I'm feeling so unwell! Pains in my legs, weakness, dizziness, can't sleep, feeling hot and cold, breathlessness when moving around, feeling confused on and off. It's taken me ages to write this! I'm desperate.. I see the GP next week for the test results. But I don't know if I can go on like this!!!

I'm 35 and have 2children (7 year old and 11 month old). I eat well and do dance twice a week. I'm not overweight, maybe slightly underweight.

I'm thinking I might get some b12 spray or dissolving tablets, or patches? And maybe take folate and iron tablets too? I've also been looking into whether to buy t3 tablets for my thyroid to see if that helps? Thank you in you are still reading, if you can offer any advice I'd really appreciate it.

B12 Deficiency,Newly Diagnosed PA,"Good evening,I have recently been diagnosed with PA after 15 years of being advised that my symptoms were due to my underactive thyroid!I had my loading dose 1 week ago, however I still have numbness in my feet and the fingers on my right hand, can anyone please advise if they have had these symptoms and if I should expect them to subside it if I should revisit my GP.I am a healthy and fit 30 year old so my b12 deficiency has come as a surprise as the doctored have advised me that I am extremely young to have PA and therefore they expect I was born with PA.My symptoms have subsided somewhat, i.e painful bones and lack of concentration, however I am rather concerned about my numb feet as I know this is neurological. I would appreciate it if anyone can give me any sort of advice on any steps I can take to try regain proper feeling in my feet or any advice in general that will a able me to regain my alertness and stamina.Thank youLeo "

B12 Deficiency,Is it B12 deficiency ? lost ,"I v been suffering from weird symptoms for 10 months, and I am lost, i still dont know what is causing them. -Feeling drunk-Imbalance-weak hands and legs-Short memory loss -Confusion -Anxiety -Tingling -double vision -I have a wound on the corner of my mouth that won't heal for months (I don't know I'd it s related)I had a CT scan, blood test but nothing, I went to an ENT he noticed a general Imbalance but couldnt explain it, my dentist told me that I have TMJ and that I could cause my symptoms so I wear a month guard since 3 months, a neurologist didn't even listened, he just gave me meds for migraine but it didn't help.. My symptoms keep worsening and I just came across B12 deficiency and it fits so well so I asked for a b12 test and folate even if my GP was sure it wasn't this, I had to insist. And I have tingling on both sides of body but it s worse on the left side.. What are your opinions ? Could it be B12 deficiency ? And i m afraid that the test might look normal but I heard that it can be not precise.. I m 17 and i live in Belgium, English is not my native language sorry for the errors my GP also told me that I have Crohn disease a year ago but he didn't tell me much about it.

B12 Deficiency,B12 still below 600 after 6 weekly shots.,"I have been feeling ill for a few years now. My doctors thought I possibly had MS because of my symptoms, but after many tests, have come up with nothing. They tested my B12 and it came back at about 200, so in the normal range(?). My neurologist decided I should start getting weekly B12 shots to see if that helps. It has helped some. I have gotten some of my strength back, but I still am having a hard time with my balance and stamina. I still have a hard time using my hands and walking. My last blood test showed that, after 6 shots my B12 level is still under 600. My doctor was confused by this and said that she would have expected my level to be above 1000 by now. While doing my own research I came across pernicious anemia and asked her if I had been tested for it. She said I had been tested for general anemia and it had com back negative. Is the test for pernicious anemia different? Is it possible to have it even if the general test came back negative?"
B12 Deficiency,"Diagnosed at 25 with pernicious anemia, early neuropathy, and necrobiosis lipoidica??","At 21, I noticed two spots on my legs that appeared similar to ring worm. After many creams and ointments with no improvement, I finally went to a dermatologist who diagnosed me with necrobiosis lipoidica and told me once I got my diabetes under control, the spots would go away. Meanwhile the doctor kept commenting on how odd it was that I had this so young as it is only typically seen in elderly women who and is usually a key identifier for their late diabetes. Confused and upset, I went to my primary doctor to confirm that I was diabetic and begin treatment. However, the only symptoms of diabetes I experienced was extreme fatigue (in spite of all the different antidepressants my doctors had put me on for years....I was currently taking 3 kinds daily and still exhausted) and tingling/loss of sensation. I also was experiencing quite a bit of short term memory loss, but it was always said to be from my depression according to doctors. After many blood tests and doctor changes, it was concluded many times over that I was not diabetic. I was just one of the extremely rare cases of the skin disorder without diabetes and especially being so young. However, through all of this my fatigue kept getting worse and worse. Finally my doctor sent me to a neurologist thinking that perhaps I was narcoleptic. However, after nerve tests and brain scan, my neurologist that even though I was now 23, my brain scan confirmed I was not narcoleptic, but had early neuropathy. He immediately ordered blood tests that confirmed I was both deficient in D and B vitamins. My primary doctor then diagnosed me with pernicious anemia and I have been on b12 injections ever since. However, as my super rare skin disorder still progresses, spreading even with steroid injections, I find it hard to believe that as these conditions all typically occur mainly in women much older than me (20-40 years at least) that there isn't some relation, done unknown root cause not discovered by my doctors yet. Has anyone else been diagnosed with both necrobiosis lipoidica and pernicious anemia? Has anyone else ever been diagnosed so young with either? Confused and frustrated, I would greatly appreciate any insight."

B12 Deficiency,Possible B12 deficiency,"Hi guys,I am just looking for some confirmation, could I have B12 deficiency? This winter I became very ill. I was not sleeping at all, felt anxious all the time, and the worst part was this - sort of - humming in my ear. My doc put me on anti-anxiety drugs and I did begin to feel better. I still feel really tired though and - at times - also a bit depressed. Sometimes my tongue seems to swell and it's like it doesn't fit my mouth. I also recognise the ataxia and afasia symptoms to a certain degree. Since I was so depressed, and this wasn't the first time, I recently also had testing done and discovered that I have a common mutation that is called MTRR and reduces my capacity to make active B12.Would it be wise to test for B12 deficiency? I would love to test my active B12, but I am not sure I can convince my doc to do this. I do think this is the only way to find out if I have enough active B12. I had testing done before. My value in 2012 was 330 pmol/l.I would love to hear your suggestions."
B12 Deficiency,Pernicious anemia. ,Hi all. I have been having B12 injections and taking folate for more than 10/12years. Injection every 3months and 1folate tab every day. 2weeks and 2weeks after my injection I have felt like I was hit by a train. After I could run a marathon as I am 52 but generally active. The last 2 months I have had none stop fuzzy headachs pins and needles in my hands face and feet. Worse in the morning. My fingers are stiff and hert when I bend them. Can anyone show some light on possible cause of this problem. Or as anyone had same discomfort. Many thanks. A
B12 Deficiency,Different opinions,"I had blood tests to check b12 and iron. My doctor rang with the results and said I need 6 loading injections and iron tablets. I made the other 5 appointments as I'd already had one injection last week. I had an phone appointment today to talk because I had some questions because immediately after the b12 injection my heart was pounding, I felt faint and sick. Over the weekend all I've done is sleep and I felt like I had pain in my bones?! I was wondering if this was a normal reaction so rang doctor.The dr I spoke with told me not to have the loading dose because there's nothing wrong with me according to the last blood test.When I had my first b12 injection I had a blood test immediately after. Could having the b12 first have confused the results or should I get a 3rd opinion?"
B12 Deficiency,Are the B12 supplements making me tired?,Hi. I was told last week that my B12 levels were at 150 but I tested negative for pernicious anemia. My doctor said it was because of the gastritis that I have been suffering from for months that has caused a drop in B12.I have been prescribed oral supplements of B12 and folic acid to take for a few months. I started taking these on Tuesday and since then I have been EXHAUSTED!! I never sleep during the day but that's all I have been doing this week. Now that my gastritis is settling I was hoping to get back into fitness but I'm just too tired! Even more tired than before the supplements!Are these linked or is it just a coincidence? Thanks.Hi.

B12 Deficiency,Possible B12 Deficiency...sound similar?,"Just looking to see if anyone has experienced these same symptoms. Been chasing my aches pains and podd health phenomenoms for years now and seem to be getting closer. While I await test results, was wondering if this sounds familiar to anyone here.My problems could have started a long time ago, with the onset of some early symptoms and just gotten worse. That is what I suspect as NONE of my symptoms have ever resolved themselves from the first moment that I got them. Just new ones appeared along the way. Its possioble that my early symptoms were related to some other illness that progressed into b12 deficiency so its hard to say. But here goes.Early life I was extremely thin (truly sickly thin)...very late puberty and lactose intolerant with very pale skin. Started going grey at age 20 and was 50-50 by 30. Always had night blindness and difficulty adjusting from light to dark and vice versa.Went through bouts of serious asthma for about 5 years with lots of Migraines, allergies, weird infections etc.The weird things started about 10 years ago at age 40 when I began to notice edema in both my legs (specifically on the bone in front of my calves). It would indent and not come back to normal for hours. Always noticeable and real bad at times. Drs shrugged it off as eating too much salt.CK levels started to show up as dangerously elevated along with high cholesterol. (started taking statins). Dr blamed diet.Blood pressure started to climb (mostly just the lower number was a concern.)about 8 years ago, woke up one morning with a dime size glossy spoy on tongue. Dr confirmed as glossitis and have had it continually ever since. Constantl changing, always there though.About 7 years ago, CK levels start showing elevated. Not real high but over ""normal"". Dr sends me to neurologist to rule out MD. 5 years ago, I starte getting tiny faciculations/twitches in calves. Dr sends me to neuro to have EMG done (normal). About the same time I start with tinnitus (pretty bad). Always had trouble hearing in any room with any background noise. Specialists say I have some hearing loss but that I will get used to the Tinnitus eventually (which I have, but always there and really bad at times).Vision which was perfect all my sight suddenly goes down the drain. First close up then distance as well. Need tons of light to read anything. Night blindness is far worse now. Cant hardly read the word shampoo on a shampoo bottle now without glasses. very blurry. Drs find retina degradation and spotting/greying on my retina...after numerous tests, cannot explain...just monitoring it.the minor twitches in calves are now MUCH more noticeable and now scattered through my body randomly. No longer have to see them, I can feel them everywhere from arms, chest, butt, abdomen...just random firings and feel them constantly. Tingling begins in extremities, like vibrations in toes and fingers.Start getting Raynauds symptoms...fingers are now turning blue in even te slightest exposure to cold. White to blue to red in a matter of minutes...VERY painful when I come back in for relief....takes about 10 minutes to go away but feel inflamed for hours afterward.about 3 years ago I start getting crazy fatigue. Tired just carrying even 3 or 4 lbs for more than a minute. Shoulders, butt, thighs get tired just walking up steps. Have to stop and catch breath and relive muscle pai. Also start to become almost narcoleptic while driving (just glaze over) but especially any time after 5PM. Complete exhaustion and have to sleep for 1/2 hour or more to come out of it. Difficulty raising arms over head form more than a few seconds.Along the way my gassiness and bloating have gotten worse (still thin but have a bloated belly)Then the mental fog began. Cant stay with conversations, lose my sense of humour and social skills as I prefer not to talk as much. Became more short tempered around others. One bout of what I can only say must have been anxiety/ paranois/depression for about 3 months (that is the only possible ""symptom"" that actually went away).started reading about B12 deficiency and celiacs and started wondering if I may have an absorption issue. being tested currently but awaiting results (endoscope visual indicates H.Pylori bacteria in stomach but awaiting biopsy results).About 2 weeks ago I decided to start taking a liquid sublingual B-12 supplement (megadose) thinking I may have an absorption issue. Within a week, the twitches are gone. (only the tiny ones in the calves are there that have been there for years before it spread). But all other twitches are completely gone.Went to Drs yesterday to have b12 measured but I may have screwed things up by trying to treat before tesing (but in my defense, I probably would not have been tested if I had not seen an improvement so sort of a catch 22).If this is B12 deficiency syndrome then I probably have a long way to go before things get back to normal and if (as I suspect) Ive had this for years, is it possibel that not everytjing will go back to normal. I do have more energy and less fatigue (but that may have coincided with a recent diet change eliminating alot of fat, sugars and reduced salt and breads)So anyone here have these types of symptoms with B-12 deficiency? "
B12 Deficiency,My P.A. Story,"Although my P.A. journey started ""officially"" on 10th May 1972 events from 13 years before may well have been the true beginning.Around Christmas time in 1958 I started to get ""indigestion"" pains in my left chest area and these got progressively worse until the Tuesday morning of 28th April 1959 when my (then unknown about) peptic ulcer perforated and I vomited blood at work. I was taken to the Birmingham General Hospital and sent home with a letter to my doctor. On the Thursday, because I was still losing blood I was rushed to the Dudley Road Hospital, placed in a medical ward and given transfusions and Horlicks tablets. At visiting time on Sunday 3rd May I filled a kidney bowl with blood in front of my father and sister. The surgeon (Mr Aldridge) was called and he operated that afternoon removing two thirds of my stomach.I was 17 years old and the only advice I can remember being given by the surgeon was that I would have to give up my electrical apprenticeship and ""find a sedentary job"". Being an otherwise relatively fit and healthy 17-year-old I ignored Mr Aldridge’s advice, completed my apprenticeship and qualified in 1962. It was around this time that I began feeling more tired, was getting ill more often with colds and bronchitis and so took an opportunity which presented itself of an indoor job with an electrical wholesaler as a storeman/buyer which did not entail the same amount of physical work.In September 1965 I married my 19 year old wife Valerie but shortly after Christmas she began to complain of feeling tired and listless so I got an appointment for her to see a doctor on 14th January 1966 at what was to become our family’s practice in Aylesbury. After innumerable blood tests Valerie was rushed into Stoke Mandeville Hospital suffering sub acute bacterial endocarditis possibly caused by her having had rheumatic fever some years before. She was in hospital on that first occasion for five weeks in S.M.H. before being transferred to The Churchill Hospital in Oxford for weeks for further tests.The effects of that long separation, together with the worry of what was going on with her were to have a profound impact on me. My life, my whole world had been turned upside down and on 6th April 1966 I came home from work with ‘flu, our doctor (Wool) came round and signed me off work for a week.Now and for the next few weeks, it was my turn to see the doctor. On 20th April, Valerie entered into her diary, Saw Doctor. Valerie & Clive. Clive’s complaint Hypertension owing to worry about me"". I was signed off for another week. The flu (if that is what it was) had been just about the ""last straw"" to my already struggling mental and physical condition and had dragged me down to a very low ebb. On Wednesday, 27th April 1966, Valerie noted that I had yet another appointment with Doctor Wool at the surgery. By now I was getting a bit worried about what was going to happen with me, as this was already my third week off work and more especially when I was signed off for a fourth week. On 11th May I received a letter from my employer saying they ""were sorry I had been ill for several weeks"" and gave me one week’s notice of termination.I managed to get a job with a local builder nominally as a labourer who could do any electrical work needed and somehow managed to cope with the physical work involved. Sadly early in 1968 the builder ""reluctantly"" had to let me go, as he didn’t have enough work on hand to continue employing me. Indeed I was not to work again for over two years, until February 1970.The psychological effect of being made redundant again, combined with the deterioration in my general health and specifically with regard to my (then unknown) pernicious anaemia, was devastating. Once the initial shock of having to go home and tell Valerie that I was once again ""out of work"" had worn off, I was left feeling totally deflated, useless, unwanted, - a complete and utter failure.That unemployment around the country was running at an all time high didn’t help me much and I rapidly fell into a morose depression from which Valerie, although she tried her hardest, failed to lift me, however she did eventually persuade me to go to ""see the doctor"". As a result of her examination, Doctor Wool diagnosed ""depression"", immediately signed me off ""work"" indefinitely and prescribed the then, in vogue and rapidly becoming ubiquitous tranquilliser Valium, which, over time and in the course of the next few months, was joined by two others, Librium and Tofranil. My tummy was playing up too and Dr Wool prescribed ""Neutradonna"", a huge, anti-spasmodic tablet, containing belladonna (deadly nightshade). It was a good job that prescriptions were free then, as Valerie and I almost rattled with the number we were taking.At some time during the summer of 1968 I was sent for a ""Schillings"" test where I drank a glass of radioactive vitamin b12 and given a massive injection of b12 into my arm. My urine was collected over a period of time and measured for the amount of radioactive b12 passed but as the results were ""inconclusive"" I heard no more about it.Being ""signed off work"" for such a long time meant I had to undergo an ""assessment"" of fitness or otherwise to return to work and I was eventually sent on a five month long Government retraining course in Accountancy in London. This started in September 1969 and ran through to February 1970. I had by then ""weaned"" myself off the tranquillisers and managed to not only complete the course but also to get a job as book-keeper for a large firm in my home town, starting the following week.The spur and incentive that had dragged me off the drugs and got me through college and ""back to work again"", two years earlier, gradually wore off and by 1972 I was starting to feel physically very tired and mentally exhausted. Some of it could be put down to learning the job with a grim determination to succeed that, for me, was really quite remarkable, but the rest was attributed to the ongoing, general decline in my health.I had still been a regular visitor to Dr Wool’s surgery (now located in Oakfield Road) for more tests, none of which indicated the source of the problem and so she played a hunch and sent me for another ""Schillings Test"". So, sometime during the Spring of 1972 I duly presented myself at Stoke Mandeville Hospital for another ""radio active"" drink and large ""sample"" container. The man who administered the test remembered me from four years before and told me quite categorically that ""no-one has a Schillings Test done twice"". I said ""I do"" and I did!The day in May 1972 that I went back to Dr Wool for the results is etched indelibly into my memory.It was on the Wednesday afternoon of 10th May that I duly presented myself at the surgery and Dr Wool greeted me with the words ""Do you want the good news – or the bad news?"" I said that perhaps she ought to give me the ""bad news"" first.She replied ""The bad news is, that you’re going to die – and you’re going to die within the next three years"".Naturally I was somewhat rather keen to know what the ""good news"" was. So I asked Dr Wool what the ""good news"" was.She said, with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes, ""The good news is you’re not going to die within three years if you have regular injections (of vitamin B12) from now, for the rest of your life.""To the relief of both of us (as I think Dr Wool was getting a bit frustrated with my long, ongoing ""condition"" too) the second Schillings Test had showed that I was suffering from Pernicious Anaemia and I was to have Cytamen (cyanocobalamin) injections every four weeks from then on.Down through the next 38 years I was never monitored or asked by either doctors or nurses how I was coping with my P.A. However I was beginning to notice that in the run up to my next injection I was beginning to have some of the symptoms associated with it – pins & needles, burning legs/feet, shooting pains in hands, numbness, breathlessness, tinnitus, loss of balance, back pains, fog days etc.On Friday 16th April 2010 I joined the Pernicious Anaemia Society and posted the following: ""I was diagnosed with PA back in 1972 consequent upon having had surgery for a peptic ulcer in April 1959 at the tender age of 17. In those days I was not many years from having to be put on a diet of raw liver - 3 times a day!!! Thank goodness for Cytamen 1000 mcg...... So, for nigh on 40 years I have ""got by"" with my 4 weekly injections - my ""little shots of Red-Ex"" as I call them. However when I complain to my GP that in the run up to the next jab I start to feel symptoms returning… he simply laughs, telling me (essentially) that it's ""all in the mind"" and that the dosage will last for a month. How can this be? This ""one size fits all"" syndrome that doesn't take into account size, (I'm 6'4"" @ 13.5 stones) age, activity or metabolism. I cannot believe that I am the only person with PA who experiences this feeling of exhaustion in the run up to the next shot - or am I?""I was astounded at how many ""fellow sufferers"" there were ""out there"" who experienced the same thing and so for the last six years I’ve been learning more about the condition.In summary then:On page 56 of ""Could it be B12"" (Sally M. Pacholok R.N., B.S.N. & Jeffrey J. Stuart, D.O.) a case is recorded part of which reads ""… He (the doctor)wasn’t surprised: The woman’s history included a gastrectomy twelve years earlier that inevitably results in severe B12 deficiency if patients don’t receive compensatory B12 injections"". Should I have not been warned of this back in 1959 after my gastric surgery and given B12 injections instead of just being advised to ""get a sedentary job""The worries about my young wife’s illness in 1966 and the loss of jobs would be reason enough cause for me to have had ""hypertension"" but it was not until early 1968 that I was diagnosed with ""depression"" and put on Librium, Valium, (anxiety & panic attacks) Tofranil (depression) and Neutradonna (anti-spasmodic). It was not uncommon for B12 deficiency to be misdiagnosed as depression so my G.P. was probably ""right"" prescribing the above, this being borne out by the ""inconclusive"" first Schillings test. That she ""played a hunch"" and sent me for the second, ""unheard of"" Schillings test four years later probably saved my life and certainly spared me having many of the irreversible neurological P.A. symptoms, so I shall ever be grateful to her for that.My latest B12 and Folate test results (14th March 2016) are as follows:Serum Folate (SZ1706) Normal no action 18.2 ng/ml 3.10 – 20.50ng/mlVITAMIN B12 (SZ1706) Normal no action 469 pg/ml 187.00 – 883.00pg/mlB12 Comment - B12 in normal rangeOn 25th March 2016 I took a heavy fall whilst walking along a public footpath, badly damaging my right hand, wrist and knee. I’m sure my general unsteadiness and awkward gait contributed to this fall and I feel it is worth noting that this occurred just three days before my next scheduled B12 injection.I was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes this time last year and with low Vitamin D in March this year, the symptoms of both of which ""cloud"" the issue because of their similarities. In addition of course there is my age at coming up to 75, that has to be taken into consideration.When shortly after the diabetes diagnosis in 2015 I had my first (ever) ""eye test"" it was found that there was already damage to the retina in my left eye. This may well have been caused more by the P.A. than the diabetes as I remember Dr. Wool saying back in 1972 that my eyes would be ""checked"" – they never were.My current doctor acknowledges the fact that, because I have the injections, the above ""Normal"" B12 results may be ""skewed"", because of my neuropathy symptoms she has agreed to increase the frequency of my cyanocobalamin B12 injections from every four weeks to every three weeks from July 2016.There is life after P.A. and I'm still ""Clivealive"" aged 75"
B12 Deficiency,Borderline low B12 - could that cause my symptoms?,"I am a 50-year-old female who has been overall very healthy throughout my life. 7 weeks ago, I suddenly began having pins and needles in both feet - they wouldn't go so far as to ""fall asleep,"" but just the general tingling, pins and needles feeling. Very soon that progressed to also include my lower, and upper legs. Every day for the past 7 weeks I've had this - it never goes away, though during stretches I might not notice it as much, or it might be more severe at one moment than another. Also, the sensations can't be described as just one type - they change/rotate/sometimes several types occur at once, and include tingling (including on soles of feet), pins and needles, a sharp pain in one big toe, a slight burning feeling, a very slight buzzing feeling (nothing drastic), prickly legs, and the phantom-like feeling that something's brushing against the inside of my upper things (on top of the skin) - almost feels like static. Generally there's no pain, except for that occasional stab in my toe. I've had a couple areas very fleetingly feel numb, but so far that hasn't progressed to any true numbness where I can't feel touch, or anything like that. At times I've felt my hands might be starting to tingle - HOWEVER, that hasn't really materialized and that could by my extra-sensitive imagination, and expectation it will occur there next. I don't feel like I have weakness - more like tired legs. But NOT so tired that it keeps me from doing normal stuff. Through all this I've continued to work (getting in and out of my car, walking short distances several times a day), drive around a lot, move around the house going up and down stairs, doing laundry, preparing meals, all the normal things of life. No trouble with walking or balance. Also, curiously (but thank goodness) these sensations don't bother me during the night and I'm able to get decent sleep. Anyway - sorry for all the detail. 2-3 weeks ago my doctor checked my B12 and found my level to be 275. She acknowledges this can be considered low, even though it's supposedly just above the ""normal"" range. This is my question - has anyone experienced what I've experienced? And could these sypmtoms of mine be caused by B12 deficiency, even if it's not ""drastically"" low? By the way I haven't had my B12 checked for decades, if ever, so I can't say whether it's been this level for a long time, or what's the case with that.I've started 7500-10,000 micrigrams sublingual B12 and feel no improvement, but that's just been for a couple weeks. I'm assuming it's normal it could take longer to see a change in symptoms.Of course, I'm freaked out about MS - but for this post, I'm just focusing on whether my B12 could indeed be the cause of all this trouble. Currently I'm waiting for further blood work that's testing folate and MMA to get a better idea of B12 issues, as well as glucose for diabetes (though a few months ago that was normal in a routine check). I'm hoping so badly this IS B12 to blame, since I can certainly live with that and do everything possible to reverse it. But I'm just looking for people's opinions or personal experiences on whether fairly low B12 can actually cause such weird, disturbing sensations. One more thing, for the past 18-24 months I've had occasional aching hips/legs overnight - I maybe notice it a few times a week. I've always attributed this to aging joints, peri-menopause, bursitis that goes with getting older, maybe some early arthritis, etc... But now I'm reading this could also be a sign of B12 deficiency - has anyone else experienced this, where your hips/legs are painful at night, but basically fine during the day (although they're a little stiff when I first get up in the morning)? Sorry, I feel like I'm all over the place here. If anyone has actually read to the end of this - I would so appreciate any feedback on B12 and anything else I've touched on.Thank you so very much!"
B12 Deficiency,B12 Injection Side Effects,"Hi All,I have recently been diagnosed with B12 deficiency and commenced my loading dose injections yesterday. After 9 months of feeling completely not myself, test for all sorts of different things plus fighting the "" your symptoms are anxiety"" card I was finally diagnosed with Coelliac disease and the the B12.My symptoms are headaches, sensitive eyes, strange smells, metalic taste in my mouth, severe neck ache, a hard to discribe numb feeling in my chest, pins and needs in my hands (mainly left) numbness in my 4th toe (also left sided), weak heavy leg feeling like I'm about to faint,difficulty stringing a sentance together, forgetting memorable words, losing track of what I'm saying mid conversation, clumsy hands and poor spacial awareness (always hiting my hands on things) cold hands and feet, dizziness and ppor balance...the list goes on..I had my first B12 jab yesterday and today I am feeling terrible. I feel dizzy, sick, really cold hands, numbness in my hands and a very spaced out almost migrainey type feeling. I can't concentrate and keep forgetting what I am talking about. Basically by pervious B12 deifciency symptoms just mych more intense. I'm currently struggling through a day at work and could really do with some peice of mind that this is normal and other people have felt like this?I'm hoping it wears off soon and I dont experience it every time after my next 5 injections Thank you for any comments Jen"
B12 Deficiency,what is low for b12,"hi, i was a semi vegetarian for 2 years then became unwell, had vitamin b12 checked it was 220, i started eating meat and was having cereal fortified with b12 it then rose to 287 in 7 months, i had a new test done 2 months later and it is down to 252 again, does this mean anything as i have continued eating meat, should my level be higher now i am comsuming more meat, thanks i also have ulcerative colitis but dont know if science says it causes malabsobtion thanks for any help x"
B12 Deficiency,4 years of dizziness and vitamin B12 is 290,"Hi all,Hi all, I have had low ferritin for five years (that's another story) but recently asked my GP if she would test my B12 too as this has never been done and I know the symptoms of anaemia are similar to deficient b12. Reluctantly she agreed! My test came back and I was told it was normal. I have had dizziness, fatigue, blurred vision, poor night vision, brain fog and depression now for five years. My ferritin was as low as 5 at one point and my GP still wouldn't refer me for IV iron or injections.Something told me to ring up and ask for my actual b12 result and I was told it was 290. I realise this is on the scale but from what I have read I believe it is low. Given that my symptoms have been with me so long now and I have reached a real low point I am considering asking my GP for injections. I know she will probably say no, she makes me feel like I'm a total moron and like I am going mad. She just says I'm on the scale so shouldn't worry. But I can't not worry, I feel ill every day, some days I can't get up, I can't drive anymore because of the dizziness and I'm just so miserable. I just want to feel better. I'm getting married in September and can't even contemplate it right now feeling this way. I don't even have the energy to plan. :-(Am I justified asking my GP for injections? Did anyone else have a battle getting these? If so, what did people say to get their GP to agree? Does anyone know if injections can be obtained privately?

B12 Deficiency,Rapid B12 depletion,"Hi,I was diagnosed with pernicious anemia in December & have been recieving injections since! My question is... Does anyone have a clue why my B12 levels are dropping so rapidly?Thank you for any responses."
B12 Deficiency,B12 injections not working?,"I have recently been diagnosed as having a b12 deficiency I was told that I was very low and need injections once every fortnight. I have had three injections, one every fortnight and got my test results back for my blood test after these and my levels had not changed one bit, I was just wondering if this is a normal thing. I have since been having them once weekly and have had three more shots and will be getting my blood test back again soon but I was just wondering if having injections nd the levels not changing, if that's normal.

B12 Deficiency,Lifestyle changes with a B12 deficiency ,I posted on here a month or so ago with questions relating to my very new diagnosis. I had all my 6 loading sessions finishing maybe 2 weeks ago and I'm not sure how else I can support myself in the mean time.The whole reason the B12 was discovered was due to my debilitating and excruciating pain in my upper abdomen (which feels very much like an ulcer). The pain is still carrying on regardless of the loading shots and I'm seeing a gastroenterologist next week for more tests.I feel woefully underinformed and don't know if I should be taking b12 or folic acid (I'm not even sure what that is or how it would help!). Or whether I need a certain diet as a B12 deficient person. Or how I might relate to my stomach pains in the knowledge that I have this deficiency.Any help would be very welcome as I'm getting quite desperate now!!ThanksD
B12 Deficiency,Recently Diagnosed Severs B12 Deficiency.,"I have just been diagonosed with B12 deficincy my B12 Level was 52 when I was hospitalised after losing the abilty to walk. I am BEYOND tired. My legs are numb and tingling my hands and arms are the same. I cant stand or walk due to balance issues. I have undergone testing and the sensory nevres in my arms and legs are not working. I have lost 19kg in 4 months, My hair is falling out in clumps, my vision is blurry, I cant think, I forget stuff all the time, Ive been getting heart palpatations, My muscles are wasting away. I cant even feel if I need to go to the toilet. Nothing is working and infact its gettig worse since leaving the hospital I have lost the sense of tast and my face is now also numb.They gave me three doses in hospital of 800mcg B12 injections. Then they sent me home. Ive had three shots since but its not working. Now they reckon I dont need one for another 3 months. My doctor has said Im the first paitent he has seen with such a bad deficiency. Im not sure he is doing the right thing. They decided I wouldnt need one for three months BEFORE getting another blood test.Does anyone know the BEST treatment plan. The longer my levels are stupidly low the the more chance this nerve damage will be permanent.I feel I may have to research this and educate my GP.Any info, reading videos you could suggest would be great.

B12 Deficiency,B12 deficiency - reaction to B12 injections???,"Hi, in the past few weeks I have been diagnosed with B12 deficiency anaemia. Some of my results are:Iron - 9 (ok level: 12)Folate - 4 (ok level 4-8 i think; my GP says this result was fine)B12 - 118 ('normal' level 200-900)These are from an English GP. I have been tested for coeliac disease (blood test was negative) and awaiting PA antibodies result. I have been referred for Crohn's.I have started on B12 injections - 6 every other day or so. I have had 4. After injection 2 and 4 I have woken up the following day with intense pain across my lower chest/upper abdominal area; such pain that I can hardly move around, accompanied by nausea and a hot, itchy, red blotchy rash on my face and little raised lumps along the underside of my forearms.As my B12 level is so low, I am keen to finish this course of injections. But do you have any idea whether these are side effects or an allergy. I have read through literature about side effects, I think that's what they are but are they serious ones and mean I should stop? I see a different nurse each time for my B1If I am taken off B12 injections, how on earth do I improve my B12 level? I am not a veggie/vegan and eat plenty of B12; I have bowel/digestive issues that we think are leading to malabsorption.I am mid-30s and have had bowel problems and fatigue all of my life, more recently I have had tingly and painful feet, dizziness, migraines and possibly signs of memory impairment.

B12 Deficiency,2 Nurses overrule 2 Doctors,"Wonder if someone can help.I had a blood test 2 weeks ago that threw up a B12 deficiency. The level showed well below the normal levels, and was 107The first Doctor rang me about it and told me i had to start a course of 6 injections, plus take folic acid.Rang my own Doctor, and she confirmed i would need the 6, loading dose. I asked could it be the Lanzaprazole I was taking, she said no.I went for first injection last Friday, and 2 nurses were present, one of them lead nurse, and they asked me some symptoms, the proceeded to give me first injection, telling me to make appts every two days until i had the 6.2nd injection, same nurse, no lead nurse, and everything fine.3rd injection today, different nurse, no lead nurse. This nurse tells me i dont need loading dose, as it had only shown low level once (that makes difference?)i queried it as 2 docs and 2 nurses had said i need loading dose.Nurse calls in same lead nurse that was there on first injection, and she tells me, no loading dose, come back in 3 months, but we will give you todays injection. Its protocol, to do this, is what she says.i queried the fact that she had not said anything at first injection, and that not one but two doctors had said i need loading dose.Its protocol is all she said, so i wont get any more injections for 3 months.i know that I have had lots of symptoms, although didnt know why at the time.Now I am totally confused, and worried, and dont know how 2 nurses can over ride what 2 docotors have said.Please help, if anyone can give me some insight"
B12 Deficiency,Was my pernicious anaemia wrongly diagnosed?,"Was diagnosed having pernicous anaemia in 2011 after feeling terrible for months. Was so relived that the B12 injections made me feel normal again. I had one every 12 weeks, then 6 months ago went to every 10. I don't get the same benefits from them anymore.my doctor retired, I have a new one now.I had a general appointment a few weeks ago and thought it worth mentioning that I didn't feel as good on the injections as I used to . He looked at all my blood results - "" you haven't got pernicous anaemia"" he told me. He gave me an explanation , which when I've looked online makes sense.I am now a little scared?... What can a wrong diagnosis mask?? My B12 was 115 originally. And I did feel so ill and tired... I was checked then for any thyroid problems which came back negative.Going back to the doctors today now I've got over the shock. I know he wants me to go for lots of blood tests... "
B12 Deficiency,Vitamin b12 injections,Why does my health board say that vitamin b12 injections can only be given once every three months
B12 Deficiency,Could it be PA?,"I'm going to the doctors on Monday after a week of some funny symptoms.First of all, I have a pretty awful diet - I know this! I have a demanding job and if it were up to me, would probably live on toast and carbs. I don't eat a great deal of meat as I'm not overly keen on it. Hence, for some time now I've gotten every bad cold going!My last bad cold, I took Sudafed and noticed that I had a weird foggy-brain feeling, so I stopped taking it (this was about 2 weeks ago) but then pins and needles started. I had it one night in my left hand and then my right foot. It would last for about 20 minutes before seemingly moving to a different part of my body. The next day, I had little sort of involuntary movements (not noticeable to anyone but me). For example, I'd text someone and my finger would slip to the wrong letter on the screen. The pins and needles then came back but it was sort of weird short bursts of tingles...on the tip of my nose, the top of my left thumb, my right foot...even had an itchy toe. Taking an anti-histamine seemed to calm it down and when I started taking a good multi vit, plus a boost of magnesium, the brain fog certainly seemed to lift considerably.Last night though, I had two glasses of wine before bed and it felt like my body was alive with ants crawling all over it...it was so weird! I went to bed and woke up at 2am with pins and needles in left hand and right leg and a heart beating madly at nearly 90bpm. I got up and sat quietly in a chair - the pins and needles eventually stopped and heart rate seemed to go back to normal about 30 mins later.Other symptoms I've had over the past few years; I'm known for my whining about the cold! I'm always cold! I also (of late) have had a few episodes of shoulder bumping where I seem to walk into a door frame! I've also felt a bit dizzy, a bit nauseous and lacking in appetite (despite knowing that I should be feeling hungry!). I sometimes struggle to remember the right word for things too. Nothing serious but it's like the word for something is on the tip of my tongue but it takes a few seconds to suddenly grab it again. Turns out we have a family history of hyperthyroidism, Graves and PA. I also read that PA can be linked to negative blood types...I'm a fairly rare A rh -.I've no signs of muscle weakness and taking a double dose of B12 this morning seems to have cleared brain fog a wee bit more! But my left hand is a bit tingly and I still feel a bit twitchy."
B12 Deficiency,B12 deficiency - how to know diet/malabsorption? new diagnosis.,"Hi allThis is my first post as I was recently diagnosed as B12 deficient. My symptoms included gastro, psychological and fatigue so - from reading some threads - it seems I could have been deficient for a while.I'm a bit confused though as I'm not sure how doctors work out if you have a diet based deficiency or a malabsorption problem. I guess I'm trying to work it out as I understand the second is treated for life and I wondered how they knew I was in that category.I had my first shot yesterday and was fine but when I woke today I had terrible flu like weakness, heaviness, balance problems. I'm being tested for other gastro problems and wondered if I am positive for another condition will I still need the b12 shots if the underlying cause is fixed?I didn't get much info at the doctors so please forgive me with what might seem silly questions.Thanks everyone!

B12 Deficiency,"Please help, severe vitamin b12 defiency, onset of dementia","Hi everyone, I'm 23 years old. For about a year now I have suffered from symptoms of severe vitamin b12 deficiency. For the past year I have been unable to treat it because I didn't know what it was. But now I am so scared because I think I started to get dementia. I have had memory problems and cognitive problems for 3 years now, but these past three months it has really progressed into something i can't control. Most importantly, I feel myself getting confused about the simplest things, genuinely confused. I feel anxious but i can't calm myself down. It gets I know untreated vitamin deficiency can cause dementia. I need help. I live with my parents and don't work. I tried to get my family to the doctor but they don't believe me. I am getting really hopeless, I am considering suicide because i don't want to lose my mind, but there is no way out. Can someone give me advice or guidance on what to do?"
B12 Deficiency,Is my B12 levels low?,"i have been feeling awful for the last 4 months, got my results from B12 test today, 296. No action required. I have made an appointment to see doctor next monday as i feel so low. Do you think i am wasting my time seeing doctor about the levels?"
B12 Deficiency,Is Vitamin B-12 Level 294 pg/ml Low,"Dear friends I am new to this forum, From past one year I have neck pain which moved to my lower back after some time, I feel really weak , feels pins and needles in my neck and arm . I have done MRI which shows only stiffness in muscles rest of things are normal . I feel light headed and depressed most of the time with tiredness , muscle aches and fatigue. Last week I done my b-12 and D3. My b-12 level was 294 pg/ml and D3 was 36.6 ng/ml . Please I need your help and advise on the level of B-12 294 can really creates such symptoms."
B12 Deficiency,Have been following discussion on B12 deficiency. Mine is 146 ng/l my dr says it's only slightly low,146ng/l seems low to me. Should I go back to the doctors?
B12 Deficiency,Hey,"Hey,For the longest time I've been feeling really fatigued and after constantly going back to my doctor she finally sent me for blood tests and the nurse phoned me and told me that my B12 level is ""quite"" low.So the doctor put me on 28 tablets of cyanocobalamin (1mg) but I don't seem to notice any difference even though the phramcist said I should notice after a week of taking them.The reason I am making this post mainly is because if I eat food such as cheese from dairy, or chicken from meat while being idle like watching television I notice this sudden build up energy it's like my fatigue lessens but doesn't go away completely, but when I do an activity like having a shower or walking to the local shop (30 min trip) and sit down to rest I suddenly become breathless and really fatigued again while sweating. Does anyone know why this is it what is causing me to gain and lose energy so quickly with food groups high in B12?"
B12 Deficiency,Second round of B12 injections? What's next?,"About a month before Christmas I got a blood test and it came back saying I had very low B12. I had already been taking cyanocobalamin tablets twice daily, as well as folic acid, for the previous 6 months, but I'm guessing it didn't work as well as they'd hoped.I knew something was up, because I'd been sleeping for at least 11/12 hours a night plus an hour long nap during the day. My confusion had been at an all time high (forgetting names of TV programmes I've been watching for years, street names, random words etc) and my depression had started to resurface again.They set me up for 3 injections twice a week for 2 weeks. I didn't really feel a difference in terms of physical health as I was still tired, getting dizzy and whatnot, but I returned 2 weeks later and got my blood taken again and when I went back for my results, they said my B12 levels were at 93. So, here I am again, getting the injections 3x a week for 2 weeks, 1x a week for 4 weeks and 1x every 3 months. The injections don't seem to be helping (at least I don't think so) because my levels shouldn't have dropped that low within a few weeks.Does anyone know what happens if I go back after these 10 injections and my levels are still really low?"
B12 Deficiency,I need my injection more frequently. ,I am having problems with my Dr. I have been having my b12 injection on a 10 weekly term now my Dr has changed it too 12 weekly. I get my symptoms of fatigue aching dizziness pins and needles in my hands and confusion at around 8/9 weeks. Surely i should be given my injection before any of my symptoms reacur I get so frustrated with my Dr I'm even thinking about being referred to a haematology dept at the hospital as I've read up the pins and needles and numbness in my hands can be the neurological side of pernious anemia and that my injection should be on a 8 weekly basis. Does anyone else have problems with this as well meaning there Dr is making them wait 12 weeks for their injection and that they get terrible pins and needles as well. Thanks Julie

B12 Deficiency,B12 injections causing Skin and Eye problems?,"Hello everyone. I was diagnosed with Pernicious Anaemia just over 6 months ago. I had my loading dose over 2 weeks (6 injections) and had another 2 every 3 months.I think I had the typical reaction: a really bad acne breakout lasting a good 1 or 2 months and a rash over my chest. The acne is reduced but is still there and my chest rash is more present than not.I also had one very bad bout of impetigo after waxing my legs! And now I just get a small impetigo blister that goes away quickly after a wax (always the same leg).After my 1st monthly injection, I started to get eye problems. I think I might have blepharitis now, but it's hard to tell. I can get by but I have very, very dry eyelids (sore to stretch when rubbing) and dry in the mornings (no eye goop). When wearing any form of makeup or moisturizer I get puffy eyelids with some occasional swelling... I don't get the crustiness that tends to come with blepharitis. I only have small little skin-coloured lumps on my eyelids and waterline. I heard this could be due to bacterial infection.So with sudden acne, impetigo and possibly an eye infection, I can only imagine the increase of B12 has triggered something inflammatory and a bacterial imbalance.Has anyone else had these kinds of problems? I can't find anything information other than acne breakouts."
B12 Deficiency,B12 injections suspended,"Anyone been told Pernicious Anaemia is not a chronic condition?my wife was diagnosed with pernicious anaemia 4 years ago and has since recieved regular B12 injections. 3 weeks ago she attended for her B12 injection. The nurse advised my wife that she may originally have only needed a boost. In addition she may now have an overdose of B12. Consequently the B12 injection was not given. My wife returns for a blood test shortly to determine her B12 level. And a decision by the surgery as to whether further B12 injections are to be prescribed. My wife's current symptoms include fatigue, light-headiness and dizziness. We are both puzzled on this action by her surgery as we thought pernicious anaemia was a chronic condition. Comments/information will be welcome!"
B12 Deficiency,am I getting the right dose of b12,"Since November I have had numbness in my entire body as well as feeling extrextremely fatigued. My blood tests show I was low on b12 and folic acid. I was given one dose of b12 by injection. Only 2 days after my numbness eased but never fully went away. 2 weeks later the numbness returned to the initial sensation and I felt more fatigued . I was tested for pernicious anemia , the instric factor antibodies came back negative and partial cell was positive. All other possible causes have been ruled out. My blood tests results now show as b12 in the normal range since I have had a monthly injection since November. My symptoms however continue and feel worse. All 3 doctors I have seen in regards to this all say I am not anemic and don't need more injections. They are giving me one more injection and that they say is to do me a favour. Are they right?"
B12 Deficiency,Low vit B12,I had bloods taken a couple of weeks ago and received a call from my gp surgery to see my doctor.

B12 Deficiency,Did starting B12 load up injections cause my stomache problems??,"I had bloods done and told I was anaemic and needed b12. I started with one every other day for nearly two weeks. During having them my chest started to get tight . A few weeks later I had chronic reflux symptoms burping constantly, trouble swallowing and drinking, stomache swelling, my mouth constantly watering chest felt like I couldn't breathe. I could nt eat as caused so much pain . I went to doctor. and was prescribed 30mg lansoprazole which went up to 90mg. I still struggled the breathe, I then was told I had crackling in my lungs and given antibiotics and inhaler. It's took at least 6 months for my symptoms to improve. I had the camera down throat which just had lots of bile stained fluid which they removed. After having bloods tests for celiac I was told I need a high dose of Vit D for three months.My memory is terrible , I ve lost so much weight I have to buy kids clothes. I have pains in fingers and still get breathless and then my lungs start to hurt. I have never been ill like this ever and it's caused me to have anxiety and depression.Anyone who has exerienced what I have or any info would be really appreciated . Thanks X "
B12 Deficiency,General Questions - No one to answer them for me.,"Hello,I was diagnosed by my Dr at the age of 18 with Pernicious Anemia after a long stent of Glandular Fever, then resulting in b12 deficiency. This deficiency causes me lack of concentration, tiredness and being really pale, they seem to be the most noticeable. I started having injections every 3 months standard practice in the UK, I noticeably started to drop off after around 2 and a half months my symptoms seemed to arise. This sounds odd but, I notice my injection starting to wear off when the symptoms come back but whenever I have anything sugary, I feel perfect for about 2/3 hours and then the drop after can literally cause me to just not want to move. Sugar, during my injection has no impact on me what so ever. So that’s a bit of background I have a few questions.Firstly, does sugar have this impact on anyone else? Is it that noticeable during the end of your injection period?Secondly, does the injection time seem to wear off quicker, dependant on if you’re working a lot or exhausting yourself? + Illness, if you are ill in the period does this reduce it?Lastly, is having my injection earlier at say about a month and half detrimental or not encouraged atleast?I ask these questions due to having my injection at the beginning of December and now starting to feel the drop off considerably. I am a Uni student and my busy period is all this time of year you see. I was diagnosed had my 6 injections etc but then moved surgeries due to Uni and now my main access is mainly to Nurse practitioners.Thanks to anyone if they can help answer some of the questions )Boogie "

B12 Deficiency,omeprazole side affects ?,"hello , I hope you dont mind me seeking help for my husband who does not 'do' the interent.He has been suffering from extreme fatigue for over a year now although symptoms have probably come on gradually. He has had test after test and the only thing they have found was anaemia which they treated but which didnt have any affect at his next blood test , the GP just says it his age (67 ) and its ok to feel tired . He falls asleep at the table after breakfast and may go back to bed again as he feels so tired and he has real apathy , this is not like him. I have also noticed that his pupils appear strange , smaller and as if he has drunk alot of alcohol.We eat pretty well, he eats meat and liver, eggs etc and lots of home grown vegetables but I feel that the medication may be the culprit. I am trying to get him to ask for a B12 blood test next time he has an apointment.He has been taking sublingual B12 and folate and he did seem to improve a bit but after reading about over use of B12 I bought a lower dose . 1mg I think.We are in the UK and its hard to know what to ask for. Has anyone experienced this sort of thing and how did they proceed.? also would he need to stop the B12 supplement for a period of time before a blood test ? thanks."

B12 Deficiency,Advice needed,I have had PA for 20 years and have 12 weekly injections. I must say I don't feel much benefit from them. I also like most of you feel foggy headed causing lightheadedness experience. Is there anything you guys take which helps alleviate symptoms of lightheadedness?

B12 Deficiency,"Had a blood test - Ferritin, Folate and B12 - what do these numbers mean? ","Hello I had a blood test about three and a half weeks ago. I was expecting the results within the week but since then half of the surgery's doctors have been off sick. I have no idea when my bloods will be commented on (have called every day as the receptionist tells me to ""call back tomorrow""). I asked for the numbers. Does anyone know what these mean?

B12 Deficiency,Is my b12 low enough for injections?! Advice needed!,"Hi there,I've joined this forum because I really need some advice. I am 27 years old.For a little background information, I would say at least, since my son was born 15months ago that I have struggled with exhaustion.This would seems obvious with a new baby right?! But this is what I initially put it down to, however since my son has slept through from 6weeks and is the easiest, happiest baby ever and I regularly get 8hours of undisturbed sleep a night I really can't blame him!A quick description of how I feel on almost a daily basis :Exhausted Yawning when I've had a full 8/9hours sleepVery poor memoryFoggy brain - struggle to remember certain words, often forgetting what I was talking about mid sentenceIrritable Emotional In March of this year I went to my GP and requested a full blood count.Three weeks later I call the surgery requesting my results, I was told ""blood results normal no further action required""I had a feeling this wasn't right and asked for a printed copy of my results, I suspected B12 may have been my issue, results for B12 as followsSerum vitamin B12 = 208 ng/L intermediate b12 level - consider treatment if other evidence of deficiency, eg neuropathy or macrocytosisNow after reading this I did get annoyed that my doctor failed to discuss this with me, I also suffer from ITP, low platelet count, I can't say if this is linked however I do have a blood condition and I feel I should be taken more seriously. From what my research has told me my level is that of a moderate deficiency and the low end at that!Am I correct in saying this?! From March to the present day I have actively tried to help myself by taking good quality multivitamins along side a rather pricey b12 spray, however although I feel a little better, and by that I notice a very slight difference when I stop using it, it definitely isn't enough to get me through some of my bad days, I personally feel I should be put of the injections as from what I have read if your body struggles to absorb b12 then the tiniest % actually makes it through the gut... Which isn't very helpful when I am spending a fortune on sprays tablets and medicine. I have two children and run my own business I can feel it affecting me and it's getting me down, I am usually an incredibly efficient person and it is now taking all my energy to try and remain that way.I have booked an appointment with a great doctor for the end of this month so I want as much information to support my findings, if anyone could help me that would be great!Thanks in advance,- Stacey "
B12 Deficiency,Is this plausible?,"I have been slightly iron deficient anemic all my life. Recently i have got sick with a chest infection and was bed bound for about a week. However, after i started feeling dizzy, when walking. i experienced vertigo, worse than normal vision, and strange sensation up my spine. I developed difficulty walking because of the lack of feedback on one side. At the point my bowels pretty much packed up and stopped working with nausia on eating and pain. After about 2 weeks of these symptoms i started to get other symptoms. My hands and feet would start getting pins and needles after the slightest pressure. A lot of muscle twitching and spasms, along with general fatigue. I went to my doctor and recieved a deficient B12 level of 189. with a lower than normal red blood cell count of 4.4. I have a lot of left sided abdominal pain and wander. Could I have pernicious anemia? i mean does it make sense? Because if not the next check after that is MS which i am very anxious and scared of.

B12 Deficiency,B12 injection due around surgery date,"Hello, I am due to have a hysterectomy on 11th November and my B12 injection is due around the same time. I really don't know whether to have the injection before or after surgery. I have heard that some drugs used in surgery can completely deplete any B12 levels you have, so with that in mind I am thinking as I am due the injection right now, I probably don't have any b12 left in me!!Can anyone advise me if I should wait til after surgery or go ahead and have injection before?"
B12 Deficiency,pale skin transparent even,Hi anyone know if pale skin is a symptom. I noticed this months before i was diagnosed.. i came off the sunbed and all the veins on my chest and shoulders where really noticable. I know heat can dialate the veins but this was like someone had took a blue velt tip pen and drew all over me. They are still like that now. Only on week 3 of loading doses.. it was that bad i went to gp but he said its normal. But he was telling me it was all in my head for 10 months before he finally tested me(when promted to off an a and e doc)so im asking does anyones skin become like transparent. Ive heard it can have a yellow tinge but thts it. My ferritin is 37 and my folate is 7.6 gp says this is normal.
B12 Deficiency,Low vitamin B12....,"Hello...I hope you can help me. I am not really sure where to start but hoping for some advice as my GP doesn't seem to understand. Firstly I have been quite symptomatic the past 3 weeks and I am currently signed off of work. I am a general nurse but this situation is baffling to me. First of all I started to notice some weight loss which was welcomed and not drastic. I also felt really shattered but have changed job and moved house so I expected that as a consequence. I also have suffered IBS but have been having diarrhea on numerous occasions in past 6 months even though I follow a balanced diet of veg and protein. However, the past few weeks I have Been really struggling. I first started to feel quite light headed and like a fuzzy drunk feeling in my head. At first it was every few hours then it increased to most of the time. I also found it a struggle with my eyesight and often feel blurred vision or a struggle to adapt to lights at night. I was sitting watching TV quite relaxed and suddenly I felt like my heart skipped a beat and I became light headed. I got really scared and decided to go to the gp. I ended up having to go to out of hours and they referred me for bloods but had me complete different tests. I could not walk in a straight line as I was losing my balance. This was very frustrating. I also started to get numbness and heaviness in my hands and right arm. Getting to sleep at night is difficult although after I sleep I still feel like I need more. Anyways my mood has been low and I have been diagnosed with depression previously.... but the way I am feeling I could see it rearing it's head again and I was really feeling sorry for myself. The gp diagnosed an inner ear infection and I started treatment but the dizziness and fuzzy head didn't lift. I got my ear syringed but the nurse said she didn't see that would be a reason for the way I was feeling. They diagnosed sinusitis but that nasal spray did nothing either.Today my bloods came back and are fine except my B12 is 158 and they say this is borderline but I am so symptomatic which concerns me if this is not really a problem yet at this level. I am really struggling as I feel so low and weak yet no one seems to understand It xDoes this sound familiar ? thanks for advice and taking time to read this essay Haha. I am 31 and feel like a dark cloud is over me x "
B12 Deficiency,non helpful gp and low b12,"My GP ran blood tests after I collapsed and fitted after donating blood.Results (when eventually came back) said I was had aniema low iron and my B12 was 145 I have been a vegetarian for 15 years and strict vegan for 3 yearsI have so many symptoms i sound like a hypochondriac.

B12 Deficiency,Does this sound like a b12 deficiency? Feeling lost ,"HELP! I've had blood counts, liver tests and iron level tests done. My haemoglobin and vitamin D came out as a tiny bit low but not too much to worry about. And now I'm lost as to what else I should do, the doctors now say that my symptoms are nothing sadI'm 19, female, with premature grey hair, a whooshing sound in my right ear only,My calves get sore/tender really easily, people have been saying I look really pale, my thumbnails have developed horizontal ridges across them which are on my toes as well. Some of my toe nails are dull/purple in colour and I used to get shooting pains in them but not anymore. It's just the skin under my toenails, so it's not raynauds.I'm only feeling a little tired and my brain feels a little fogged too, my confidence has dropped and ive been anxious about going to university when I'm usually fine with it. These days I just want to be left alone most the time.I also have this stitch like pain just below my right lower ribs everytime I walk, it doesn't seem to go away as it's always there when I'm just walking 5 minutes. I've also recently started to get itchy red hives on my skin, usually after I get stressed out or sweat, but I've never experienced this before and I'm using natural body washes that I've always used.Are these significant symptoms?? I feel like something needs to be fixed but my doctors don't seem to agree. what else could this be? Thank you."

B12 Deficiency,"Will my tingling in feet,hands and face improve after vit b12 injections",I ve been diagnosed with Vit b12 deficiency and have had the last of my loading dose of injections this week. I have so much energy and cant remember when I last felt so wide awake.. A lot of minor problems have disappeared but my tingling in feet hands and face are still bothering me. I have been told it may not go away but I am hoping it will. Anybody else have experience of this and did theirs go away through time?I am also still feeling lightheaded at times but not sure if that is my low blood pressure or just my body adapting to it working more effiecently!
B12 Deficiency,B12 deficiency causes?,"Hi,I have recently been diagnosed with a vitamin b12 deficiency (level was 148) however my new gp has pointed out that this came up on 2 previous blood tests spanning 10 years with the first showing a reading of 68. My old gp ignored this despite the reason for the tests being done were me having hundreds of mouth ulcers & feeling exhausted. My diet contains more than enough b12 so I've had another blood test for (I'm a little unsure of this bit) gastric antibodies & intrinsic factor antibodies? Gastric one was negative so the lab didn't bother with the intrinsic factor one as it's expensive apparently (thanks NHS!!!) I start having injections next week but would really like to know what's causing it. I do have symptoms (ulcers / tiredness / palpitations) but the reason for me actually visiting the doctor recently was because I've been suffering with Molluscum Contagiosum for almost 2 years & just cannot seem to shake it. Should I be pushing to find out what's causing the deficiency? And can having this cause issues like not being able to fight off this viral rash Molluscum?My IgA level also came back high but my gp has ignored this is that right? Thank you!"
B12 Deficiency,can anyone tell me if you have suffered vision symptoms with low b12? and what they are? please.,"Hi im having vision problems bit im not convinced they are from low b12.. my levels are 133 i had my first loading jab fri after noon...My vision symptoms are i see alot of purple and blue spots and flashes in peripheral vision.. lile when you have your pic took or stare towards the sun.. that kind of light thats burned into your vision.

B12 Deficiency,B12 deficiency and feel like I'm going crazy,"hi all,so bit of a back story , i was diagnosed with a b12 deficiency back in 2013 with a level of 149, i was then given a weeks worth of daily injections and told to resume with monthly bloods and an injection every three months. gradually i can feel my symptoms building again to the point i felt so unwell in the last few days i made an emergancy docs appointment. he didnt really understand the whole b12 can make you feel this unwell and has referred me for a brain scan which has no got me extreamly worried. My symptoms are the same as when first diagnosed but seem very severe although i was quite bad and havnt been for my regular three monthly injections for the last two appointments that were due thinking it wasnt doing any good, now im not so sure.I have numbness and tingling down my face and pins and needles in my arms, a foggy confusion where i really have to concentrate to be able to function and actually have been put off driving. i feel exhasuted and drained and could sleep all day yet cant sleep well at night. my moods are all over the place with feeling tearful and depressed and i have odd vision problems. i had an operation to remove my gallbladder 6 months back and the symptoms started to reappear then could this be a trigger?Do these sound like b12 symptoms or could it be something more severe ? like i say im scared about the mri ?I also have low vitamin D and hypothyroidsim.I would really appreciate any advice?

B12 Deficiency,Advice on B12 Injections Please,"Hi, hope you can help,I have been diagnosed with 'borderline B12 deficiency' (after 1 year!)Here are my results from July 2014:Serum B12 232 ng/LSerum folate 9.6 ug/LSerum Ferritin 88.9 ug/LDoctor did nothing at that point.

I have wind, bloating, tiredness, achy legs etc.Are these B12 deficient symptoms ?My doctor said I have not got Pernicious Anaemia, my haemoglobin fine ?I dont want my B12 levels to drop any more and insisted he do something.He prescribed me cytamen injections. 1000mcg injections, one a month for 5 months. First one tomorrow.I realise I should be happy that they are treating me (I know many people have to get a lot worse before they are treated)But is cyanocobalamin safe ? Am I on correct dose ?

B12 Deficiency,PA?? need to hear success stories!,"My problems started 7 years ago when I had bad digestive problems, unbelievable back pain and shooting nerve pains down my arms, blood tests showed up nothing and doctors thought it was in my head. 2 years ago it all started up again, I lost 11kg, my legs were so weak I could hardly walk and was off work for months, blood tests showed same antibodies against paretiel cells and gastrine at 1000! but B12 and iron were normal I was diagnosed with atrophic gastritis; back to today, I'm really tired and my legs are bad again, my new specialist has just done some tests, B12 is 267 and my ferritine is just 12. I'm also producing intrinsic factor antibodies (28,59 Au) I'll see the specialist in August but I've got a good idea that my results point to P.A.

B12 Deficiency,Pa Results,I was tested for autoimmune and rheumatoid arthritis about 8 weeks ago. I was then asked to come back for another blood test this week as my pa results came back positive. They said the reason was to make sure it wasn't a false positive. My question is how likely is it for that test to be a false positive. I was recently diagnosed as having fibromyalgia and I am now wondering if that's been the right diagnosis and it is just possibly pa or perhaps have them both. thanks for any responses.

B12 result came back as 276. The doctor left a message to say continue with iron for 3 months and that was it! I am really down as I don't know whether the iron will up my B12 or not?

B12 Deficiency,b12 stops working,"I have all the symptoms of b12 deficiency but the blood tests are normal (I didnt ask what they were). I told my doctor I felt better when I tired taking b12 and she said to keep taking it if it works.The problem is, I took tablets for a while, felt great for a week (and really hungry) and then they stopped working. This happened twice.Then I tried sublingual b12 liquid. This worked for a few days (I would get a hot flush an hour after taking it and then have more energy) but after a few days that stopped working too.I'm guessing that if I wasn't b12 deficient, taking the b12 wouldn't work at all.Does anyone know why they stop working?"

I have been back and forth the doctors for years with tiredness, headaches etc and have been fobbed off.

My results follow:b12 - 167ngferritin - 21ugfolate - 10.3ugVit D - 35I have done a lot of research on both iron and b12 deficiency and from my understanding anything below 200ng b12 is extremely low?

B12 Deficiency,Does anyone else have low B12 when your not anaemic?,I've started a course of 5 x B12 injections due to a low blood count. I'm not anaemic and my stomach test was showing normal. Also does anyone else feel sick for a short time after the injection and have a funny headache?
B12 Deficiency,Results,"I am so sad when reading some of the problems people are having getting their doctors to give them a B12 injection. I said in an earlier post what good doctors I have as from a routine blood test they called me to say my B12 was very low at 150. I wasn't anaemic and another blood test showed there was nothing goin on in my stomach so they don't know why I'm not absorbing B12. I didn't realise at the time how serious this was as my memory was going, I was having dizzy spells and the real worrying thing was going to the toilet. It was as if my brain wasn't telling my muscles to work and I would be trying for a long time before I would go. All this has changed and I am not losing it, going to the toilet regular without a problem plus other stuff I have noticed. I went to my doctors to thank them, when I told him the things that were happening previously and that my dad had suffered Alzheimers he sent me for another blood test to see how much it had improved. I had a full blood count done for B12 and Folic Acid. The result now is 1357 for my B12 and 4.5 for Folic Acid which is a little low. I am taking vitamin supplements to top this up and I already have my injections ready for my dose in September. I so feel for anyone that doesn't have this support from their doctor as I know how worried I was thinking I was following my dad with Alzheimers. Please don't give up, keep hounding them to get the help you need."
B12 Deficiency,Is this b12 deficiency? ,"HiFor many years (5+) I've been getting tingling in my hands and feet with weird humming sensations around my body. My feet and hands often feel like they're burning. My arms sometimes feel heavy and weak and I get ""growing"" type pains in my legs often. I've always felt tired and never refreshed when I wake. I've been checked out for Ms as my symptoms are very similar and mris have always come back clear. I've started taking a vitamin b complex supplement to help with anxiety (due to worrying I have ms) and I think my symptoms have improved slightly. I don't feel as much tingling or the humming sensations and I generally feel more normal. My question is could the b vitamins have been the reason for the improvement and I'm actually b12 deficient? I've had bloods done many times and I'm pretty sure b12 was included. No gp has ever mentioned it's not within normal ranges but I've been reading that you can still be deficient even within normal? I will mention it to my gp but I want to go armed with evidence that the vit b supplements have improved my symptoms so I need to know if it's possible! "
B12 Deficiency,How long did it take others to see results from Injections?,"Hi I'm new on here, I have not been diagnosed with PA, but have started treatment for low B12 levels yesterday, my level was 112 - my sister has PA so it is a possibility but my intrinsic factor tests were not abnormal so they are not entirely sure what has caused my low levels. My Dr ordered the tests as I am having difficulty swallowing. I have had many symptoms over the years which have all been blamed on my diabetes (even though my blood sugars have been excellent for many years) - nerve pain in left leg, almost permanent pins & needles and 'buzzing' feeling in my left foot, have been exhausted but put this down to all the nerve & muscle pain I've been experiencing, I seen the Dr about 2 yrs ago for 'palpitations' and was sent for an ECG which was normal, I have IBS, I've had problems with my mouth for about 2 years but was told to drink plenty of fluids and that I may have chelitis, I get cold feet and hands, get dizzy every day at some point but was told that was my BP medications, and suffer cramp even though I drink about twice as much water as recommended on a daily basis as my mouth is always so dry, and probably not connected to the B12 but I also suffer from short menstrual cycles and have been unable to concieve in the last 10 years with my 2nd husband but they could not ever find a cause. As I am diabetic I was taking a high dose folic acid prescribed by the Dr of 5mg per day - I've since found out this can actually mask B12 deficiency (although I am unsure why).Anyhow, from looking back in my records it doesn't look like this blood test was ever done and it makes me wonder if I could have had this for years unbeknown to me and whether alot of the symptoms mentioned above were due to B12 levels and not diabetes. So I am wondering how long it takes these injections to make a difference - I've had one shot yesterday and have 4 more to go over the next 10 days. If these shots help with any of nerve pain it will make such a difference to my life, I've had steroid injections into nerves and tried all sorts of medication with no success. Sort of hoping now that they've found this deficiency it may be the answer to a few of my medical issues over the last couple of years - although I'm not sure at 43yrs of age I suddenly want my fertility to return but my husband would be over the moon lol"
B12 Deficiency,B12 is low but cause is unsure -- could it be gallstones?,"Hello,Recently, I found out that my B12 was low, and I have been treated for it with injections with great success. I feel better than I have in a while. I was surprised to see today that it turns out I have intrinsic factor, fine and well, since I'm not vegan, vegetarian, or elderly.I've also been posting to the gallbladder forum here because I have chronic digestive problems ongoing since my gallbladder was removed ages ago. I've, at various times, had trouble with vitamin D being low and my thyroid pill which is a full replacement dose ""wobbling,"" which confused the doctor. I have classic post-gallbladder symptoms like severe runs, sorry to be gross, after most meals.My GP has not even asked me about my gallbladder surgery though and seems to want to test for all kinds of obscure conditions. Should I mention it to her? I don't want her to feel side-swiped. Also, my healthcare here in the U.S. is limited, so I have to make the most of every appointment. I'm at a sliding-scale community clinic right now and need to go in with specific questions and connections. I believe, but am not 100%, that I have a gallstone blocking the common duct. To confirm that, I need expensive and painful tests. However, I find the B12 injections immediately help other problems that have been ongoing! They act like a natural antidepressant on me and give me a wonderful, non-jittery energy. They've also stopped neurological issues like pain and clumsiness in my limbs that were driving me crazy. Have others with low B12 also had gallbladders out and then had digestive problems or been told this was the cause of it being low? Relieved I do not have pernicious anemia, although I feel for all of you, having thought I had this for the past week!Thank you!"

B12 Deficiency,Confused at results ,"Hi all, I'm new here so firstly hello , secondly I'd like some help as I have been having lots of problems since april 2013 and I'm kinda getting fed up at the moment and ill explain a little more. It started off that I have having pins and needles in my hand and shorting pains go down my arm, I had a burning sensation in my armpit, and back ache so went to doctors who sent me for MRIs. All this time I was limping, couple of weeks later after going for a walk round the nec, I had really bad back ache and sat down went to get up and my legs were so weak pain was so intensive, I just cried as I tried to walk to the car, got to the car to find I could not lift legs or stand up, I needed help, my husband came home and with his support I was able to foot shuffle back in to the house. This cleared up after about 5 days it was like legs got stronger every day. It then happened about two weeks later same thing again I start to do normal life things like any normal person and then my legs go again.

B12 Deficiency,Vitamin B12 injections-how long for improvement ,"Hi all.6 months ago I went to my GP complaining of severe tiredness, poor balance, headaches and tingling in hands and feet. A blood test showed a vit B12 deficiency. My Dr prescribed B12 injections once a month for three months. After three months my blood was tested again and it showed that the levels were still not raised enough so I have been continuing with injections every month. I am wondering if it is normal that I still get symptoms a week before each injection is due, and is it unusual that the levels have not risen much?Thanks!"
B12 Deficiency,Lack of vitamin B12,"Hi Folks I recently had a blood test and was told that I have a lack of vitamin B12 in my body. I know that B12 is obtained from foods such as meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, broccoli, brussel sprouts, peas, and cod. However, do I need to cook/prepare the meat, fish, broccoli, sprouts, and peas in a specific way i order to get maximum b3enefit? Also, would you suggest any particular type of meat and fish to buy/make? How about eating fish and chips? Although the batter on the chips isn't good for your health. Finally, regarding the dairy products. Is there any particular type of dairy products that I should eat? Thanks in advance for your responses."

B12 Deficiency,Tests,"I was diagnosed with PA about 18 months ago and get injections every three months. I find most of my symptoms are pains in my legs or left arm, asthma but my main concern are my digestive problems.I have diarrhea aboutique three times a week and in the last two or three months I have had to take a great deal of heartburn tablets. I am very bloated and am finding it difficult to lose weight. My doctor found that I had an enlarged liver last year but nothing has been done since then. I feel I am not being given the treatment I need. Us it usual to feel bloated and nauseous? Also, should the doctor be checking my blood levels? She has only done this once when I was first diagnosed.Thanks."
B12 Deficiency,Normal B12 levels but low ferritin.,"My health has really deteriorated over the last 2 years and I've seen many GP's and consultants and been through a range of possible diagnoses such as PCOS/pituitary tumour. Two years ago I started suffering with severe headaches, this was when i noticed the start of my health deteriorating, since then I've suffered many symptoms, the one I struggle with most is severe fatigure. I also suffer with shortness of breath after little exertion, dizziness, pale skin, weakness, lack of coordination, unsteadiness, foggy brain, impaired memory, moods swings, weight gain, irregular periods and many more. I also was diagnosed with a benign essential tremor shortly after feeling ill, with no explanation for the cause. I have had many blood tests over the two years, I suffered with high abnormal LFT's that were never explained. My FSH to LH ratio was 3 to 1 hence why they suggested PCOS but after an ultrasound they ruled that out. My prolactin levels were high, so I was sent for an MRI which then ruled out a pituitary tumour. My mum then spoke to a friend who coincidently suffers with pernicious anaemia and suggested I take B12 supplements, I followed her advice and I couldn't believe the difference it made, I had so much more energy in me and I was finally able to excercise and complete my work without having to have constant breaks. I hadn't felt so well since before it all started. I wasn't sure if this was down to a placebo effect, but after forgetting to take my supplement for a while my symptoms came rushing back, this happened twice and so I finally decided I needed to speak to my GP and consultant about it.My GP stated that my previous bloods last year showed a normal level of vitamin B12, but he would send me for a repeat. After being frustrated at this and looking at research I rechecked my old blood results to find that my ferritin levels have been consistently low but never brought to my attention and I also had unsual levels in my FBC some results would be above range and some below, none of them brought to my attention either.I am so tired of being ill and I'm really looking for the answer, even though my GP was pessimistic about it being a B12 deficiency, he said it was unusual that I had such a positive reaction to the supplement. I also suffered with anorexia when I was 13-16 and I have always wondered if there was a link between that and my illness today. If anybody could help in anyway possible I would be very grateful!

B12 Deficiency,mouth ulcers and facial nerve pain ,Could this be related to the b12 deficiency I have I take folic acid daily and b13 injections every 12 weeks I'm upto date on them all but the corner of my lips are always cracked and past month have had 2 bouts of oral thrush and ulcers. Thanks for any info/advice
B12 Deficiency,"B12 good, Ferritin bad","I now have monthly B12 jabs, and over a period of almost 12 months, my B12 has risen from under 100 to 879. This is great, and I can really tell the difference. However my Ferritin levels have failed to improve much, and are still just 22 (normal range 12 - 150). I'd be happy if they reached something like 75. I've been taking iron tablets and will step up the dose (even though they upset my stomach), but I wonder if any other sufferers have taken this long to improve. Is it reasonable for my Ferritin to take so long to rise, or is something else going on?"
B12 Deficiency,Just diagnosed with Anaemia ,Can anyone enlighten me as to what the actual symptoms are of anaemia or Pernicious Anaemia? I've had a hell of a lot of problems over the last year and only now have i been diagnosed with an iron deficiency...and im very confused! thanks in advance x
B12 Deficiency,B12 and ibs,"I have a low b12, not sure on levels, I have had 4 loading doses number 5 tomorrow, not really feeling any better as yet, had a rotten headache, feeling bit quesy, and it's making my ibs play up something chronic, anybody else had problems with ibs? I keep being told it may clear up after injections but am not sure on that "
B12 Deficiency,im sure I have pernicious anemia/b12 as so ill and gastrial parenial antibody but GPS wont agree,"even with supplements my levels were 250 or 320. I feel I am dying though I have other health issues may be causing issues.. I cant feel my legs and feet. Im shaking. crazy in mind. emotional. never sleep. all night stomach acid, sweats, heart racing. No menstruation only spotting for months. All smears false readings for years.Hair falling out. Psorisis. brother has to have injections. Ive changed 2 doctors surgerys now. None will listen. they say If i stop taking supplements for week and retest they will give me injections if below 200. I know I wont go that low as takes longer than week for supplements to get out and it wasnt that low before. Doesnt mean I dont feel ill and I thought it was about symptoms not numbers to be human! Quite frankly even the slight improvement I get with spray Im not sure I can bear giving up. Im awaiting to hear if I could have c at same time. Aswell as suffering what I think is auto immune arthritis undiagnosed with no medications. I dont know whether the under tongue spray is as good as injections in long term so just stick with that or whether to go week without supplements then to perhaps be told yet again I cant have injections anyway? Is there any ideas out there people? My D is also 52 when it should be 50-250 and Im on supplements for that too but they wont consider giving me anything for that either. Anywhere private I can go? I have visions of my body getting even worse by stopping things just to be told I cant have anyway. My bones are crunching and I have severe issues with spine and hips as it is and dont want to feel worse just to be told I cant have injections anyway. Is there anywhere in UK that you can have them privately?"
B12 Deficiency,What is A high Dose of sublingual B12?,"I have read online that pernicious anaemia can be treated by high doses of sublingual or transdermal B12. Can anybody tell me what amounts we are talking about here? I've been using 4 doses of sublingual B12 plus 4 doses of transdermal B12 a day for months and nothing has improved. My tongue is still swollen and my RBC count is still 3.9. I also read that some people don't absorb B12 sublingually so I've changed over to 8 doses a day of transdermal B12. Funnily enough, my doctor has agreed to give me a B12 injection monthly, but I never got enough of a loading dose to begin with so what I did get was a waste of time. Because I take B12 my blood levels are high, but somehow it's not being absorbed by my body. Do I need to take more transdermal B12? I have not been officially diagnosed with PA but I have little or no stomach acid and am now on a vegan diet. My iron and ferritin levels are ok as is folic acid."
B12 Deficiency,Vitamin B12,"Hi everyone. Well, back in 2013 I went to the doctors regarding a defiency in vitamin b12, this was due to my hair starting to fall out, tiredness, moodiness and a range of other symptoms. The doctor said it sounded almost as though it could be a deficiency, therefore gave me a blood test to confirm. My bloods came came back and they showed that there was a deficiency. I'd alos been tested for pernicious anaemia, however, the test for that came back negative, suggesting that I could fully absorb the vitamin. I was happy with the results and was told to take a two months supply of folic acid and vitamin b12. After that I would have to have my boods redone just to check my levels were improving. Again, went to be checked and my levels were okay, so I was told to take the tablets to keep my levels up. I admit, overtme I stopped taking them, as I;d been told that your body can store vitamin b12 for three months. So, I thought that if and when the sympoms started to appear, I'd know to take my tablets again. Well, I haven't taken any tablets for a while now, I've let my symptoms get the better of me. But, analysing the symptoms I'm experiencing now to the ones I was experiencing when I was first diagnosed, I feel like they may have got worse. I'm now experiencing symptoms of extreme tiredness, despite the fact that I go to bed at a suitable time and get enough sleep, I get tingly hands and feet, along with pins and needles, seem to be foretting certain words for things when trying to explain things.Suffered with some dizziness a couple of months back, which doctors never gave me a diagnosis for, just tablets to stop it when it came on. So, I'm reluctant to go back to the doctors or not and ask to get my leve;s checked again, or whether to just start taking my tablets. Although taking the tablets don't take much of an affect. My mum is also vitamin b12 deficient, she has pernicious anaemia, which makes me wonder if that can come on over time, or whether once ive been tested and the test has come back negative that, thats it. any help and advice would be greatly received. "
B12 Deficiency,low b12 not yet diagnosed,"On March 2nd I had b12 checked and results came back 166 with normal range 191-663. They were rechecked on 12th March and were down to 142. My symptoms seem worse but not sure if this is psychosomatic. My concern is I can't get to see doctor until 30th March to discuss results, get a diagnosis then start treatment. If my levels continue to drop at this rate I am concerned whether i will be able to continue to work. I know it isn't a long time to wait but wonder should i try to get an emergency appt in order to get diagnosis and possibly start treatment sooner. Thanks in advance for advice"
B12 Deficiency,B12,"Hi My daughter is 23 and recently had a blood test which says she has a b12 of 187. She has been feeling extremely tired for weeks and gets dizzy some times when she stands up, she has had an ongoing headache which she is under the neurologist for, we were putting her tiredness and dizziness down to the headache. Is this reading considered low? I also have low b12 and my mum had low b12. Her tests has been back for about a week but the surgery has not asked her to book an app to discuss this. I would be grateful for any advice on this as I am unsure what is normal levels. Regards B "
B12 Deficiency,B12 injections ,"Hi, I've just had my first b12 injection and I feel worse than before I had it. I'm extremely tiered and feel drained, is this normal? ?"
B12 Deficiency,is b12 deficiency always PA?,"Hi all. I am 4 shots into my loading jabs and have just read my prescription for cobalin and it says that the oral contraceptive pill affects the way the b12 works. I'm now very concerned as my doctor knows I am on birth control but didn't mention this when she prescribed it. I was hoping to try for a baby very soon, but am putting off trying until my b12 levels are up. Level was 181 before b12 injections started. Should I be questioning the prescription? Also, my blood tests for folates and intrinsic factor came back as low but I was advised just the b12 injections were needed, no mention of pernicious anemia. But after reading other comments it would appear if you have no intrinsic factor this is pernicious anaemia. I don't want to question the doctor as I'm sure they know best but I don't want to start trying for a baby until I know my body is fully ready!"

B12 Deficiency,"My experience, and lots of questions","Wow, that's amazing! I think (well, I hope) I have a little breakthough. I've been taking B12 injections, folate (since recently) and some other supplements for a while already (I wish I wrote down when I started the injections, sometime in January or February). My weekend days are Friday and Saturday. Ok, Friday out, enjoying a bit of nature. Suddenly I felt like I needed to go to the office to do some overdue work. So I went, and in four hours I did more work than in the whole last week. Again today I did a massive amount of work. My concentration was just there. I haven't felt like this in ... probably years. The tinging in my arm and leg (and tongue sometimes) finally seems to be getting better. It still comes back when I do cardio workouts, but only weakly- why might that be? The connection to cardioMore than half a year ago I had really big problems with irregular heat beat, which also mostly is gone now. An irregular beat every now and then, but there's no comparison.I've been wondering: This whole thing started with extreme irregular palpitations and a massive asthma attack. Pernicious anemia can manifest itself with dsypnoe.- Considering a lung challenge test only showed a 10% reduction and I've had weak lungs as a child already, is it possible that the symptoms of PA can have the appearance of an asthma attack and that the usual bronchodillators and other asthma medications actually do work?I read that red bloodcells live for about 3 months. Right, when I started with the injections in late January or early February then about half of my red bloodcells were created after I started the therapy, still of course they don't need to be in pristince shape.- I read that the usual injection therapy is only rather short. The NHS guidelines mention ""At first, you will have these injections every other day for two weeks, or until your symptoms have stopped improving."" I certainly did not notice any improvement after the first two weeks, and only now would I say there is improvement. I'm still injecting, though only once per week. Based on your experience, would you say the NHS guidelines are actually useful? Are the initial two weeks of injections sufficient to fill up the storage again and to improve on the symptons or is it really better to go on? Have I been overdoing things by still injecting weekly?Thanks a lot."
B12 Deficiency,Intrinsic Factor test results,"Hello all. I have had my 5 loading doses and the last was 3 weeks ago. Today I got the results of the IF test back, trouble is I would appreciate some help with them. My b12 at the start was 106, it is now 580. IF Ab result was 0.4. Doctor seemed pleased, but trouble is I still have symptoms, mainly neurological, cramping hands and fingers and feet, pins and needles in feet, twitching frequently, and numerous others. Forgot palpitations, they are bad too, maybe that is the worst. But there we are, Dr is happy. I go back in 3 months for next injection. What she doesn't know is that I have bought 5000 mcg. Methylcobalamin sublings and 400mcg Metafolin tabs. I intend to take them to supplement the b12 . Would anyone be able to give any guidance on dosages please, and what does that IF result mean,please?. Does it mean the IF is doing it's job properly? Best wishes xx"

B12 Deficiency,I'm newly diagnosed B12 deficient and feeling very unwell,"I have been feeling ill for months, probably longer with the same symptoms, palpitations, unsteady on my feet, absolutely exhausted all the time,recurrent bad chest infections, ending up in hospital once, where they looked for asthma as I was so short of breath,very swollen ankles, and out of puff when I try to do housework, headaches and I got the feeling over time that the Dr probably thought I was imagining things! In the last month things got so bad that the Dr. gave me all the blood tests for CHF as my symptoms, age and history seemed to point in that direction. Thankfully my heart seems to be ok for my age,71. the blood results did show that I had a low B12 reading,106, and the Dr gave me the first B12 injection last week with 4 more to come at weekly intervals. I was so pleased my heart was ok and she didn't say about low B12 possibly causing my symptoms and making me feel so ill. I am wondering if anyone can give me some hope of feeling better, and if there is anything I can do to boost levels myself. I have been taking PPIs for years because of a hiatus hernia. I have read a lot of the posts and they are very informative and you know that other poor souls are suffering too. I hope in one way that this is the cause of my probs, I never knew B12 anaemia could be such a debilitating illness."

B12 Deficiency,could it be PA?,"Hi, I wonder if someone could help me as am very unwell and getting desperate.I've been I'll six months with still undiagnosed upper abdominal pain. Had tons of blood tests (liver, pancreas, kidneys, blood count, anemia, blood clotting, autoimmune diseases), blood sugar, endoscopy and ultrasound which all show nothing. My reason for enquiring about B12 is due to many if the symptoms that have developed alongside thus stomach pain. I will list them in order of apoearance: Sore throat, chest and runny noseDizziness & near faintingAching all over like having the fluVery fuzzy brain often with slow movements and unable to focusBad nauseaExtreme thirstRapid weight lossNumb feelings in face and neckMuffled hearing that comes and goes ( I can hear but feels distant like cotton wool in ears)Pressure in headOccasionally feeling like I'm going unconsciousAll these symptoms have continued for 6 months sltho the weight loss, thirst and neuro symptoms are more recent. The weight started dropping when the neuro symptoms and thirst started.Im wondering if my stomach issue is preventing me absorbing B12 as symptoms seem to match. My GPs aren't being very helpful and starting to treat me like its all in my head but I know its not. As a result its very hard to get them to do more tests as they've concluded I'm fine from the tests I've already had so doubt they will test for B12. I have to keep pushing to have tests done and its very tiring when I feel so unwell. I purchased a B12 spray and tried some and a lot if the weird brain fog, depression and confusion eased a bit after just a few mins which is interesting. Thanks!"
B12 Deficiency,Trying to survive seven more days to see Dr. House,"I am 50. Had stomach problems all my life. IBS when my nerves kicked in. Bad migraines. Other than that up to eight years ago I was the most laid back 6/6 225 pound person there was.Eight years ago...I was working in the yard for about 5 hours. My back started to cramp in two distinct areas. Left and right sides just above my kidneys. Got to a point were I decided to go inside and take a break. Sat down and 5 minutes later I felt like I was passing out. That night as I was going from conscious to unconscious I would get a jolt of anxiety. Happened over a hundred times that night. Before i finally made it to sleep my intire body had pins and needles.This went on for three days. I went into my doctor at the time and told him listen... I have anxiety that is with me all during the day and what had happened. I hardly ever took medicine for any reason. He put me on Xanax. Had no clue what the drug was. Three years later my wife looked at me and said honey... your anxiety is really not being controlled. I agreed and took a full year on my own to get off the meds. Worse year of my life. In the meantime I got another doctor and told him I needed to sleep or I would be a mess. He put me on a medicine called Temazepam 15mg. Ended up taking two a night and are still taking them. After I got off the Xanax my muscles and tendons hurt and felt like they were ripping. Also got a new type of headache known as an aura migraine. So for the next 4 years got MRI of my entire body. They found that I have diverticulitis. They went into my throat found a hiatal hernia and used a bubble to widen my esophagus because I had some problems with food going down.Have that coughthat comes with the so called gerd so they threw me on Rhinidine 150mg once at night and once in the morning. Got on a gluten free diet. I actually stopped having the migraines that I had all my life. Wish I had known that years ago could have saved me hundreds of hours laying on the couch with a heating pad on my face. So here I am ..trying to keep enough calories in me and exercising but the muscle pain, the shortness of breath, the anxiety, the constant ringing in my ears, sensitivity to light and sounds, and those two areas on my back cramping up and hurting not to mention I have gone from 225 pounds down to 160 and being 6'6 thats pretty skinny. I believe I am loosing muscle and my mind all at the same time. So a friend of mine got me an appointment with a doctor in town who is in his 70s and specializes in determining what is wrong with you. He is like the Dr. House of my town. Today I feel as if I am not going to make it. I am not going to make it seven more days til my appointment. On top of it all I have had 4 deaths in the family in a month and a half and my 90 year old mother I take care of got sick and is in the hospital. I feel as if I am missing something. That there a virus or infection or chemical I am missing that is doing this to me. I have tried to figure it out for so long that it has beat me. I have never written anything on the internet before and have no idea why I am now other than when I was reading some of the discussions and I related to some of the things other people were going through it made me feel better. I feel as if I am waisting away. Guess I was wondering if anyone had this extreme of an experience with the muscle pain and weight loss and is there any hope of getting back to some normality. The things I am going to bring up to check for that I have learned is: Thyroid, adrenal glands, diverticulitis, hiatal hernia. I feel for anyone who is going through this type of illness. "
B12 Deficiency,New member - just completed loading injections B12. Lots of concerns - please help!,"Hi, I am looking for some advice on concerns I have. I had my blood tested a month go after three months of feeling lethargic, breathless, dizzy, suffering infection. I visiting my GP many times and was told ear infection then virus. I was so breathless walking to my office building my lips turned blue so I rushed back and they did bloods.They found dangerously low iron and B12. I was taken to hospital and given four pints of blood. My levels didn't rise enough and they decided it was B12 deficiency so I was given six jabs over 12 days.i completed last week and my energy is amazing (appetite too!) I have never felt so good. My GP says tablets are no go as I don't absorb B12 so I need jabs every 12weeks for life.i have had some acne since my last jab on the loading dose but thesis settling. However my husband kindly pointed out this eve that he can see my scalp (where my crown is) I hadn't noticed this or any increased hair loss. However he is right it's thinned. I have read that the condition can cause this.My questions are: Has anyone else had hair loss, if so can you take any vits to help with this and did the B12 jabs help it recoverAlso when having the jabs has anyone found 12 weeks to be too long? My GP said see how I feel might need them every 10 weeks if I feel lethargic before 12 weeks comes roundMy iron was low too and I didn't have much of it in my diet and the hospital said the B12 issue would be hindering the iron. I have started t have green veg nuts etc regularly. Would you take iron tablets too or wait and see what the bloods says before the first 12 weekly jab to see how the iron is naturally?Sorry for the huge post - Many thanks."
B12 Deficiency,PA: tingle and out of breath? ,"After running to doctors for quite a while for tingling lower leg and arm I was finally diagnosed with a mild pernicious anaemia. I've been taking iron for a while already as ferritin was low, and started feeling better relatively quickly, and ferritin started to fill up again. I also started to take B12 tablets, but they didn't really do anything After this diagnosis I started taking 1ml b12 injections, 3x per week, 10 times now.Well.. the tingling got worse I would say and spread out moreIn the last blood test the MCV is still near the upper edge of normal, MCH, MCHC have moved to the middle of normal. RWD was initially high, but has gone down again. When that test was originally done I had an asthma attack, which might explain the high RWD.Right, I feel good, only the tingle got worse. I don't know if it's related to the anaemia, or if I had such anaemia in the first place. If it was caused by it then I understand that the tingle might not vanish quickly? Anyone here who experienced a worsening upon starting a therapy? The doctor I'm seeing suggested only taking one injection per month now.Here's the strange bit: I was very out of breath the last few days. When I decided to do an injection again after a nearly 2 week break the out of breath feeling was gone in around 4 hours. That did happen once before, but I cannot imagine such a quick effect. Or is it possible?"
B12 Deficiency,Pernicious anemia - what to ask?,"I've been dealing with symptoms of pernicious anemia for a long time. A couple of years ago I was diagnosed with celiac disease, and cutting gluten out of my diet solved a few of my medical problems, but not all of them. I kept hearing ""give it more time to heal"" when I went back to my doctor countless times because I didn't feel well, but after two years my remaining symptoms are getting worse, not better.Over the last few months I have declined a lot. I have numbness and tingling in my hands, a dull pain in my feet when resting, clumsiness, headaches, worsening memory problems that are beginning to really scare me, lack of concentration, ringing in my ears, feeling like I'm stupid, depression/anxiety, balance issues, diarrhea. These things are causing problems with my life, from getting bad reviews at work which I never used to have, to just not being able to play a card game with friends. I had blood work done four months ago, and it showed that both my B12 and Folate were borderline low. This is the first time I had those tested. My platelet count is always high, and my MCH count is always low. I'm not sure what that means. Before being diagnosed with celiac my white blood cell count was sky high, but is now within normal levels. I'm sure that my problems stem either from B12 or MS, as they are the only things I know about that match my symptoms. Both are also related to celiac.I'd like to know if having borderline levels can still indicate pernicious anemia. Also, what tests/advice should I ask from my doctor? Is there anything else I should tell her or ask?Thanks!"
B12 Deficiency,New to this Forum,"Hi All,I'm new to this forum so I'm hopeing you'll be patient with me. I have quite a few health issues,but one that concerns me is the lack of B12 . I take Sulfasalazine for Rhuematoid Arthritis, which I have now found takes Folic Acid out of your body. But because I've also got Thyroid problem would anyone know if I may lack B12 or have I got this wrong and Folic Acid is another name for B12 ? "

B12 Deficiency,Is a Burning Tongue considered to be neurological damage?,"Hi...My tongue has been swollen and burning for a while now. I've also had a lot of other symptoms that suggext a B12 deficiency, but my blood tests for B12 are normal and my doctor won't consider treatment.What would be a normal dose of injectable B12 where there is neurological damage? Somebody suggested one injection a week for a month, but I thought I'd read elsewhere that where there is neurological damage, the dosage was one injection every second day for one or two weeks, then an injection every two or three months."

B12 Deficiency,Sudden high Folate levels - what could this mean in relation to B12?,"Hello everyoneI have posted previously and have this morning received my blood results showing from September when I last had a blood test an increase of my B12 from 282 to 358 good I thought but (could this be because Ive been taking 3 days of Ultra Vitamin B (50 ug) includes 200 ug folid acid??) in addition to eating eggs etc (I am usually vegan) Doctor says if I had PA no tablets would increase the levels - is this true? I tried to get re-tested today after stopping the tablets 3 days ago as I felt awful (thought I was reacting to the tablets) but my doctor wont retest me due to the cost to the NHS! However my FOLATE levels in September were 12.0 (in a range of 3.1 - 20.5) they are today 36.1 ug/L using the same range. Again could this rise be just down to 3 days of supplements? I am panicking now as Ive read on line high folate levels can mask true B12 levels in a blood test. I am trying to get privately the tests re-done to include methylmalonic and homocysteine to give abit more info about what is going on. Not sure whether Ive had an abverse reaction to the 3 days of supplements but numb foot which started 4 months ago - (I was taking the high dose pills then and have done sporadically since) has worsened but worst than that the last 3 days Ive not slept, had horrendous anxiety and aggitation, pacing, trembling and flicking of muscles all over body - particularly in the back of legs, confusion, writing and speaking wrong words, high blood pressure, nausea, sensitive tongue. None of this is like me and Ive NEVER had it before. Waiting for doctor to call me back about FOLATE readings but when she handed me the read-out this morning she didnt even comment even though there is a star next to the reading to investigate! Given the length of time private blood tests will take I am inclined to try 1000 mg of Methylcobalamin because Im terrified to try a B12 shot given my reaction to lots of drugs, preservatives and dyes which have landed me in A&E with terrible rashes, sensory reactions. Many thanks Tracey"
B12 Deficiency,I had a serious reaction to VB12 injections ,"In 1999 I was diagnosed with VB12 deficiency, was having injections for the first year. Then i was feeling a burning sensation in my back, always had the injection in right thigh. I told my consultant and the injection was put in my left thigh. Three days later I was doubled up in pain and could not walk. I was like this for 3 months, Then I was able to walk short distances but was all scooped over and had to use a wheelchair. I stopped the injections This lasted for another 7 months. In 2002 I had a schillings test done but I was getting over food poisoning but I still had to have the test. So another VB12 injection in my right arm and a capsule to swollow. within a few days my right hand was so painful and my hand started to claw. Went back to the consultant and she said she could not understand it. But because the test never worked, I had to have another test in March 2003, same procedure, but injection put in left arm. This time the pain started in my hand and tremendious burning also within a few months my toes started to hurt pain and burning. I refused to have any more injections. I could not work or even do much for myself. I was still under the consultant and in 2008 my whole body was starting to react to not having the VB12 and I was told. "" If you do not have VB12 you will eventually die my white cells was over taking my red cells. My husband was so shocked he spent 3 month on internet to find a VB12 I could take. Yes bless him he found a sub ligual called.methylcobalamin. At first i took one every day for a month. Had a blood test done and found my levels were too high, so now I take one every 3 days and my blood count is good. The only thing is I am still paralised and have a clawed hand and sensitive to the touch and still very painful. But after 13 years it's part of my life and my left hand still burns and my toes are painful still, also I still cannot work. But my husband found my cure not the doctors. But sadly he died in 2010 from lung cancer.Has anybody els had a reaction to VB12 injections."

B12 Deficiency,B12,"Been having b12 injections for 3 years now for panisous anemia i have them every 90 days, but recently I've been feeling exhausted well before the injection is due,the last injection however has not helped at all iam constantly tired and frozen all the time.

B12 Deficiency,Confused,"I was diagnosed with low B12 levels and further tests revealed that I had intrinsic factor.I was given the 6 injection course and was told I would have another in 12 weeks then again and then blood tested again. 6 weeks since my last injection and my symptoms are back. Feeling vague, tired, lethargic, irritated etc. How can it be that I have intrinsic factor but obviously have low B12?is it likely something else is going on? - any ideas/suggestions?"
B12 Deficiency,B12 injections only last 8 weeks ,"Earlier this year I was diagnosed with b12 deficiency and started having injections, I found the symptoms I have came back after 8 weeks but my doctor refuses to up my dosage. I feel like I'm going mad and that they don't believe me. I have bad memory loss and feel irrational after the 8 weeks and my gi symptoms return. Is there any other way to supplement this? I know I can take tablets but I don't know how good they would be? I need help "

B12 Deficiency,vitamin b12 deficiency ,I'm b12 deficiency. I was diagnosed with vitamin b12 deficiency in December 12th 2014. I've had 4 weekly injections so far.i get 1 more on Monday. Then every 3 months. I know it gets stored in the liver but how long will the 5 injections last. Before the 3 month injection. I'm on neo-cytamen 1000 micrograms. I'm scared confused I don't understand this.. my stomach wont produce b12.. I'm taking centrum for all the other vitamins because I don't know what else to do. My tongue is sore and the roof of my mouth. 
B12 Deficiency,Help - possibly allergic to B12 shots!!,"Hello there I am booked in to have my first B12 shot tomorrow as I believe I am B12 deficient. My reading is 282 and I have pins and needles in my left foot, dizziness, eyesight issues and generally feeling not real. I really believe I need medication fast. Have had extensive tests including MRI, brain scan etc and nothing comes up hence my current theory of B12 deficiency (I'm vegan) The problem I have is that I have had serious side effects to Gynest Cream (contains Benzoic Acid) and Beconase Nasal Spray and believe its probably the preservative. These include tongue numbness, confusion, blurred vision, dizziness. I am very worried that I could suffer an allergic reaction to the Benzyl Alcohol in the B12 shots. Is it possible to have a B12 shot without such an ingredient? Is the only alternative oral supplements which I fear will not be strong enough for me given my current symptoms. I really dont know what to do. Many many thanks Tracey"
B12 Deficiency,My doctor says I have weakly positive antibodies for pernicous anemia what does this mean???,"I have been going to my docs for over a year with different issues from headaches, shortness of breath, chest pains, slurred speech, sore mouth,fatigue, and the last bloods I got took were weakly positive antibodies for pa she never said anything. When I looked up pa I have all the symptoms should I go back to my doctor and tell her??"
B12 Deficiency,Numb toes for 4 months - B12 deficiency?,"Hi there I am female and aged 46. blood tests show I am perimenopausal. Four months ago I developed tingling in the toes on my left foot (only ever been this foot). it seemed to come on after having reaction to estrogen cream taken for spate of sudden urine infections. Ten minutes after taking the drug I experienced dizziness and blurred vision. 30 minutes later it happened again but then went and didnt return but then numb toes occurred. This has been constant and over the past three weeks has got alot stronger and prickling spreads to underside of foot with fluttering of nerves sporadically in left calf muscle. If I wear flat shoes my foot doesnt like it and appears to struggle causing a a horrible sticky prickly feeling in arch of foot - am much better with a tight lace up mid heel shoe. Infact foot much prefers no socks at all - seems rather sensitive to anything around it. No pain apart from on a handful of occasions sharp sudden pin like feeling in top of toes. Ive had MRI of spine - no pinched nerve - no neuropathy - did have spinal decompression surgery on lower discs following car accident 7 years ago but no apparent problems according to spinal surgeon and MRI. Had MRI of thorax, brain scan, thorough blood tests - all the usual including Lyme, B12, Thyroid diabetes but I am now wondering if this is related to B12 deficiency. I am vegan but am pretty good at taking supplements and fortified foods. My level four months ago was 282 - I have asked my doctor for a B12 injection (due to happen tomorrow) and he has agreed and tomorrow I will also ask for more thorough thyroid test as blood results show serum levels as 0.56 in a range of 0.35 - 4.94. Ive read hypo thyroid can cause B12 deficiency. All very depressing and causing lots of anxiety, sleepless nights. Not helped by a very stressful year losing two very close relatives in quick succession. Anxiety levels also went through through the roof recently when brain scan showed probable AV fistula in my brain - turned out there was nothing wrong just a slightly enlarged vein which was normal for me but lead to a cerebral angiagram on top of everything else. My neurologist has suggested re-doing all the scans and spinal puncture test - I am insured fortunately so getting tests done pretty quickly. After those not sure where to go - I seem to exasperating the experts which is very frustrating. Does any of this ring true with others? Many thanks Tracey"
B12 Deficiency,What Should I Do Now?,"I'll try not to drag this out. I was prescribed omeprazole 15 years ago and took it religiously for 8 years. Nobody ever suggested I should stop taking it. Right from the beginning, my RBC count started to fall. I didn't know about the connection between stomach acid, B12 absorption and RBC numbers. After 8 years I decided I'd had enough of taking medication and found I was fine without the omeprazole, but my RBC count still continued falling and nobody said anything about that either. Then I discovered the connection between RBC count and vitamin B12. Two weeks before my next scheduled blood tests I started taking sublingual B12 and for the first time in 8 years, my RBC count went up by 2 points, but when I suggested that I could have B12 deficiency I was told my test results for B12 were normal. So I started taking B12 sublingually and did ok for a couple of years, but now I find I need to take 8000mcg daily to feel normal and I have never managed to get my RBC count above 4.1 from a low of 3.8. On top of that, four months ago my tongue became swollen and burns or tingles if I cut back on my B12 dosage at all. My GP and a specialist both say because my serum B12 is high, I cannot be B12 deficient.There seems to be a huge amount of ignorance amongst the medical profession regarding blood test results for B12 deficiency. It states on this site that it causes either low RBC OR low haemoglobin...not both. Of course my haemoglobin levels are within the normal range, so in ""their"" opinion I don't have B12 deficiency.I am just about ready to have a mental breakdown over this. I don't want to go blind, become crippled or die because I can't get a diagnosis! I live in NZ and we can't buy B12 injections here otherwise that's what I'd do.I can't help wondering that there might be rare cases where some people can't absorb B12 from the blood and must have it injected into a muscle but of course what would I know? Again I would probably be laughed out of the office if I dared suggest it, but I just wish doctors would listen to their patients and listen to the symptoms they describe. In the 'good old days' before anybody thought up the idea of blood tests, doctors had to 'read' patients' symptoms without relying upon numbers on a chart. They might do well to go back to that method today IMHO.Does anybody have any suggestions about where I go from here?"
B12 Deficiency,B12 deficient and normal for all other tests?!,"Right so let's start at the top! I'm a female, 16 and desperate for an answer! Firstly the things I have been diagnosed with: OCD (severe) Anxiety (severe) Depression (severe) (taking Fluoxetine 40mg pd) IBS (given Anti spazmic drugs) So these are the things that I have been diagnosed with! I had a B12 deficiency at the level of 192 I think it was, so still inside the range but very low, this was treated with a series of injections. I also had heart surgery a little over a year ago to close a hole in my heart (ASD), that we suspect was causing familial hemiplegic Aura migraine! (Still get them but less and not as harsh) I had a serious reaction to the anaesthetic and ended up in a state of acute delirium, I was give a sedative that took around 4 hours to work because of the issues the delirium was causing. Aside from that I have had spells of eczema and that's about it. Anyway I have been to the Doctors surgery countless times now for various symptoms (listed below) :-Chest pains -Headaches during day and upon waking -Severe Fatigue-feeling of not getting enough breath-suicidal thoughts (am now out of school and under the mental health service because of it)-abdominal pain (admitted to hospital with suspected appendicitis twice (nothing was wrong according to tests))-Irregular and very short periods-brain fog-lack of concentrationThese are the symptoms I have at the moment. Now I went to the surgery the other day and asked what they were gonna test next and the Dr said that I've had full bloods so they've tested kidney function, liver function, stomach problems and everything, I have also had an ultrasound on my ovaries and nothing is wrong! All my tests have come back almost 100% normal minus a minute amount of blood and protein in my urine sample that they said was not worrying (This is aside from previous issues). I have looked into ME/CFS but everyone blames it all on medication or lack of sleep (I do sleep for at least 8 hours most days) I'm not sexually active so i'm not pregnant! The Drs say I'm fine but I know I'm not! Please help!!! "
B12 Deficiency,Sublingual and injections,"My daughter has been diagnosed B12 deficiency her level was 120 and has just finished the loading dose Hydroxocobalamin injections. GP recommending 3 monthly soon as loading dose finished. I have stated to doctor that i am unhappy with this as it seems a huge jump when she has been like this for years, therefore surely it will take more than two weeks to help repair damage and build levels back up.I am wondering is it ok to take sublingual Methylcobalamin 1000mcg in between injections as i really do not want her sliding back into the dark place she was in. Also doing preventable damage to her. She has really shown a great improvement since her injections and has even started to get her social life back. On a more positive note, i am mental health nurse and since daughter diagnosed 6 months ago and through the kind info on here and further research i have been preaching to my colleagues/doctors about lack of knowledge about B12 and finally they have started checking patients being admitted onto our ward and are taking more interest in the symptoms that individuals experience and link to B 12 deficiency. Already 3 patients diagnosed B12 deficient and have started treatment ?"
B12 Deficiency,No cause found for B12 deficiency...frustrated ,"Hi all,I know I've posted a few times on here now but I've encountered another frustration.I was told I had B12 level of 78 a few weeks ago. I had the intrinsic factor test which came back negative so doctor has ruled out Pernicious Anaemia.That's good don't get me wrong but the doctors have now offered no explanation and it's been a case of ""we'll see you in 3 months for your next injection"". I'm worried and want to know what's caused it. I've got no stomach issues other than mild upper tummy pain. Not on medication and never had a stomach op etc.And I'm not a vegan and eat plenty of foods which are a good source of B12. So I'm so frustrated and concerned about the unknown.Can anyone shed any light please? I'd really appreciate it!"

B12 Deficiency,B12 Deficiency &amp; Pernicious Anaemia,"After having blood tests last week I was diagnosed with a severe vitamin B12 deficiency and possible pernicious anaemia and have been started immediately on B12 injections (had 3 up to now with 2 more this week).My b12 level was showing at just 150 and I was told this should be 190 and that this is the cause for me being so lethargic, having no energy and feeling so run down for so long.I am now wondering when I should start feeling an effect of the vitamin b12 levels. One nurse told me it would be having an effect after the third, another said I wont feel any benefit until a few weeks after the 5th one and that I must then have them every three months to keep me topped up.Im currently waiting to hear bk from a blood doctor at the local hospital as my GP is unsure whether I am suffering from pernicious anaemia or not due to my age (I am 24) so Im feeling rather confused at the moment. My full blood count was fine and my iron levels showed up fine too. Any help would be gratefully received.Thanks in advance."
B12 Deficiency,Due for my first three monthly b12 injection top up.,"During the last three months, after my initial course of 6 injections, i have felt better than I have ever done, full of energy, lifted mood. Even my Tinnitus of 20 years standing has vanished!! Can't believe my luck. Hope whoever has been recently diagnosed will get some hope from this. Hope I don't come back here with my tail between my legs. I have been researching different forms of treatment on numerous websites and come to the conclusion that it IS possible to have alternative treatment to injections, so that's another path I may follow. My main reason for blogging is - can anyone tell me when one attends clinic for the top up, are bloods taken to determine the level or is it standard practice to administer 1000mcg hydroxocobalamin whatever the level is. Also, I have not bothered to see my G.P. since diagnosis thee months ago. But was amazed to find three days after my last injection, the pharmacist gave me an ampoule of hydroxocobalamin. Not sure if I could pick and choose when I would have the injection but I put it away until now 11 weeks later and will take it with me to the clinic. Is this normal? I mention it as so many people have said their G.P. won't give the B12 more frequently."
B12 Deficiency,"I have to take B-12 shots once a month. I get 1 cc. I ha...","I have to take B-12 shots once a month. I get 1 cc.I have been on this for about 10 years now. It showed up after I had my Galbadder remover. I started loosing weight. I couldn't keep on track. I was tired all the time. I was only 34 years old. I have a thyroid problem. I have been taking synthyroid ever since I was 18 years old. I got my thyroid problem from my mother. I am the only one in my family that has a B-12 problem. My parents are in their late 70's and they still do not have it. I have two sisters and one brother. When the first blood work was done I had no B-12 at all. I was put on B-12 at high doses. Shots every other day. Then the shots went down to once a week and then once a month. I am still at once a month shots.Everyone around me can tell if I do not get a shot for a couple of months. They say that I look pale, I get confussed more, and I complain about my mouth hurting like I have burnt it or something. I do not feel the change or see it myself but my family can see the differance. I do forget to get my shot. It is something that I do not put on my top things to watch out for. B-12 disorder does not give you any pain to where you can say: ""Oh, my B-12 is low I need a shot"". It is not like you have a pain that tells you. You get pain in other area's of your body which you do not think of as B-12. You do not have a self test that you can take at home. You have to go to the Doctor's office and let them check it through the blood screening. Missing a couple of months of B-12 will not show up in your blood work. Even though your body does store some B-12. I have found out the hard way that even though you do have some on reserve it isn't enough to stop some of the damage that it can cause. It does affect my nervice system. It does affect my energy level. Remembering things become a problem. It seems at times it was my thyroid but all the time it was the lack of B-12.I just have a hard time dealing with the fact that B-12 is always talked about in older people and here I am with it starting at the age of 34 and still going on with it at the age of 44. I am the youngest of my family and I am the only one with the problem. My mother and oldest sister have thyroid problems also but their B-12 is fine. I think there should be more test done on younger people. You do not find that much information on younger people with this problem. Even if there is I haven't read that much on the subject. It mostly talks about older people.[i:cd6c698c3d]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:cd6c698c3d]"

Ive felt like ive been going mad. My body has been mimicking most signs of pregnancy even lactation (has any one else experience this?). I've been so ill, tired and depressed for months but still had to push for repeat bloods to be done last week that have provided these reading of 90 which I believe is quite low?My doctor at the hosp cannot see me for over 3 weeks to speak to me about what these injections in tail and I have no idea what to expect. I work full time and I'm worried these jabs may make me ill?? Do they?Also I've read if u have low b12 levels it's dangerous to try for a baby? Is this true?

He has recently started on monthly B12 jabs, but did not receive the usual loading dose of 6 shots over two weeks. Is this unusual? He has an appointment with his GP to discuss his most recent test results next week, and I'd like him to be as well-informed as possible before he attends."
B12 Deficiency,Still suffering 2 months after loading dose,"Hi all. So i finished my loading dose early September but my pins and needles is still almost constant and my arms feel weak all the time.I've seen a neurologist who did an MRI and everything is fine so it must be the B12 causing it. My level was 78 when I was diagnosed, I had a blood test done last week and my level has risen to 800. So i have plenty of B12 in my system so why am I still suffering with these symptoms??Can anyone help? :-( I'm worried it will never go away."
B12 Deficiency,pernicious anemia and peripheral neuropathy,"please would you be kind enough to tell me why my gp decides to take a blood test to check B12 one week after my injection of b12. I do not see the point. Should the blood test bbe done before the B12 injection? Also I have been feeling dizzy, headaches, and even nauseous. I also have pins and needles in my hands, legs and feet on fire. THE GP took blood pressure which is low when I stand up or sit down but high when I lie down. I know that deficiency of B12 is the cause of the peripheral neuropathy and am having test done nxt month. Please help me because I am so tired and being a carer when I feel so dizzy and sick, is not joke. I am 64 years old and use to be on B12 tablet and folic acid previous to my injection. In my opinion it does not make sense to take blood test after the injection. Thank you"

B12 Deficiency,Am I at risk for anemia?,"I have Lyme disease, leaky gut and an unresolved intestinal issue that cause me pain every time I eat. I am also deficient in several vitamins. I take supplements, but I'm not sure if they are enough. I have lost a lot of weight recently and am not getting all the nutrients I need. Should I be tested for anemia?"
B12 Deficiency,just found out I have a vitamin b12 deficiency,"I had a blood test done for arthritis and the doctor found out from my results I have a b12 deficiency and my levels are only 80! I have never felt so tired, I am halfway through my loading dose but there doesn't seem to be any improvement in how I feel. I think I actually feel worse as I have had an upset stomach since starting the loading dose and keep getting pins and needles in my feet and hands. I really hope I start to feel more normal soon. Can anyone tell me how long until it starts to have an affect on me please as its really starting to bring me down now, thanks x"
B12 Deficiency,I've suddenly broken out in so many spots,I've remtly been diagnosed with PA. I finished my two week course of loading doses two weeks ago. Since then I have suddenly broken out in spots on my face. I have never suffered with acne before in my life and I am 28. I've been to the doctors and I've been given antibiotics and still no change. Has anyone else had this or know of anything I can do as it's causing me alof of stress. 
B12 Deficiency,My experience of Pernicious Anaemia,"I was severely iron-deficient anaemia and the GP sent me for bowel cancer tests and found nothing. I then had a panic attack with paranoia and the GP sent me to a psychotherapist. After three sessions with her, she said I was fine (although under a lot of stress). Exactly a year later (and I am now convinced that light levels play a part in this), I suffered from paranoia again. This time the GP said I had 'low mood' and put me on Prozac. I took this for 5 months and didn't feel any better - tired and foggy and confused. I was doing an OU degree at the time. Then I sat in front of my computer and did some research myself. I wondered if I was not getting enough thyroxine as I have had hypothyroidism for 14 years since the birth of my daughter. I went to see a different GP, she sent me to a specialist and he ran tests for all the autoimmune conditions and found I tested strongly positive for parietal cell antibodies. Note that my B12 level was 185 (the low level in this country is 165). I later found out from my family that a great aunt also had PA and suffered paranoia although much later in life (I was only 42). I now know that the B12 level in this country is TOO LOW and I am campaigning for a change. The level in Japan is 500 and they have the lowest rates of Alzeihemer's in the world. When you get enough B12 (via hydroxocobalamin injection) once you reach the level that is right for you the 'fog' clears. You feel more energetic, positive and clearer thinking. I have had to tell my new GP how to treat me as she didn't know - she admitted last time I saw her that some of her patients have levels as high as 2000! We need better communication, research and treatment for this very common condition."
B12 Deficiency,Intermediary Vitamin B12 Levels,"Hi, I'm new to this forum and recently diagnosed as above. I would be grateful to hear from anyone having the B12 injections with previous history of Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism.My GP said there was no more risk of clotting problems than with having any other injection but I have read otherwise.At the moment I'm about to have a further blood test (Intrinsic Factor) before probably needing to start the injections. Many thanks "
B12 Deficiency,B12 deficiency,I have joined back up again last time was on this site was 2011 which was when first got diagnosed with B12 deficiency. I have done well for myself but they stopped my injections in 2012 told me to go on tablets. But I lost track with the tablets and now my B12 is in mess again back on the injections again had my first today. 
B12 Deficiency,B12 Test Results,"Hi, I've just been re-tested for B12, just over 3 months since my last jab. The reading was 236. I'd value the opinion of other sufferers, as to whether this is an acceptable level, or whether it's fallen back too sharply, and I should be getting more/stronger shots."
B12 Deficiency,Will my levels definitely rise after 2 week treatment,I have just begun my two week treatment for B12 deficiency (injection every other day).My level was very low before treatment....74. I am just curious what I can expect that level to rise to after the two weeks? Does the level always go back to normal??
B12 Deficiency,other forms of B12 and how to increase frequency of injections,Will using sublingual or transdermal B12 help if someone is diagnosed with pernicious anaemia? I thought the body couldn't absorb B12 because of the lack of intrinsic factor - that's why taking B12 tablets is pointless.My daughter has 12 weekly injections and the effects only last about 4 weeks but her GP won't increase the frequency.Can anyone give us some advice please??Thank you in advance. 
B12 Deficiency,"Help, scared...just been told I have severely low B12!","Hi can anyone help please? I had some blood tests done last week because I was having dizzy episodes, severe tinnitus and moderate weakness/numbness in my arms, hands and pins and needles in my feet.I phoned my surgery on Friday for the results and they said I needed to book and see the doctor because my B12 levels were ""severely low"". I asked what the figure was and they said 78.How severe is this number? must be honest I'd never heard of B12 deficiency. Now I have to wait 10 days for the doctors appointment and my mind is racing. The numbness and weakness on my arms and hands is quite bad. I want it sorted now not 10 days. Is this damage permanent?I'd love to hear from anyone who has experienced these symptoms and can provide reassurance! "
B12 Deficiency,Prescribed 3 monthly B12 but not for PA,"Hi, I wonder if anyone can please offer me some advice. 18 months ago I was diagnosed with a B12 deficiency - prescribed 5 x B12 injections and sent on my way. About a year later I had symptoms return (had just had a baby) and this time my folic acid was low. Whilst taking folic acid drops my symptoms again returned, but worse. Another blood test has shown B12 deficiency again. I'm 3 out of 5 into my injections again. The GP consulted haemotology who suggested I have 3 monthly B12 injections from herein. My problem is this - the GP has said I don't have PA. I've had FBCs, but never any investigation beyond that. It probably isn't a big deal, and maybe it's just having kids that has made me aware of my own mortality, but does it go any deeper than this? If it's not PA then why could this be? Are they just treating the symptoms without getting to the route of the cause? Am I overthinking this? I'm a meat eater, mid 30s, mother of 2, I rarely drink. I have terrible slumps where I don't think I can get through the day. I'm exhausted but sleep terribly. My skin is terrible, my eyesight has worsened, my hair is falling out, I spend most of my days feeling sick and dizzy recently. I also get skin rashes on arms - pinprick, painless that seem to appear for no reason and fade a few days later. The combined symptoms and tiredness mean my mood is terrible and I end my days feeling awful for losing it and shouting. I just have such rage from feeling so rubbish. My GP isn't concerned about any of these symptoms.So is it worth me investigating the cause prviately, or should I just suck it up, take my B12 and stop Google'ing? I realise I might sound a bit of a hypochondriac and please tell me if that is the case. Maybe some people just don't find out why it happens, it just happens? Many thanks for any advice. "

We have been to Drs and hospital with no explanation of where the pain is from. He also is extremely weak and his muscles seem to have withered.

B12 Deficiency,b 12 supplement ,I was recently diagnosed with pa and am trying to find out if it is safe to take b12 supplements along with injections. I have had 6 injections in a fortnight which finished last Monday and will not get another injection for 11 weeks. Can anyone advise of their own experiences with taking both?
B12 Deficiency,Positive inf antibody test,"I haven't spoken to the Dr yet but just got my lab results for a test that I had to bug him to do. Recently developed tingling, burning pain and numbness in both hands. B 12 level was 249. The Dr kept telling me it was normal and wasn't causing the problem. "

Waiting for results of colonoscopy due to stomach problems.having b12 injections but no real change,trouble walking and balance affected.and advice gratefully accepted."
B12 Deficiency,B12 Deficiency or the Menopause?,"I'd be interested to hear if other sufferers have had a similar experience to mine:I felt rotten, my periods had stopped 8 months earlier (age 56), and I put my symptoms down to the menopause.Thinking HRT might give me back my energy/help me lose weight/stop the sweats and burning feet/cure my insomnia, I visited my GP (just retiring) who thought a blood test would be wise.She discovered B12 deficiency, but confirmed I was menopausal too.Her successor subsequently resisted giving me B12, and instead just offered me HRT.I declined the HRT, as it can be dangerous, and a quick online search had shown me that what I had taken to be menopausal symptoms were probably just low B12.I insisted on starting B12 jabs immediately, which quickly improved my health.However, one unexpected ""side-effect"" was that my periods hae begun again - with a vengeance - even though I am now nealy 58! Which caused me to wonder: How many women of my age dismiss their poor health as ""getting old"" or ""the change"", when they are, in fact, just B12 deficient? Might failure to report or diagnose low B12 explain the huge number of senile dementia cases we are now seeing amongst older women? "
B12 Deficiency,weekly shots for a year but still feel bad a day or so before next shot.,"Hi, ive had very little doc help in this area so id appreciate advise. Im 32 and had to diagnose myself with the deficiency. Had all the symptoms, even peripheral neuropathy. Blood showed 273, but still had to convince doc to give me the shots (im in the US, fyi). Im on methyl 1000mcg/ml a week, for over a year now. Almost all symptoms have gone away but directly before my next shot, I feel the mental decline, tiredness, anger (that's a big one). A day after the shot, I feel like a real, normal person again. A rollercoaster. From what I gather, I should be on monthly shots by now and I should nt have this decline. The cause of the deficiency hasnt been discovered, doc.isn't in any hurry. Im allergic to wheat (been off it for 5 years) and was a vegetarian for the first 20 years of life. Why does this happen and should I do anything about it? Thank you."
B12 Deficiency,Vitamin b12 and folate blood readings,"Hi, I would be interested to know what is the average reading for vitamin b12 and folate deficiency. My bloods came back with readings of serum vitamin b12 52ng/L and serum folate 2.6ug/L. Is there any cause for concern?"
B12 Deficiency,Does B12 Deficiency automatically mean Pernicious Anaemia? ,"Hi, last few months I've been suffering from fatigue, lethargy, depression, mild memory issues etc. recently got my blood tested for B12 and my levels were 100 against what I believe is a normal range of atleast 400. I've been advised B12 injections every alternate day for 5 days then every week for 5 weeks then every month for a year. Does this dosage seem right? Also how do I know I don't have PA? My MCH is high at 32.7 (against a normal at 32). Also are there any alternatives to taking the B12 shots and how do I make sure I'm not dependent on them life long?"
B12 Deficiency,May I have your thoughts?,"I'd really appreciate some outside opinions - I feel I've been dismissed by my doctor but her answers don't make sense to me.A few years ago I was constantly tired, somewhat dizzy and generally out of sorts. Blood tests showed I was B12 deficient but without anaemia. I was then tested for IFA and the doctor ruled out PA. I had a couple of B12 injections and was told it was dietary (I was pescatarian so that didn't sound right).My symptoms got a bit better with the jabs and I was told all subsequent blood tests came back within range. I recently found out that, while that's true, my B12 levels have been steadily dropping since the injections.At the end of last year tests showed my folate levels were below minimum so, when I pushed, I was prescribed high dose supplements. My B12 was lower than all previous tests but still just above the minimum line. When I queried the downward trend I was basically told I am fussing and my B12 dropping despite me adding meat to my diet 6 months previously is normal.I decided to take B12 supplements alongside the folate and bought some online. It's a few months since I finished them both and I'm back to being drained. I took 4 or 5 days worth of B12 (2mg) a couple of weeks ago but none since. I've decided to ask for blood tests again.Other info: my aunt has PA and my sister vitiligo, both of which I've read put me at higher risk.1) Am I right to be suspicious about my B12 or should I look elsewhere for answers?2) Could the recent supplements I took affect test results? If yes, how long should I wait before asking for tests?3) Are there any other questions to ask?Thanks so much!"
B12 Deficiency,"Possible B12 deficiency, unhelpful GP, worth testing?","I have recently developed some strange symptoms - a tremor throughout my body which is quite marked at times, changes to the way I walk/unsteady on my feet, random numbness in my hands and feet, shadowy appearance in my peripheral vision, muffled/dull hearing and crackling sounds in my ears, feeling very weak and fatigued. It is probably worth noting that prior to feeling very unwell, I developed significant tachycardia (130 - 140bpm resting). I requested to be tested for anemia at the time, though the GP put this down to side effects of medication despite this being a rare side effect. As far as I know, ECG was normal other than showing new tachycardia. Since then I have felt progressively more breathless on exhertion and often ""sigh"" for breath when sitting and relaxing. I do know from having an unrelated blood test that my full blood count is normal so no obvious signs of anemia. However, I have since learned that it is possible to be B12 deficient without being anemic. I have approached my GP to discuss these symptoms and I guess I have been hit with the young, anxious female label because he shot me a sarcastic look and stated ""that is not really anything"". He never looked at or assessed any of these symptoms. I have made several other attempts but just come up against the same brick wall. I do think it is worth testing for b12 deficiency in order to rule it out, but I do not want to approach my GP and suffer the upset. I am willing to have a private active b12 which I can arrange for myself - however, I have been taking multivitamins with 2.5 mcg b12 in daily for years, will this alter the results? Will this test be conclusive in and of itself, or will it need to be done along side other tests? Many thanks for reading."

B12 Deficiency,Can I receive B12 jabs while waiting for a gastroscopy?,"My doctor says I have B12 deficiency, but I've tested negative for the autoimmune condition that usually causes it, and have absolutely no gastric symptoms, anaemia, history, or family history of anything obviously related. I'm not losing weight, am not on any drugs, and I'm otherwise healthy.She wants me to see a gastroenterologist and have a gastroscopy, but my local NHS can't offer me even an initial appointment for three months, and I can't afford to go privately.I am tired, weak, aching, breathless and can't sleep. My research suggests that prolonged B12 deficiency does permanent harm and may predispose me towards stomach cancer. I've already had these symptoms for 6 months or more.I would like to have B12 injections in the meantime. Can you tell me if there is any reason why I should not?"
B12 Deficiency,Two Questions,"1. Did everyone get tests other than B12 to diagnose PA? I was told that given everything about me, PA was the most likely cause, and then we just started injections. 2. Does anyone know if PA makes recovery time from surgery longer? I just had my gallbladder out yesterday. It was a laparoscopic procedure. I'm just wondering as Hashimoto's and PA already affect my energy levels , if this will affect my healing timethanks everyone"
B12 Deficiency,Recently diagnosed and wondering how everyone deals with this? ,"Hi there, I was recently diagnosed with Pernicious Anemia aged 21 and wanted to find out how everyone else copes with it?I have finished my loading up period of 5 B12 injections in 2 weeks yet I still feel the same as I did at the beginning. I am constantly tired, I am getting quite forgetful which worries me and I have also broken out in spots on my face, upper chest, back and a little on my legs. I work in retail as well so I have to stand all day which I seem to have major difficulty doing and I'm unsure as to whether this is down to the anemia or laziness. I also find exercising really difficult or even trying to find the energy to exercise is the most difficult part (although I guess this is normal for most people!). However when that rare time comes when I do exercise, afterwards I feel terrible with fatigue and general out of breath for longer than I should be.Drinking alcohol also has an extreme effect on me, although I have read drinking alcohol uses the B12 quicker or something along those lines but I am exhausted for 2-3 days after drinking alcohol and I just want to know if this is something I should cut out as well?Basically I just wanted to know if these sorts of things were normal and if anyone can offer any advice to coping with it and some reassurance that it gets better than this! (I hope)Thank you in advance. "
B12 Deficiency,"This article is not only wrong, but misleading","Some patients seem to develop a psychological dependence upon the injection and demand that they need it more often. There is no haematological basis for this. In the past there has been a tendency to give hydroxocobalamin injections to people with little or no objective evidence of vitamin B12 deficiency but possibly with psychological problems. They seem to be especially susceptible to a \""need\"" to continue the injections.3,4 A little pink injection appears to have great placebo power.Who ever wrote this article, especially this 'little gem' of a paragraph needs to do some more reasearch!Many people who have Megaloblastic Anaemia/Pernicious Anaemia, need more than the 3 monthly injections. The B12 blood serum level bares little importance as to what is going on at tissue level and this has been proved. Further more, if you have neurological damage, which most of us do, the guide lines are for injections every other day until no further improvement, then 2 monthly thereafter.The insinuation, by the author of this piece, that Pernicious Anaemia/ Megaloblastic Anaemic sufferers are imagining the need for more frequent injections is very wrong. For more accurate information on treating these Anaemias, please go to the Pernicious Anaemia Society web site. The PAS work very closely with Doctors and scientists in order to gain the correct treatment for this nasty, but overlooked condition."
B12 Deficiency,"Help, I know I have pernicious anaemia, why cannot my doctor diagnose it?","My partner has all the symptoms of pernicious anaemia and her condition is progressive during the last 6 months. She is getting worse by the day. Too many visits to gp and specialists have not resulted to any diagnosis. So far bloodtests have shown B12 as well as folate in the normal range. Her mother was diagnosed with pernicious anaemia some 15 years ago after (also) a lengthy diagnostic process. According to gp all bloodtests have been done and nothing warrents the pa diagnosis.-Has anybody experienced the above and how did you go about it to get a diagnosis?-Is there a consultant in the UK who has build up some expertise on the matter?-If you recognise the above and can advice her please do so!Over the last couple of months she has seen herself change from a larger than life, energetic woman, into a person who barely drags herself through the days. The level of despair that this brings makes this mail a 'cry for help', as the medical professions is not yet responding. "
B12 Deficiency,Diagnosed at last!,"It has taken a referral to a private hospital to discover that I have pernicious anaemia. My serum Vitamin B12 level was 78 that my consultant says was [b:5c901319e3]very[/b:5c901319e3] low. Although I have been complaining of tingling hand and feet, shortness of breath, balance difficulties and memory loss for well over a year it was only last December that the culprit was discovered.Unfortunately neurological test show that I now also have slight neuropathy and it is suggested that this will not get better and that I will be left with the tingling and numbness in hands and feet.Although it is now one month since I had the 6 loading injections I do not feel any better and in some respects I feel worse with still having to rest every couple of hours or so and now I am concious of my lips feeling 'funny' and tingling at the tip of my tongue. I also have a constantly sore stomach. My doctor will not test the B12 levels again as he says they will now be high.Should I be worrying :?:"

B12 Deficiency,"Hi all,I am a medical doctor and was diagnosed with PA...","Hi all,I am a medical doctor and was diagnosed with PA 12months. I think I must have had it for about 5 years and it almost cost me my career, as I decided to ""give up"" because I couldn't find the energy to keep up. Its been a long story, the worst thing was knowing there was something wrong but had no idea what it was. I have had blurred vision, palpitations, night sweats, poor apetite, severe weight loss, gastritis. unsteadiness, confusion, anxiety and panic attacks etc. I was late in being diagnosed because initially my blood results were normal. The injections have given me my life back but the fatigue comes back after about 4 weeks ( at the moment my injections are 2 monthly). The main thing is knowing that there is something to explain all my symptoms. If there is any specific questions please ask and I will do my best to answer.

B12 Deficiency,b12 levels?,"Can anyone tell me if my b12 levels are normal at 373? After blood tests earlier in the year my levels were between 120 and 170 so was recommended b12 injections for life. After having monthly loading injections for 3 months have now been put onto 3 monthly injections. Initally I felt much better but now 2 months on and still 1 month to go before my next jab I feel as bad as before, so tired and sometimes feel I am on a different planet to everyone else!The doctor did another blood test and the result was 373. My doctor said that was normal and my symptoms must be due to something else. I thought 373 was still rather low, can someone advise?"

B12 Deficiency,any docs or experienced PA patients out there? Advice needed,"Hi. I'm hoping someone can help me a little. I'd better tell you my story and my dilemma, but I apologise in advance for rambling!I'm 27 and have been getting injections every 3 months for about 6 years now. Doctors stumbled across it when testing for other things when I was in hospital. I was initially given injections daily when in hospital for about a week and from then on every 3 months (now 12 weeks exactly since moving to a different doctors). I have never thought anything of it but I started looking on the web for the first time after my nurse advised me to see a doctor before starting to try for a baby as I may need my injections more often. I came across this website (and the pernicious anaemia society website) and have read things which raised a few queries so I'd be grateful if anyone can help.Does anyone have any info on frequency of injections before and during pregnancy? Also people seem to have been saying they get their bloods tested every year. Is this needed as I have never had mine tested since I was diagnosed. I only ever see the nurse, get the injection and make an appointment for the next one. Even when I was diagnosed I was not given any info on it, I was just told I can't absorb B12 cause I've antibodies so I need injections for life. But now that I've read up about it, I'm a little shocked at what it actually is and the variety of symptoms and problems it can cause. I never really thought of it as a big deal (and I suppose it's not cause there a lot of worse things out there!!). However, I did mention once to the doctor that I feel my injection 'runs out' before the 3 months is up, but he quickly cut me off and said, 'no you'll have enough to last you'. I just assumed the doctors would say if anything was needed cause they know I get injections cause it's on my file, but nobody has ever asked me about what symtoms I still get etc etc, even if I go to the doctors with other complaints. I also suffer a lot from palpatations and missed heart beats - which was investigated in the past (pre-diagnoses) but nothing came back as worrying - although my T-waves are inverted on the ECG - whatever that means. They are getting worse and are becoming frightening now. I've put it down to being stress related but wondering if it could be linked to the PA? I don't want to pester the doctors anymore cause I just feel like I'm moaning and they look at me as it I'm looking for things to be wrong with me - I really don't like going to them, and I feel they would have linked all this together or questioned me about things if it was relevant so I don't want to ask questions as I think they feel I'm trying to tell them how to do their job! I also get very light headed, especially when standing up - which I thought was low blood pressure but the nurse says I'm fine. Get really cold toes and fingers and find it hard grab things when hands are really cold - they seize up.Sorry for going on a bit, but a lot of things have just dropped into place during the last 24 hours and I'd like some advice and help please if possible. I know it's not life-threatening or anything, but if things can be improved a little that'd be great. But mainly it's just knowing the other little problems are all because of the same thing (PA) and will put my mind at rest that there's nothing else going on. Thanks a lot and well done for getting to the end of this!!!"
B12 Deficiency,I found out afew years ago i was B12 deficient and start...,"I found out afew years ago i was B12 deficient and started having injections once a day which i have to say i had never felt better. After a week i went to having them once a week then once a month and now i have them once every three months. I would say for 9 weeks out of the 12 i am on top form and feel fantastic, which after reading all the coments i feel very lucky, then for the other 3 weeks its all down hill. My work, social life and exercise sufers so much and i feel so depressed which just isn't usual at all. I feel if i could just get the injection after ever 10 weeks insted i wouldn't have to go through any of this but the doctor just won't budge on the 3 month thing. I feel for everyone who has this as i am sure some people just think we are moaning and don't realise how had it is but i am also very awear that we could all have a million things worse wrong with us so am thankful that for 9-10 weeks out of 12 i feel fantastic x x x x [i:717a095332]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:717a095332]"
B12 Deficiency,"Hi, I've got my first appt with a specilaist, also in G...","Hi, I've got my first appt with a specilaist, also in General Medicine, this afternoon, also because I have low B12, which isn't PA, but I had to wait 2 months for it. My GP said that starting me on the injections shouldn't affect any results, so I've now had 2 in total, once a month. They do not seem to help me get back to my normal-self, but I do feel slightly better than without them! It seems most people I've spoken to, do feel better after the injections, so I would suggest asking your GP if you can have these while you wait for your appt. so that you can start to feel more like a human! Again, speaking to people, it seems all different tests are performed. I was told that I will have a Gastroscopy (camera & biopsy down my throat to look in my stomach) as sometimes people with low B12 which isn't related to PA, can have stomach ulcers, crohn's or things related to your bowel which stop the intrinsic factor from absorbing the B12 from our diet which we need. I believe there is also a Schilling test to try to find the cause if the gastroscopy shows nothing, but not completey sure how that works. I think my appt today will just be talking to specialist & going through my history, & probably more blood tests, so they can discuss what procedures will be done & how. Hopefully they will be able to tell me a lot more, as i know many GP's do not know much about this. Hope this helps. Will let you know what the outcome of today is.[i:c41242638e]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:c41242638e]"
B12 Deficiency,"Hi,I also just discovered this site by accident &amp; am soo","Hi,I also just discovered this site by accident & am soo relieved to find people with similar symptoms to me. I have been feeling unwell for about 4 months now - seems like nothing compared to some of your experiences! Soo very tired that i have no energy, dizzy, heart palpatations, unable to concentrate or remember the simplest of things, feeling like i'm going to pass out, & more recently mouth ulcers. Eventually after many blood tests (and being told i was just stressed, must be worried about something etc) I was found to have very low B12. At only 24, they were very shocked so repeated this test, only to find it had dropped considerably in a week. I've been told that most cases of B12 deficiency are caused by PA (where body attacks itself via an autoimmune disease), but I have been tested numerous times & do not have PA. I have been having the injections monthly (now had 2 in total) in the muscle in my upper arm, and although my arm aches for a few hours after, I promise it really isn't that bad! I feel slightly better about 3 days after the injection, for a duration of about 4 days, but still too tired to work, go out, basically have a life! In the meantime i am waiting to see a specialist for a Gastroscopy(camera & biopsy in my stomach) & possibly a Schilling Test to try to find the reason why my body is not absorbing B12. If anybody else out there has similar symptoms or can help at all with more information???!![i:1376997730]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:1376997730]"
B12 Deficiency,I was diagnosed with pernicious anaemia 12 months ago af...,"I was diagnosed with pernicious anaemia 12 months ago after years of experiencing exhaustion, palpitations, dizziness, confusion, memory loss and back pain.I had an initial course of 6 B12 injections over 2 weeks and now get an injection every 12 weeks.I have had very little improvement in my condition even though my B12 levels are now in the normal range.I was diagnosed at age 39 but believe I have had the condition for at lease the previous six years.My GP expected an improvement after the first injection, then the sixth and finally he told me it could take six months to a year.My mother also has the condition and was diagnosed in her late twenties. She finds the injections give her a marvellous boost for about eight weeks and by the time she reaches the twelfth week she is thoroughly exhausted again.I feel no difference at all when I get an injection and do not know where to turn to for help. I feel my children have had at best half a mother for the past 7 years and am frustrated at the lack of help or understanding from both the GP who diagnosed the problem and my previous GP who failed to detect it in the preceding six years.There seems to be no help available for the people who do not respond to treatment.[i:3178d25953]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:3178d25953]"
