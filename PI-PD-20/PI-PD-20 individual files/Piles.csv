"Piles","fissurectomy/hemorrhoidectomy experience ","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/fissurectomy-hemorrhoidectomy-experience-738342","I wanted to share my experience with both my fissurectomy surgery (aug 2019) and my hemorrhoidectomy surgery (may 2020) in the hopes that this might be helpful to others. My fissurectomy was a year ago so i’m a little hazy on the details but will try my best.A little background on me: I’m a 27 year old female who’s been dealing with hemorrhoids for the last decade (ugh). They were internal but would prolapse during a bowel movement and would have to be manually pushed in. I tried adding more fiber to my diet but I don’t think I tried hard enough and basically just said ‘I’ll be dealing with this for the rest of my life’. I was too embarrassed to talk to a doctor about it, and they got worse over the past ten years (more of them, bigger in size, more difficult to push in, etc).The straw that broke the camel’s back was actually not that my stools were too hard but rather too LOOSE. I had a bout of diarrhea that lasted for a few months (I know, that’s a long time) and that, combined with the hemorrhoids, gave me a fissure in june 2019. The fissure was the most painful thing I ever dealt with and because I didn’t undertand what it was – and thought it maybe was from hard stools – I took laxatives and that tore the fissure even more. It stung during a bowel momvenet and for the entire day after, sometimes 2 days after. it caused spasms in my anus. I was so afraid of pooping, I only pooped every other day (I usually poop every day). I had to drop out of a lot of commitments due to pain and I was constantly shifting my weight when standing/sitting because I couldn’t get comfortable. I was in such pain that when I saw my surgeon and she tried to schedule me for a fissurectomy a week away, I said it had to be sooner than that and started crying. She obliged.My colorectal surgeon scheduled me for a fissurectomy in august 2019. As for the hemorrhoids, she suggested we do a few banding sessions in the coming months to get rid of them to avoid invasive surgery. My fissurectomy surgery itself was painless – I went under twilight anesthesia and didn’t feel a thing. They also did the first series of banding while sewing the fissure. The pain I was in after the surgery was bad– I actually found he painkillers (percoset) did less for my pain than just hot baths and extra strength Tylenol. Finding the schedule was key - I kept on a scheduled of 2 extra strength Tylenol every 6 hours and baths throughout the day, especially after a BM. I would wake myself up in the middle of the night to take my tylenol and a bath. I also took 2-3 stool softeners. I remember having a BM the day after surgery and it was SO painful – felt like my fissure was still irritated and I felt the rubberband around my hemorrhoid. I took a laxative (milk of magenisa) to get it going. I had to strain because I hadn’t yet figured out how to fix my diet. The BM’s afterwards were less painful, but still some pain to them. A horrible stinging pain and some blood. It really sucked. The good news is a week later I was able to resume my activities, but I still had a stinging sensation throughout the day. I also only wore dresses because shorts and pants irritated the wound. And pooping still gave me anxiety because I knew it would hurt during and sometimes afterwards for the rest of the day.The most frustrating part of my fissurectomy honestly were the months where I was recovered enough to go back to work etc but was still in stinging pain for the day after every BM. this lasted…I’m sorry to say….for a year. It was better at times and worse at times, but I still felt it, with the exception of maybe a month in january where I was ok. The reason for this is that I had prolapsing hemorrhoids WHILE trying to recover from a fissurectomy. So every time I had a BM, the hemorrhoid would pop out, irritate the fissure wound, and it would prolong the healing process. Additionally, my surgeon couldn’t do any further banding surgeries until my fissure was more healed. So I was kind of stuck in this cycle where my hemorrhoids would irritate my fissure, my fissure couldn’t heal, we couldn’t band my hemorrhoids, so the hemorrhoids would irritate my fissure, my fissure couldn’t heal, etc.A few things really helped me during this time (keep in mind my problem was LOOSE stools not HARD ones):Now, it took me a while to figure out all of these things – so my fissure healed reaaaaallly slowly and we weren’t able to resume banding surgeries until mid November (again, my surgery was in august). I had a really bad week in october with some loose stools and very bloody BM’s and pain for days, where I thought I would never recover. But using everything above (Especially apple sauce and heating pad) helped.I should also note that - with a few exceptions – incorporating the fiber gummies into my diet meant I spent around 10 min on the toilet. That was awesome. I was still able to eat almost everything I wanted and drink and even do the occasional drug lol. And have sex! Although probably taking those things out of my diet may have helped me heal faster…..hindsight’s 2020 lol.The banding surgeries helped – they definitely shrunk my hemorrhoids, which meant they stopped irritating the fissure! We did about 8 bandings, 1 every 2 weeks. A note about banding surgeries: I find if they’re successful (as in you really band off a significant part of your hemorrhoid), they will hurt that day. It’s not a horrible pain but it’s a cramping feeling, and it does decrease over the hours. the first hour can make u feel kind of sick. you’ll likely be ok either that night, the next day, or at the very latest 2 days after. Sometimes the banding didn’t hurt at all and I was able to go right back to work – but that usually meant it wasn’t a very successful surgery.After about 8 of these, it became clear that my hemorrhoids – though smaller than they used to be – would not go away without a hemorrhoidectomy. At this point, I was fairly pain free but still wanted to get rid of them, as they still prolapsed during a BM. So in early march, my surgeon scheduled me for a hemorrhoidectomy that would take place in late april.Then, coronavirus hit lol. So the surgery got rescheduled for late may. While waiting for late may, I began to experience pain again. The thing about banding surgeries is that they sort of ‘shift’ the hemorrhoids down there so to speak. So while my original fissure had healed, the hemorrhoids were now pushing up against the right side of my anus and causing another stinging pain. I thought maybe it was another fissure, but that seemed kind of extreme. It also could’ve been that the skin on the hemorrhoid itself was irritated and was causing some blood and pain. I picked up taking baths after every BM and sometimes only pooping every other day. The pain increased over the months but luckily I knew this surgery was coming up so I didn’t have as much anixety.The week before the surgery I stopped eating meat and stopped drinking (this was hard, I love to drink). I had read all these blogs so I was really prepared for THE WORST. I gave myself a Fleet Enema the morning of my surgery, so I was all cleared out and didn’t have to take a BM that day or the day after.The surgery – again – was painless as I was under anesthesia the whole time. I got home and felt alright. I took my first hot bath and took out the gauze packing which was uncomfortable but ok. as the anesthesia wore off, I started to feel the pain. It was more like a soreness/sensitivity rather than the stinging pain of the fissure. I preferred it. I took an oxy – which didn’t really help – but then had to wait to take tylenol. I took multiple hot baths and ate only fruits and vegetables that first day/night. The first night was rough because I wasn’t staying on top of my pain with medication – oxy wasn’t working but because I took an oxy, I had to wait another 6 hours until I took a Tylenol. That was torturous. As soon as I figured out my pain med schedule (2 tylenol and 3 advil alternating every 4 hours) pain, things began to get better. Additionally, the 1st day and night that area felt VERY tight and I felt super bloated – even passing gas was hard and I could only do it if I strained a little and was in the bathtub (a stitch came out this way – not sure if that’s normal or bad….). I was like how am I EVER gonna poop?? But the next day I felt a little less bloated and the next day even less after that.So now I’m on day 2 (if surgery was day 0) and I had my first BM today – it was very small and I had it in my sitz bath and then hopped in my regular bath after. It felt like I was passing a much larger stool but when I looked it was small. It was uncomfortable and sore afterwards but I have to say, after the experience of the fissure, I think I’m equipped to deal with this kind of pain. It was easier than fissure pain, much easier. There was some blood but honestly it was all right. When I pooped with a fissure and right after fissure surgery, I was screaming in pain. This time I was able to be quiet 😃Right now, I still cant really sit up unless I’m in the bath, moving causes some pain and discomfort, but if I’m lying down I don’t feel pain at all. Which is kind of incredible. I have slight bleeding but nothing terrible. I’m a little worried about getting backed up and wondering if I should attempt to have a BM every day or every 2 days. Ive also been eating very lightly so as not to have a painful BM but my weight is very low and when it dips below a certain point, things start to go haywire.So far, here is what has helped meOverall, I’m not necessarily glad I’ve been dealing with these issues for a year but I am glad I had my fissurectomy surgery before my hemorrhoidectomy because I am so much more equipped to deal with the pain and I know so much more about my diet and bowel habits. I would say if you’ve been through the pain of a bad fissure, this will feel much easier.I’m not even going to get INTO skin tags yet because my butt has looked so weird since my fissurectomy and they kept saying it was because of the hemorrhoids and the extra skin, so we’ll just see if it looks normal when all this is done. I heard someone say that wherever you’re at in 5 weeks is likely what you’re stuck with. We’ll see.I’m pretty sure the new stinging pain I was experiencing right before my hemorrhoidectomy was a hemorrhoid and not a new fissure – theres certainly pain in my butt right now but none of it feels like that pain. Time will tellI will update in a week or so, hoping that recovery continues to be alright and I continue to improve. Really glad I found this website, it helped me SO much, so I’m trying to pass it forward. Feel free to respond with any questions or any guidance! If youre going through it at the same time we can be penpals!"

"Piles","My hemorrhoidectomy recovery","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-hemorrhoidectomy-recovery-630143","Hi there, this is my first time posting to a forum of any kind regarding this issue, I have however read countless stories from all different places (over 99% horror stories) in the last couple of years. This post is to share my personal experience, answer any questions and also to get some feed back from people who have had the procedure done also. Forgive me in advance for the long post but I am trying to be as detailed as possible. First of all, I am a 33 years old male, 5’6 and 110 lbs. I have suffered from hemorrhoids since my teen years but within the last few years they have seriously affecting my life. I had 2 very large grade 3 internal, 2 external hemorrhoids and an extremely painful anal fissure. I had the 2 internal ones banded in April of last year but it didn’t work. My surgeon suggested that I do a complete Hemorrhoidectomy of int and ex hemorrhoids along with a sphinterotomy, HOWEVER, I have decided not to do the sphincterotomy because I was afraid of getting incontinence. DAY 1: I woke up in recovery at 6:00pm in excruciating pain, was given dilaudid thru IV with no relief and again about 15 mins later and then fentanyl about 10 mins after that and then 10mg of oxycodone by mouth, all which didn’t even touch the pain. I was then taken back to my room to get discharged. While waiting for the discharge nurse I decided to try to urinate but only a few drops came out. I then Signed my discharge papers and was wheeled out to my car and my father drove me home. During the car ride home (about 20 mins) the pain was still the same, I got home around 8:00pm, took stool softeners and ran a bath which offered some welcomed relief, repeated the bath about 30 mins later, ate some soup and crackers and took my second dose of 10mg of oxycodone and 1,000mg of Tylenol at 10:00pm. As I am writing this post it is 11:30pm and am in the bath again (3rd Time since I’ve been home). I Also would like to add that I am using extremely hot water because that seems to help better but am wondering if that could be harmful to the surgical area (any input would be greatly appreciated). The pain meds make me really tired but am not able to sleep for more than 15 mins because the pain wakes me up. All in all so far it is every bit as painful as advertised and i ABSOLUTELY DREAD when I have to have my first bowel movement. I am hoping that this doesn’t become one of those horror stories but so far it has been. But on the bright side, it has only been about 6 hours post op. I will be updating this frequently so feel free to any questions. "

"Piles","Anal skin tag removal","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/anal-skin-tag-removal-658102","I wanted to post my experience because I read a lot of horrible things about anal skin tag removals. I thought I had a hemorrhoid. I bled and felt the little lump. I lived with it for 4 years until it got too irritating. I booked an appointment with a colorectal doc who did a quick physical exam and told me I have an internal hemorrhoid and an external skin tag. She said they don't remove the internal hemorrhoids unless they really have to because the recovery is difficult. She said the external skin tag was created from a fissure when I was constipated. I had chemo 4 years ago for ovarian cancer so that is when I was most constipated.She said the skin tag could be removed in office with shots in the anal area. Um, no. She then said, because I have a previous cancer diagnosis and my aunt died of colon cancer, I qualified to get a colonoscopy. She could take it off the skin tag during the colonoscopy. She would cut it off and cauterize it.I decided to do it. I was told I would need a week to recover.The prep was the worst. I got through 7/8ths of the prep before I threw up. Then I waited two hours to drink the remaining prep. The next day I felt nauseated but didn't throw up again.The colonoscopy portion went ok. The IV was fine because they gave me some numbing medicine. I have had a lot of IVs and they are way easier with the numbing shot first. However, when I was in the procedure room, the anesthesiologist pushed the meds through my IV way too fast, it totally burned, way more than it burned with chemo. Then I quickly fell asleep.I woke up afterwards with gauze in my bum. They sent me home and I drank a milkshake to calm my stomach, then I went straight to sleep. I woke up later and ate a small dinner and took a normal dose of Miralax. Then I took a bath. I tried removing the gauze early on in the bath but it hurt. So I waited for the bath water to let the gauze float off. Then it didn't hurt. That night I took another normal dose of Miralax. The next day I pooped, but it didn't hurt. It was very loose. So daily I have been told to take 3 baths a day AND after every poop. I have been taking two doses of Miralax a day and it has totally worked to keep my poop loose and pain free. My doctor had said to take a different stool softener but I know Miralax works for me so that is why I am taking it.My doc gave me a SPRIX prescription. It is an anti-inflammatory pain reliever that is a nasal spray. Follow the directions and it won't burn as much. Holding your breath is key. I have found it to be helpful in reducing the swelling of my anal wound and the pain has decreased.I am on day 3. So far, little pain and I am up doing laundry, etc. I will update when my week is up.I think the baths are key to not getting an infection in the anal wound.

I have known about it for 2 months (timing issue) and the anxiety is unbearable. Suddenly I am concerned with sexual function post surgery. 15 years ago, I had pelvic floor dysfunction that would cause tremendously painful rectal spasms and painful intercourse. I have made full recovery by strengthening those muscles. I am wondering if post op pain is similar to what I used to experience after sex- it is crippling and nonstop. I have an active sex life, and am wondering how this surgery will impact it. I can find nothing on this subject- only 1 study that says there is a massive increase in sexual dysfunction for women after traditional scalpel surgery. While I understand it takes time to heal, once fully healed... are there any women out there who can comment on how the surgery has or has not affected their sex life? I have 3 total, stage 4, all external though my surgeon says they often run in columns and chances are I have some internal, though never had anything prolapse or indicate that this is true for me. I have had them since I was 20, and only flare a few times a year. Because of this, I am considering backing out. I am on access, so the insurance covers all costs and unemployed so recovery time could not be more convenient. Surgeons just say they ""don't know for sure"". I see no posts on this subject, so any insight you can offer is greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time!"

"Piles","My experience 5 weeks after Haemorrhoidectomy ","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-experience-5-weeks-after-haemorrhoidectomy-454634","After 5 weeks of doing the operation and especially after passing through some really horrible times of pain and misery I promised myself that I owe it to everybody out there to share my experience so that you can derive benefit out of it. I had suffered from haemorrhoids for 20+ years and it is only because I became severely anaemic due to blood loss from passing stools that I was forced to do the operation. With hindsight I could have avoided 20 years of misery, of lost sports, of severe discomfort in cars and planes by taking the plunge and doing it earlier. First and foremost, Haemorrhoidectomy is a very common operation and albeit there is a very small percentage where things get complicated the cases are getting less and less each year. I'm saying this because each and every person that does this operation will pass through so much pain that instinctively he or she will think that they are one of the few that is unlucky. Secondly the pain WILL PASS!I repeat it WILL PASS!The absolutely horrible, can't take it anymore, about to throw up, about to faint, never going to be the same, never going to be happy, stuffiness, bloated feeling, blade cutting through your backside pain WILL PASS! Realistically a person who does this operation will experience two annoying factors namely pain and discomfort. In the first few days the pain is so bad that you cannot think of anything else including the discomfort. After that the pain between going to the bathroom will slowly subside but the discomfort will increase primarily due to constipation. Hereunder please find my tips and what I would do differently if I could go back in time. 1. Increase your intake of fresh fruit and vegetables and water weeks before the operation to soften your stools and prepare your body for a life change. This diet change is a must EVEN AFTER the operation unless you’re a masochist and want to pass through it again.2. Cut out anything that might make you constipated – research. This includes alcohol, caffeine, chocolate, refined foods etc.3. Do a fresh water enema the day before the operation.4. Do a list of all the things you missed out on because of your condition and promise yourself to enjoy life more after the operation and to take care more of your physical well being.5. Mentally prepare that you are going to be in severe pain but also be aware that this is only temporary and that you’ll be tons better after that and the effort would have been worth it. Incidentally I was in excruciating pain for about 5 days, in agonising pain 5 days after that and in manageable pain 5 days after that. By the end of the second week I was 60% better. By the end of the fourth week I was 90% better with only the annoying leakage to take care of. By the end of the fifth week I’m 95% there.6. Try and limit pain killer as much as possible as they will slow your digestive system and the resulting constipation is worse than the pain.7. The feeling of still feeling massive haemorrhoids after the operation is normal. This is due to the swelling. The importance of having formed stools that are SOFT is important. Underline formed not diarrhoea as you need your system to re-function even if it means a little more pain.8. The feeling of passing sharp blades during the first few days is unavoidable. This mixed with blood and excrement is not a pretty felling or site but I PROMISE YOU it will get better.9. Keep the are dry otherwise you’ll develop sever rash – been there done that – more pain to avoid.10. Keep moving. The more you move the better your digestive system works, the less laxatives, the less bloated feeling, the happier you will be.11. Be prepared to go the bathroom at a moments notice.12. Run a warm sitz bath often – it does wonders to sooth the pain13. Squat not sit to pass stools. It’s easier to excrete, less painful and quicker. I’m still squatting and there is no way I’m going back to sitting. Before I sometime spent between 30 – 45 min on the loo. Now I’m in an out in 3 minutes.14. Keep the area clean. Use a bidet, shower or whatever you want. Use only toilet paper to pat dry the excess water. Again with hindsight this should be norm. After all if you covered you hand in excrement you wouldn’t simply wipe it off with toilet paper but you’d wash the hell out of it.15. Drink lots of water and take a reasonable amount of fibre. Taking fibre without water is a recipe for disaster.16. You are going to have to live with sanitary pads for a few weeks until the area heals sufficiently. It will get gradually better. I have gained a new respect for women who have to wear these things once a month; very annoying.17. After you recover promise yourself to share your positive experience and the things that worked out for you on a blog for the benefit of others. It’s kind of a chain get better advice blog.18. Most important of all – KEEP POSITIVE and take care of your health. You only have one body. "

Each time after I got the banding, it felt like when you have to get to the toilet RIGHT NOW or else you will poop yourself. Except of course, I knew I didn't have to go and it was just the bands. It also hurt a bit to sit down like normal. There was definitely a throbbing kind of pain. Each time I had the bands done, the feeling of needing to have a really urgent bowel movement (that wasn't actually there) went away after 4 hours or so.The first banding was really painful, the second two were very uncomfortable but the pain was certainly manageable. I can imagine how bad it would suck if that throbbing pain the first 4 hours after each banding stayed there for a week or two, that would definitely not be nice.So my question is - For those of you who have had the hemorrhoidectomy, when people talk about the pain, what is the pain like? If you had the banding and the hemorrhoidectomy done, was the pain from the banding similar to what you felt when you had the hemorrhoidectomy done?*EDIT: I realize there's a lot of threads that describe the pain of bowel movements (""like glass cutting your insides"" seems to be a common description), but I haven't come across a thread that has compared the pain of a rubber band litigation to that of a hemorrhoidectomy. *"

When will the pain stop? + My Learnings So Far.","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/4-weeks-after-my-hemroidectomy-when-will-the-pain-stop-my-learnings-so-far--735467","Hi all,Hereby my journey over the past 4 weeks after my hemroidectomy. Goal of my post is twofold:1. Help future readers what worked and didn’t work for me. I felt so miserable that I promissed myself to write something when I started regaining some energy and headspace.2. Ask other hemroidectomy patients to advise on my questionsSee below what kind of (pain) medication I have used (and am still using). Hemroidectomy patients here, if you have any tips please let me know. I am currently far from my 'normal' state, both physically and mentally.Short Background, see below for more info on mentioned medicationI had 2 (category 4) external hemorrhoids removed under full anesthesia. After the procedure, I woke up and the pain was bearable (painkillers were still doing their work). As these ran off, the pain was also bearable. I went home the same day. At home, I did not have to pass motion for 3 days (as your entire system is emptied before the surgery this is normal apparently).However, then the drama started. I was taking Codein/Paracetamol and Celecoxib, but this didn’t do anything for me during my BM. Literally 0.0. On the 4th day of being at home I was literally crying on the toilet (I'm a 190lbs, 6ft 30 year old guy). My wife decided that I needed to go back to the hospital. They said ""pain is normal"". I have had some broken bones and such in my life, so thought I was used to something. But this I could have never imagined. In the hospital they didn’t do anything, expect drug me up even more. But still the painkillers (Celecoxib, Tramadol) didn’t work. Only when they started giving me Oxynorm (20mg) it become bareable and my BM anxiety stopped accumulating (I was so scared of going to the toilet...). After a few days in the hospital I was sent home.Now, 2 weeks after the hospital, I'm still on a lot of medication (see below) and I'm still taking Oxynorm (10mg, once per day). Having BM still hurts like hell without painkillers, but at least I'm not crying anymore. So I guess its an improvement. When will this become 'bearable'?Curious about your thoughts readers. The doctors told me my pain is quite exceptional (and some people don't even need painkillers, that’s total BS I think. My pain threshold is normally quite high, so I don’t understand what I'm doing wrong).My Questions To Hemroidectomy Patients1. Is it normal after 4 weeks to still feel such a sharp pain during BM?2. Is it normal to still have blood in your stool after 4 weeks? Especially when I didn't have it for the past 3 weeks. Only had it today and yesterday3. I'm afraid I also might have a fissure. Is this possible and how can I check for this?My Learnings for future patientsWhat generic medication have I been taking for the past 4 weeksWhat pain medication have I been taking for the past 4 weeksPain killers I used before but didn’t work for meWhat other stuff Have I usedIf you have any tips, please reach out. If I don't respond (sorry in advance), I hope the overview above helped at least a little bit.John"

","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/i-have-cured-my-lifelong-issue-with-hemorrhoids--358114","Suffered since ten and now fifty seven, late Father senior consultant. Mother had the operation and was worse than before after it.I just had pain until I was about thirty and then the bleeding started, it got very bad and was a constant worry. About three years ago I started thinking of an idea. These things are blocked veins, so I wondered if I massaged them while in a bath of warm water what would happen. If I could loosen the blockages slowly over time, it might just work.So I got on my knees in the bath after soaking for a while and washing, soaped my fingers up well with soap, then lined my fingers and thumb in a straight line, then massaged the area up and down and around. I did this about three times a week. After two or three weeks of this method of massage, I found that they had all but gone away. I do the same thing every time I bath or shower, I am rather vigorous with this method now, pushing the line of fingers around and at a faster rate. My bleeding stopped almost immediately, I have never had any pain since and the once not tight orifice of my ass is now, about as good as when I was a younger man.I have had probably four or five small bleeds when using toilet paper since, but I used to bleed that many times a week before I started this procedure.i was worried that a clot could cause an issue once it was released, but by starting this method with care, I am as happy as could be again.

"Piles","My recurrent haemorrhoid flare-ups are almost always followed by high fever and chills. Why?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-recurrent-haemorrhoid-flare-ups-are-almost-always-followed-by-high-fever-and-chills-why--736069","I was born in 1987, so I'm almost 33 at the time of writing. Since the last 4 years or so I have suffered from episodes of haemorrhoid flare-ups, many of which have been followed by a fever within hours. After the first couple of episodes I have been referred by my GP for a colonoscopy. The diagnosis has been grade II piles. This is not surprising as, unfortunately, these seem to run in the family. However, I seem to be the only one developing a fever during flare-ups.Let me give you a bit of extra details about these episodes. Ever since reaching the adult age, I occasionally noticed little traces of blood on the toilet paper. It has always looked bright red and it has always been an inconspicuous amount (almost like a faint line traced by a ball pen). About 10/11 years ago I had my first ""big"" flare-up during a bowel movement and I could literally see blood dripping into the toilet bowl from the rectum. As far as I can remember, I did not develop a fever that time. Then, about 4 years ago, I had a similar episode, with quite the same ""copious"" amount of blood. This time though, I started developing a fever. It got up to about 39 C pretty quickly as I had quite some violent chills. The first time I went to the GP I was dismissed with ""it's just the flu"". After the episode occurred again after a couple of months, the GP referred me for the colonoscopy, which confirmed grade II piles and excluded, e.g. Crohn's disease or anything more serious. Ever since I had about 6/8 more of these episodes and the latest diagnosis is now a simple ""inflammatory response"".Let me add that I have also had some flare-ups with a fair amount of blood that haven't been followed by a (high) fever. I have somehow noticed a positive correlation between the ""violence"" of the inflammation and the amount of blood that I lose during these episodes (and while we talk about blood, let me also add that I carry beta-thalassemia minor, which is a common trait of Mediterranean people).The cure that I have received for these episodes is paracetamol for the temperature (I tend not to take any paracetamol unless the temperature goes above 38.5 C; if my body wants a higher temperature than normal, it probably needs it to fight some infection) and hydrocortisone suppositories for the piles. From my side, I try my best to ensure a good intake of soluble fibre and water to keep the stool soft. Indeed I manage to keep them so and have regular bowel movements each day.Given that the only diagnosis I could get from my GP so far is ""inflammatory response"", I have tried to come up with a couple of theories to really explain what is actually happening, as I appreciate that haemorrhoids are very rarely followed by more serious complications. My main theory is that, when the laceration is quite large, either the tissue or the bloodstream gets infected with bacteria on the stool and generally in the gut. The fever is then a response to a generalised inflammation to get rid of the pathogens that made their way in. As for why some times these episodes are not followed by a fever, I think it is because in those cases I was able to pass all the stool. In the cases where I develop a fever, the stool felt harder to pass and would remain to press against the haemorrhoid, temporarily blocking the blood flow and allowing the infection to get in.As for the causes of the flare-ups themselves, that remains a mystery to me. I have thought that there might be some foods (in particular, something contained in a particular type of foods) that could cause the haemorrhoids to swell. Looking back at my diet, there usually have been bell pepper in my meals following the episodes (I do not normally eat bell peppers). Other times, a spice like ginger seemed to have been present in my meals. However, there have been cases where such foods and spices have caused me no problems at all, so I don't have enough empirical evidence against this or that food.My main worry about the recurrence of these episodes is that, whilst my immune system seems capable of coping (or perhaps overreacting) to whatever is triggering it, I might not be this lucky in the future, especially when it starts weakening with age. Perhaps these episodes will stop occurring, but what if they get worse? So, apart from the most sensible recommendation of trying to avoid causing flare-ups by avoiding straining and keeping the stool loose (consider that my job forces me to spend hours seated on a chair), what else can I do to prevent these episode, which are clearly recurring despite my efforts? And furthermore, what is actually happening to me? Could this be the indication of a more serious underlying disorder?Thanks."

Then the person goes MIA when people ask for a update. So some back story im 27, and had my surgery on 11/23/17. So in about a week i will be at the 6 month mark. I had 4 hemorrhoids removed all together. 3 smaller internal ones and one medium sized external one. Overall would i do it again? definitely, but there is alot of stuff i wish i knew before hand. Plan on taking atleast 2 weeks off of work, more if you in any kind of driving job/physical labor job. If you fall into that category take a month off if you can, if your doing physical labor take it easy for atleast 2 months.My doctor originally told me i would be back on my feet within 3-5 days. But i spent the first week pretty much laying in bed on my side. After about a week i was able to walk around and do normal activities somewhat, but it was not a comfortable experience at all. Bending over hurt, walking up and down stairs hurt, getting in and out of the car hurt and i pretty much carried a pillow around everywhere i went. Overall though i think the 2nd week was worst than the first. You should get some good pain meds to get you through the first week or so, but once they run out you start to feel everything u didnt feel the first week, plus combined with the fact you going to be moving around more. If i had to do it again, i probably would have suffered more the first week and taken less meds then saved them for the 2nd/3rd week. A word of advice looking back is even though you are in pain you should take the minimum amount of pain meds you can. They will make you constipated and the last thing you want after hemorrhoid surgery is to be constipated. Trust me i learned that hard way. Start taking fiber pills a week or so before surgery and dont stop until you feel 100% better. Try not to eat anything hard either. I pretty much ate, mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese and bought a bunch of those ensure drinks for the first two weeks. You want whatever is going in you to come out as easy as you can. Liquids/soft foods are your friend.It took me about 4 days after my surgery to finally use the bathroom (why i said dont take to many pain pill) and im not going to lie it was excruciating. It took about 2weeks in total to be able to use the bathroom without being in alot of pain and 3 weeks for it be be ""comfortable"". But the first two weeks were definitely the worst. I legit almost passed out i was in so much pain a few times. Dont push just sit and wait. If it doesnt work try again later. You will be in there for a bit, take you time. Over all id say it took about a month to use the bathroom normally. I bled almost every single time for the first 2-3 weeks. Then it slowly stopped over time. In the end it took about 2 months for me to stop bleeding. Also dont be afraid if you look in the mirror and see what it looks like. Its going to look horrible the first month or so. But after about a month most of the swelling should have gone down and it will start to look more ""normal"". Within 1-2 months id say about 50-75% of the swelling should be gone depending on how much work you needed. It took me about a month in total for me to be back to doing my normal activities without being to uncomfortable. The only real issues i had was sitting for to long, or bending over to pick stuff up. It isnt really a pain, its more of a tightness, kind of the feeling of having a pulled muscle. I was originally told the swelling/tightness would last for 2-3 months. For me i say that more of a minimum. While the swelling went down alot after 2 months (id say about 75%) the tightness and stiffness stuck around. I went back to the doctor at the 4 month mark to ask him about it and he told me i still had some healing going on for the external one and to give it a month or two. After 5 months the stiffness has gone away, now that im coming up on month number 6 and i would say im about 99% back to normal. Which sort of makes sense since scar tissue takes around 5 months to heal. While 6 months seems like a long time to deal with this its really more like 2 months of actual pain. The third month your going to be annoyed here and there by it, and 4-6 you should start to forget you even had the surgery. The only real issue id say after its all said and done is i still have some loose skin where the stitches were on the eternal one. When i mentioned it to the doctor on the 4th month he said it can be easily removed with a office procedure in about 2 minutes if i wanted. But i should wait to see if it goes down a bit. I originally had a little loose skin on the other side (from the internal one swelling) when talked to him and thats completely gone now. So i figured id wait another month or to see what happens before i have that done. But once that is gone it will almost look like i never had the surgery at all. Overall im really happy i had it done. Yeah it sucked for a few months, but ive been dealing with them since i was 15 years old. So 5 months of pain to no longer deal with hemorrhoids was well worth it. Id definitly do it again if needed (but i pray i never have to) lolLastly this might fall into the TMI catagory but im bi some im going to include this for the girls/guys out there who like anal sex because when i searched i found almost nothing. One of my concerns about this whole thing was my sex life. My advice is take a break for atleast 5-6 months before you try to put anything in there, then when you do start small. I tried around month 4 and it hurt alot, wait till your feeling 100% better then wait a extra month. Your getting a new a**hole in the end. Imagine the first time you ever put something in there, well thats how its going to be again. If you feel any discomfort, just wait a bit longer. I tried again about a week ago, and while it still wasnt easy it was 100x easier then it was at month 4. So you sex life isnt gone, its just postponed a bit and you need to slowly get back into it. It was a night and day difference between month 4 and 6, so i assume its going to get even easier as time goes on. "

Push your fingers into the skin and direct your fingers towards the root of the hemorrhoid. Push your fingers until they close to your buttock bone. Move your fingers in a circular motion to massage the external wall of the anal canal where the hemorrhoid root is located. Massage 50-100 times.Repeat daily until the hemorrhoid disappears. You should feel an improvement within one week, but it may take up to three months for the hemorrhoid to completely disappear. It's a good idea to continue this practice daily even after the hemorrhoid has gone to prevent future recurrence.I found this cure on a massage cures site run by a man in the Philippines. It helped me resolve a hemorrhoid that had been bothering me for ten years.In my internet research I also found testimonials by people who had resolved their hemorrhoids either by massaging the anus itself or sticking a finger inside the anus and massaging the hemorrhoids internally. These methods did not work for me, although they may well work for others."

It's all well and good when you feel yourself improve, but I'venoticed that the recovery isn't linear i.e. some days/weeks things seem to get worse before they get better.One thing that's really bugging me is I keep getting these painful patches of skin on my left side, about 5mm-10mm from the anus. (All of my hemorrhoids were internal). The skin feels tender to touch. I can't see much going on because it's under hair (sorry this is gross), might be a bit red. It feels a bit like when you have a blind pimple under the skin, although there isn't much of a lump. it could almost be a rash but I haven't had a rash with that kind of tenderness before. Sometimes it goes away and then comes back in a different spot. seems to be getting worse, covering a larger area, although relatively it's probably a tiny area, like the size of a jelly bean, but almost completely flat.It's not a major thing, but really bugs me.

"Piles","Hemorrhoid surgery recovery tips","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hemorrhoid-surgery-recovery-tips-490593","Hemorrhoidectomy recovery I had a hemorrhoidectomy two weeks ago. The doctor warned me that recovery process would be painful. But I didn't think it would be this intense. Here are a few tips to ease the pain. It made a world of difference in pain management for me:1) ice packs-- most ice packs are not shaped for your butt and the flat ones only numb the butt cheeks, not the surgical site where you need relief. So make your own! Buy diapers (any size 3-6) and fill it with 3-4 cups of water and put it in a ziplock bag (for hygienic storage) and in the freezer. Once frozen, the diapers are curved perfectly to your anus area and won't drip as it melts either because the gel is designed to hold in liquid. I use one diaper several times before tossing. Just put it in a ziplock bag and refreeze. 2) squirt bottles--clean yourself with squirt bottles, not even wet toilet paper or baby wipes were gentle enough post surgery when the area is extremely raw. I bought two big squirt bottles at the drug store and fill them up before any bowel movements. 3) Boneal-- after cleaning the anus with the squirt bottles, I apply boneal (otc lotion for anal cleaning) lotion on toilet paper and dab it on my anus. It relieves the pain and itching that come later in the healing process. 4) sitz bath-- Do this 2-3 times a day and definitely after a bowel movement. Sometimes, I have my bowel movements in the sitz bath to ease the pain. Just remember to rinse it with soap and hot water right away if you have a bowel movement in there so you don't sit in fecal water and develop a uti on top of everything else.5) if possible, stick to lots of veggies and soups for the first two weeks to allow the wound to heal. No starchy foods and anything binding!!! These tips were given to me by the maternity nurses after I had a baby, but they are completely relevant here and I am especially grateful for the ice pack diaper trick! It was the ONLY way an ice pack can be applied to that anus area and not to my butt cheeks. Good luck and speedy recovery. BTW-- get all this ready, especially the diaper ice packs before surgery so you will have it immediately after you come home from surgery. You'll be in so much pain and not very mobile, so have all the relief remedies prepared ahead of time!"
"Piles","Hemorrhoidectomy recovery experience","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hemorrhoidectomy-recovery-experience-533728","I had a hemorrhoidectomy a couple of years ago and I used this site quite a lot during recovery for tips so i decided id finally share what happened with me in case it helps others. My piles were BAD. they didnt cause me pain but they eventually got to a stage where they were bleeding CONSTANTLY. I had appointments with the hospital (UK- NHS) on and off for about 18 months and was repeatedly told that they're been banded and i should be fine. The problem continued and I kept going back. After one particular sigmoidoscopy the nurse was wheeling me back and was saying everything was fine. It was at this point i had to stop her and said no, everything wasnt fine. I explained id been in several times before and I kept getting told i was fine only to go home and bleed profusely. The bleeding was excessive to the point that I was anemic and was on verge of a transfusion. Upon hearing this, the nurse took me back into the surgeon who said he would have another look. I dont know HOW differently he looked but he told me I had an extreme case of circumferencial hemorrhoids that were actively bleeding as i was on the table and that surgery would be required. I had a weird sense of dread and relief. FINALLY they've found the problem but OH GOD, SURGERY. I woke after the surgery and was discharged soon after having been told that i may have some discomfort but healing time would be 2-3 days. I say this with no exaggeration or dramatics but that was just absolute inaccurate bullsh*t. I was in excrutiating pain when the morphine wore off. I couldnt move without severe pain, I couldnt walk or stand up or do anything without help and severe pain. I didnt need to go the toilet until the following day and every single minute motion caused severe pain and the act of actually passing my stool was almost unbearable. To give you some perspective on me and my threashold. I've been knocked over by a car and fractured by skull, I've broken my hip, pelvis and elbow in a bad fall, ive had tattoos etc etc....NOTHING comes close to how painful this was. I dont tell you this to put you off....i tell you this because at one point i found myself sat on the toilet almost in tears (LOL i have to laugh at this now!) wondering if this pain would ever actually end and it was in this mood that i came across this website. It was a weird relief to read that other people have had horrendous experinces too and that it was not just me. I read about having sitz baths and what foods could help with toilet visits etc and I actually had some hope that I would get better.The only thing that helped with toilet visits was showering after. I cralwed into the shower after each visit and let the warm water wash me up and it soothed the burning pain considerably. I was bed ridden for 3 weeks and even when i could move around a bit easier on my own, i had these muscle spasms that would come on unexpectedly, cause a short blast of pain and then disappear. All in all i experinced pain to varying degrees for around a month. I had on and off bleeding for around 1 - 2 months to the point that the doctor actually recommended i wear sanitary pads which i did! The recovery obviously depends on how serious the piles are but if they ARE serious, you can expect a horrible bumpy ride after. I say this....because I wish someone had told ME this so i at least knew what to expect other than being told id be out of action for 2-3 days. I could have prepared myself a bit for it. Do I regret the surgery? No way..... it was a month out of my life that wasnt great but its given me a lifelong solution and i've never had problems since. SO my advice is, get the surgery but mentally prepare yourself for a crap ride afterwards but look forward to being rid of them for good! hurrah!"

However, I wanted to provide a somewhat positive story to counter balance the more negative ones out there. If you are considering this surgery - it is only day 3 and I am already happy I did it. I will add the caveat - I only had one external hemorrhoid removed. I also have read a few medical studies that say LIS helps with hemorrhoidectomy recovery.Prior to surgery, I was very anxious and therefore I did not eat much two days before. I’m not sure if I recommend this or not, and wouldn’t want to suggest anyone not eat. I also started stool softener about two weeks before, and started eating clean two weeks before. I also highly recommend installing a bidet - I got one off of Amazon for really cheap and it’s been the best thing for recovery so far, because you don’t need to wipe as much and irritate the areaDay 1 - Surgery dayI arrived two hours before my procedure. I was not instructed to do any bowel prep, just not to eat past midnight the day before.They get me in the gown and insert the IV. I meet with my surgeon, 3 different nurses, and the anesthesiologist. They’re very kind and reassuring (I was definitely in a bit of a panicked state). They were able to get me in early and before I knew it I was asleep!I wake up in recovery and feel nausea, which they give me something for that makes me feel better immediately. I did not have any pain. I did have a terrible uneasy feeling which apparently is common.All in all, I was at the hospital for 4 1/2 hours from start to finish.Day one is uneventful otherwise. I go home, I have some chicken noodle soup with crackers and take my first Percocet to try and stay ahead of the pain. I also take stool softener and Zofran for nausea from the pain meds. I take my next Percocet 8 hours later, then drift in and out of sleep. I then had some bone broth with more crackers later on that day. No pain all day today!Day 2 - Day after surgeryThe morning of day 2 is just like day 1. I wonder if I even had surgery, that’s how good I felt. I was able to get up and walk around and do some very light housework. I felt like I had to go to the bathroom, so I try for my first bowel movement that morning which is unsuccessful but not painful. I am noticing some gas and that if kinda just comes out on it’s own, but this is normal. I had some chicken and rice soup, of which I barely ate the rice. I also was able to take a shower, which felt really amazing. I am still taking Percocet every 6 hours but find I am often counting down until the next one as the day goes on. Take the pain pills if you are able, trust me. This is no time to be a tough guy!I tried two more times today to have a BM with no luck, but very little pain. I think the fear of pain was keeping me from going.I ate some miso soup, and I then ate some more chicken soup and crackers. I also ate an avocado to try and get some fiber. I managed to have an extremely pathetically small BM towards the end of the day. It was a victory though! I ended up having the BM in the Sitz bath, but honestly, no shame at this point.Then right before bed I started to develop really bad neck and abdominal muscle pain. Like you get after a really hard workout x20. No fever, so it’s only what I assume is post surgery soreness. This was the worst of it so far, and Percocet only helped a little. Eventually I was able to go to sleep.Day 3In the morning I had a successful BM with no pain! It was runny and only partially solid, but my surgeon said that was probably a good way to have them for the first week or so. I was so nervous about pain but I just let nature do it’s thing and didn’t force it. Kinda just let it “fall” out of you if you can and it’ll be a much better time.Still having the neck and abdominal pain, but nothing too terrible. The Percocet every 6 hours is still greatly appreciated but I can see myself not needing it soon.I will continue to keep this updated! All in all, probably max 4.5/10 on the pain scale so far, and mainly from the body soreness!"

I had my first one in December 2018 and it was, as expected, pretty uncomfortable but not unbearable. I decided to do it because I had a lump that came out after every BM, plus all the other pretty symptoms of hemorrhoids: itching, burning, clear leakage (not much but bothersome) and sometimes blood. After two months I had a second ligation and for a while all was well. This lasted for about 4 months, then the symptoms returned. Not as bad as before but enough to convince me it was time to make another appointment. I had my third ligation on Nov. 26 so now it is the second day after the procedure. The doctor snapped at least 6 bands in there even if he told me I just had minor hemorrhoids. The day of the procedure was painful and I did not get any sleep. The first day after, the pain had subsided and I could sit and go to work. I had a BM with some blood but it was not painful. Just a bit uncomfortable. Now, on the second day, I feel like a bump or something has formed. It is not on the outside but almost. Is it a new hemorrhoid that formed because the procedure went wrong??? Also, I have this almost constant feeling of having some discharge down there. I did not have this before the procedure or after the first and second banding. Is it normal or part of the healing process?This is new for me. It would help me to know what you went through. I am so disappointed and now I think I should not have done it. It is affecting my confidence and morale . I hope to hear from you guys. Thank you so much."

I was told the pain was going to be pretty bad. I was in outpatient surgery got done with surgery about 9 o'clock in the morning. I had the spinal block so I had to wait for my legs to come back and be able to walk. I did not pee after surgery before they let me go home. I got home and it was about 1:30 p.m. Before I left I told them that I had pressure and it felt like I had to pee but I couldn't. So as I am home I was in and uncomfortable state with my rectum still being quite numb and feeling all of the pressure. I did not pee at home when the spinal wore off. I had such bad pressure I could not pass gas and I could not pee. It felt like as if everything was pulsating and spasming. I ended up trying to call the hospital or clinic, because they told me if my pain was unbearable to call or if I hadn't peed by 3 p.m. I called them 21 times, turns out their phones were out from some technical issue. Of course that caused a state of panic like no other. I ended up going back in, which is a 30 minute drive. my mother was driving, now mind you she's in her early 60's. she was going 80 mph! Yes 80!! I told her that we would be in a world of hurt if we got into an accident or pulled over. I must have scared her with my pain reaction, I can usually handle it pretty good. We ended up in the waiting room for 1 hour before what I feel may have been the devil talking to the receptionist about stopping this God awful pain. I was admitted overnight for observation and pain management. Turned out that I had all kinds of trapped gas in my rectum, causing all that pressure, and definitely all the pain (at the time). They gave me morphine and I hated it. I felt it made me high versus take my pain away. Someone in the middle of the night I had them stop the morphine and figure out something else. They actually gave me anxiety medication, which relaxed me enough to pass gas. There was so much trapped in there, if a nurse would have walked in, I'd have probably blown her away. I might also mention I was not able to urinate on my own, the nurse ended up having to straight cath me. I was however able to in the morning. I waited to make sure the regiment of medicine I was on was working before they sent me home. I had bowel movements every single day since surgery. on day 3 post surgery I had to go to the bathroom. Now I had been drinking metamucil, and taking stool softeners more than recommended because of my history with pain medicine causing constipation. I had that heavy feeling in my rectum, my stomach was in knots, and the urge to have a bowel movement was so strong. I prepared my bottles of water, a cool wet paper towel to hold on my rectum after my BM, had my creams ready. I can tell you that I was not prepared enough for what was coming next. My body forced this bowl movement out. It was much more firm than others have been. This was by far the most painful thing I have ever been through in my entire life. Now mind you, I've had several surgeries prior to this. This bowl movement felt like my entire rectum was being ripped apart. I almost passed out from the pain and may have spoken a foreign language I didn't know I could. I screamed, I gritted my teeth, I wad in full body tremors. I was terrified of the damage done. While ugly crying I got up and turned the shower head on, held that sucker there for as long as I could tolerate. I dried off and pt my creams on, ran to my medicine, took my pain relievers and laid on my couch and cried. The worst wasn't over yet though, I had to go again. I WAS TERRIFIED! I drank a little coffee, tons of water, ate popsicles, and literally prayed. Now I am not a church goer, but I do believe in the big guy upstairs. I never really pray, but let me tell you... I PRAYED! Here I am sitting on the toilet in permission for my second SWEET HOLY MOTHER OF GOD moment. Well I can tell you, it was bad. Not as bad as the first time, but still very painful. With this one though, there wasn't more waiting at the exit. Because of my intake of liquids and such, it came flying out like a rocket ship, again there was no control. Now it being the day after my horrible bathroom experience, I have diarrhea almost. By bumhole feels very raw, and it burns like the depths of Hell are vacationing in my rectum. I am feeling quite regretful if this surgery at this moment. I'm fearful that I have undone some of what was done, as if maybe some stitches had torn or something. I have more blood than I did the day of surgery. It's not a lot, but still more, probably twice the amount. I am wondering if there were similar situations and everything turned out ok. I feel like this is never gluing to end."

I am a 44 year old male approaching the end of the third week post op for 3rd degree hemmeroids. I had become borderline 4th degree which prompted the move toward a more permanent resolution of symptoms. In total two hemmeroids were removed, another was ligated (falling out a few hours after the op) and a fourth injected. The following suggestions are made based on my experience of managing the condition over a few decades and undergoing the above procedure.For reference I was at the 3rd degree for 10-15 years and had become quite comfortable with it. I had and have what I would describe as a healthy diet living without red meats since the initial reports of BSE in the early 90's. Processed and prepared food forms the minority of my intake. Occasional itching would annoy me and manual reinsertion would occur once or twice a month often less, with no problem. I found that Calcium Fluoride (Calc Fluor) pillules were extremely effective in reducing symptoms and general management of symptoms. I also noticed it working for friends and acquaintances I recommended it to. Calc Fluor is a skin salt which it is said increases the elasticity of the veins. However changes in European Law made off the shelf supply illegal last year (2013) and so I had to resort to asking a naturopath chemist to make up a prescription. This inconvenience contributed to my 4th degree episode which I think was triggered by accidentally consuming a more than usual amount of chili powder. Oven baked chili powder lends a wonderful aroma and warm taste to food. Unfortunately I failed to notice how much I had sprinkled on my lunch one time and to make matters worse sort of inhaled it through my mouth which resulted in a bit of a coughing. The next morning symptoms reached what I understand are the 4th degree and I spent a very uncomfortable hour or so wrestling myself back to 3rd base. That was the last straw.Following a GP and referral appointment I opted for surgery after it became clear my piles would not clear up on their own. I did not consider any kind of manual/physical plug device. It was not suggested to me and I don't believe it is available on the NHS. You may wish to investigate this yourself before opting for surgery. I did and here are my suggestions to anyone undergoing surgery:3 - 5 days before your procedure you need to begin preparations for taking at least 2 - 3 weeks off work and off your feet (depending on the severity of your condition). If you intend or have no choice but to recover on your own or will have someone around to nurse you, either way I would recommend:1) you stock up on soup and yoghurt and also get in the bare essentials I have suggested above. If you can make your own soup that is excellent. I suggest you add the turmeric (teaspoon to each serving). It's very good for the gut. Plain or flavoured yoghurt is good either way - try and go for live culture yoghurt. You'll be on fairly strong antibiotics for about a week and will need all the help you can get bringing your stomach flora back up to healthy levels.2) if you can find or make a comfy place for yourself to lay down and rest close to your bathroom do it. Ideally this will be off the floor - perhaps a couch or similar can be temporarily moved into place.3) about 3 days before the op start taking the Ortisan (go from a 1/2 to a full one) and reducing the size of your meals. Porridge with fruit and nuts is a great food for keeping you going throughout a day. Perhaps also switch to eating mixed salads, cottage cheese etc as an evening meal. I would suggest upping your water intake and get your gut moving soft and strain free stools. Your energy levels may alter a little which is to be expected. You basically want to reduce the volume of your stools down IMHO. The opiates you'll receive during the op will slow you right down anyway so you want to make life easier for yourself once you wake up.4) try and time your last bowel movement to just before you go under. This is perhaps more a matter of luck but if you can get into a predictable rhythm in the days running up to your op it will help. Certainly you may not want to eat anything after 10pm the night before if you are expected to be in the ward early the next day.5) after you wake up and before you leave the recovery ward ask yourself how much pain you can feel. If it feels like someone may have just kicked you hard in the backside and or between the legs ask the nurse for a shot of morphine. If you are firm and polite you'll be given a dose orally. This will dull the pain a bit and help spin the first day out. As a result I left the ward when it closed at 8pm. If you are doing this on your own you may want to opt to stay over for the night. This is in your patient rights but will doubtless involve a hassle of changing wards so I wouldn't recommend it. So long as you pee before you go home they will let you go. Don't expect a BM anytime soon. Check that you leave with some lactulose and movicol in your set of meds. If you are there all day, as I was, take some lactulose while you are there. Later I combined this with the Ortisan to no ill effect and I wouldn't have minded starting that sooner rather than later. In retrospect I would have taken it in the run up to the op. Nb: The lactulose/movicol and Ortisan (fig and senna) work in different ways. Once you have been awake for a 5-7 hours if not sooner start sipping water. You need a minimum of 2L per day. Just try and relax.6) once home resist the urge to resume food intake at anything like your normal level. If you haven't already searched YouTube for hemmeroidectomy and watched a few ops do so now. It will help you understand the process of recovery you are about to undergo. Don't bother removing the wadding taped to your backside for 12-24 hours, you will be seeping mix of blood mucus and faeces in reducing amounts for a while. After I removed it I switched to toilet paper (changed every few hours) for the first 3-5 days then onto cotton wools pleats for the remainder as the flow decreased.7) you might want to have enquired with your surgeon how he/she operated. Mine used a laser to cauterise the wound but others may use staples. This perhaps depending on the health authority etc. Either way won't make much difference - you will be advised not to push afterward. Listen to that advice. Since pushing will probably have got you into this position this may be a bit difficult sensation to fight. I didn't have a BM until day 4 or 5. The anxiety attached to this is most of the problem. If you are male your pain and stress management will need to take into account that the prostate gland is very close to where your surgeon will have been 'rummaging around'. You may be well advised to google the location of your prostate if you are not aware of its location. I'm sure the prostate isn't used to any sort of contact similar to that resulting from such an op. So it is understandable that it will ache. It sits in a nerve plexus which will undoubtedly be traumatised from the pushing pulling etc of the hospital team. I found that much of the discomfort I felt resulted from this area more so than my anus. There being little or no nerve endings inside the gut seemed to support this. In any event for the first two weeks peeing, farting and defecating all felt equally painful.8) I only started taking the Ortisan 4-5 days after the op once I remembered its beneficial effects. I was not impressed with either movicol or lactulose. Although they do soften the stool. They don't work on relaxing the muscle as Ortisan's main ingredients do. They can also be a bit acidic. I took them both together as mentioned to no bad effect. By day four I was googling about first BM as I was getting concerned after moving up to 6 movicol per day without any result. Your first BM can become a bit of a focus. By this time I was taking a lot of full and sits baths with the water really quite warm. I was also using the shower head to direct a jet of water on to my perineum. This seemed to counter act the pain and reduced my discomfort immensely. My first BM was taken laying in the bath with a warm jet relaxingly directed around my aching sphincter. I am not ashamed to say the plug was in and I had already urinated. It was fairly vocal too but by that time I was past caring and I was in the best place to get cleaned up afterward. This was where the little plastic bowl came in handy. If you live in a tiny flat as I do, you will probably find you can easily gather up your turd in the bowl and transfer it to the loo while still in your bath. If not then you'll need to make other arrangements. TBH having to poop on the loo was impossible so I jettisoned my pride and got down to it in my bath. Things can be worse.9) live in the bath. Water, the shower head and the little bowl are your friends. By the end of the first week I was taking 3-4 bath/showers a day and spent upwards of 8 hours in the bath (feet out, thighs and backside submerged) at a time. I definitely needed the extra towels. Soup and yogurt were my dietary staple. Thankfully I had an iPad and could watch TV and movies in the bath. When I got a bit better I would pee in the bowl and empty it into the WC thus changing the water and cleaning myself and the bath less often. 10) moving out of the bath took about 10 days maybe more and I often returned for soothing douches after a BM, fart or pee. I was eating soups and yoghurt but only a carton of each per day with a multivit, yakult and Ortisan once a day too. I found laying on my back and peddling my legs helpful. It exercises/massages the bowel and sphincter a bit and if you put something soft under the base of you spine it can be done in the bath to help a BM in the early days too.11) During week 2, I rediscovered arnica in gel form. This really helped in untangling and soothing the jangle of nerves under my perineum. These nerves appear in Grays to surround the prostate and seem definitely connected to the area that was operated on. The arnica feels a bit similar to Deep Heat (another preparatory ointment) but is much less aggressive. I cannot recommend the later but the arnica, despite an initially overly warm sensation, gave out a lasting, comforting and restful glow and helped the nerves down there re distinguish different sensations. This helped me manage the discomfort associated to the op. 12) by the start of week 2 I was so clean that my nose had become quite sensitive to the certain smells. So whenever I was out of the bath I would but some bleach down the plug hole making sure to flush water down when I came to go back in. I was also using a slightly perfumed body lotion just to make things smell even more rosey. Having a shave after a while helped me feel normal. If you are on your own you want to have frozen soups stocked up (at least 14-21 cartons split between the fridge and freezer and also an equal amount of yoghurt. Don't worry too much about eating more than that every day - you won't expire and basically will want to rest your bowel while keeping it 'ticking over' as you heal up. Being on your feet for any amount of time may seem out of the question as it was for me. Peddling on your back with your feet in the air helps, as did short walks around the flat. Putting you legs and feet up above the level of your heart/shoulders will also help reduce the throbbing as can shoulder stands if you are able. Once in a shoulder stand peddling and splaying your legs and other slow movements can help reacquaint your body with itself. 13) hopefully by the end of week 3 you'll be very firmly back to pretty much normal. Pooping may still likely sting and may need to be followed by a bit of aqua therapy courtesy of the shower head and a warm jet on the perineum or a hot sits bath. As the anaesthetic and morphine can take upwards of a week to leave your system the nature of your stools, which may as I have said can become a bit of an obsession, will probably be stiff or impacted at the front. As a result they stay intact when they are in water. This makes removing them to the WC via the bowl a fairly easy task. You may find, particularly if you start taking the Ortisan earlier than I did, that this isn't the case. When it started working on me there was a noticeable difference to the structure of my poop and using the WC became preferable. If you have seen the movie Shawshank Redemption you may find yourself relating deeply to the lead character by this time but remember freedom awaits. Sorry if that's a spoiler for you.14) take the pain killers (I had codydramol) as long as you feel like it. TBH the codeine part seemed to slow my gut so you may not find it helps across the board. It's pain relieving effects were not a patch on the either the immediacy of a hot bath/warm jet of water or the comfort of the arnica gel but it obviously comes down to personal experience. Try and stay away from overly acidic fruit such as oranges for example as these can sting a little. By e/o week 3 you should be alright on your feet for short lengths of time but don't expect much. If you have to go out perhaps take a folding stool. You may also, again depending on the legislation where you live, find that vaporised THC helps you manage your levels of pain. Despite such issues I found its effect quite extraordinary and would place it well above the warm bath/shower/arnica. However having a range of options is best and vaporising THC does require specific equipment and a certain amount of pharmacological deregulation.15) in a short addendum to the above: women may find the use of arnica gel around the perineum uncomfortable due to proximity of the lady garden. However I think in such cases its use may be unnecessary due to the physiological differences between the sexes. In particular the absence of a prostate type gland that close to the area operated on. In my experience the connection of this gland to my gonads played a significant part in understanding and managing the level of pain I experienced. Either way, who ever and whatever you are, try and keep your environment as calm and as quiet and relaxed as possible with little or no unexpected visitors for at least 2 weeks. Be patient with yourself and those around you. Keep away from processed foods like bread and sweets although an occasional bit of chocolate and spoon of ice cream will be a welcome treat. Find a bunch of books and stuff to do while you are flat out for a fortnight, an iPad or tablet PC makes for a great distraction. Remember don't really contemplate driving for a week and learn not to push going forward. As of now I think I am definitely out of the woods so I am relaying my experience. If you have sudden bleeding of course contact your doctor or go to A&E immediately. This is unlikely, because the success rate of this type of op is so high you will need to be a fool or have desperately poor karma for things to go bad. Chin up, keep smiling. It will be a memory soon.I hope this helps you get through a fairly stressful experience quickly. Bon fortune.X"

"Piles","Involuntary and Frequent bowel movements after hemorrhoidectomy","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/involuntary-and-frequent-bowel-movements-after-hemorrhoidectomy-728440","Hi all, it has been helpful to read your experiences after a hemorrhoidectomy. 12 days ago, i had an open Milligan-Morgan surgery to remove my grade 4 thrombosed hemorrhoids. The pain on the first day during a bowel movement was off the chart, as if you are pushing into someone stabbing your butthole. The worst was that with the stool softeners and fiber supplements my doctor was prescribing, i had to do frequent BMs. And since each BM is so painful, only a little can be pushed out each time so i guess i had to go more often. the first few days were truly the worst, and it took me an hour to recover from each BM.i have a new problem now. since the 10th day post-op, i have had to do BMs very regularly. sometimes it is when i need to pee and other times it is just a strong urge to go. i thought i was constipated because not much was coming out and i had stopped the stool softeners because i felt i was going to the toilet so regularly already. i was going like 8 times in a day, and each time the involuntary bowel spasms were really strong, making me push hard.I went to see my doctor to see if i needed an enema, which he was reluctant to prescribe. he said that i should just use the stool softeners and fiber supplement. he suggested it could be tenesmus, which is when there is an urge to go even if the bowel is empty. i suppose with the rectum being inflamed after the surgery, this could be the reason. has anyone here gone through a similar experience? it would be helpful to know how long this period will last as it is so exhausting to have to live tied to the bathroom. thanks."

"Piles","Hemorrhoidectomy Post-Op","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hemorrhoidectomy-post-op-728396","Sharing here since I know everyone's experiences are vastly different, and are very individual to the person. I've seen plenty of horror stories, but I wanted to share my not-so-horrific experience with my hemorrhoidectomy (so far). Reading the horror stories gave me fear and anxiety, but I now have my own experience to share and I hope it helps you make an informed decision if you are considering this procedure.BACKGROUNDI'm a 29 year old female, 5'4"" and 130 lbs. Very healthy overall. I eat clean 90% of the time and I workout at the gym (mostly weight and resistance training) 5-6 days per week. I rarely get sick and I consider myself to be a healthy and active individual.HISTORYI had irritable bowels throughout my childhood. My sensitivity to food has decreased with age, and I can now tolerate more foods in moderation (e.g. dairy products). My hemorrhoid issues started during my training for a marathon. I completed the marathon, but suffered from thrombosed hemorrhoids and an anal fissure as a result of all the stress and pressure I but my body through. Blood covered and filled the toilet bowl when I went. The night after I completed my marathon, I cried myself to sleep due to the pain. I was too embarrassed and too scared to see a doctor for my issues. At the time, I was living alone in NYC and did not have any family or friends to take care of me if I needed a serious procedure. This is NOT an excuse. If you are suffering, please seek medical aid immediately and DO NOT wait like I did. I probably could have avoided so much pain, discomfort, and complications if I had taken care of it long ago. After a couple of weeks, the swelling eventually decreased, but I was left with chronic hemorrhoids and an anal fissure that would open at any point in time, no matter how much fiber or how good my diet was. My anal fissure would open simply walking around in heels for a night, passing normal gas, or simply just urinating. My hermorrhoids would swell after every single bowel movement, and would stay swollen for 2-3 hours afterward. I would have to tough it out and go to the gym with swelling every morning.A couple of years later, I had a parasitic infection in my stomach, and was frequenting the bathroom 5-6 times per day. My hemorrhoids and fissure were causing me so much pain, I went to the urgent care clinic. My infection was eventually resolved with some strong antibiotics, but it was the final push I needed to demand a solution from my gastroenterologist. He had previously put me on a regiment of sits baths, enemas, and procto-foam with no results or progression in my healing for two weeks. After my parasite infection was resolved, he referred me to a colorectal surgeon. I needed 2 tags removed from the outside, and 1 from the inside (prolapsed). He also suggested botox for my anal fissure.WEEK OF SURGERYMy doctor had me take 1 dose of Miralax each day for 5 days leading up to the surgery. I also fit in as much fiber as I could within my diet (e.g. dark greens like spinach and kale). I continued my normal routine, other than having an IUD placed 3 days before my surgery. IUD insertion pain is the WORST. I felt like crying, vomiting, and passing out all at once while I had it done. It is NOT pleasant, but the pain is temporary. I was feeling mostly normal (with a tiny amount of soreness) the day of my hemorrhoidectomy surgery.DAY OF SURGERYI stopped eating at 2PM the prior day (did not feel like eating dinner, maybe because of nerves), and I stopped drinking water at midnight. Following my doctor's orders, I used a saline enema the morning of my surgery, and only had small sips of water before my procedure. After all of the pre-checks and IV, they brought me to the OR. In the OR, the doctor had me lay on my stomach with a cushion under my hips, and with my feet elevated. I was actually really comfortable and fell asleep almost immediately with sedated local anesthesia. I woke up in the recovery room, feeling ""pressure"" and soreness, but definitely not bad. They had me snack on ginger ale and saltine crackers to make sure I was not nauseous from the anesthesia. They also had me urinate (which was easy) and shortly after they discharged me. My fiance drove me home and also picked up my prescriptions for me. Once I got home, I felt sleepy but did not feel the need to nap. I still felt pressure, but was not uncomfortable. I did not need to take any medication the day of the surgery. I did however keep my foods very light. I had soup and crackers for lunch, and a spinach + fruit smoothie for dinner. I did not have any trouble walking around, though standing for too long gave me slight discomfort. I went to bed with a slight urge to have a bowel movement, but my doctor STRONGLY recommended to wait the day after surgery to go again.DAYS AFTER SURGERYFirst day post-surgery, I woke up around 5am since the urge to go had become stronger. I used a sits bath on the toilet, and then proceeded with my bowel movement after. There was some slight pain, probably a 3 on a scale of 1-10, but I was able to go. It was not any worse than the pain I had already experienced living with hemorrhoids and an anal fissure. I took a warm bath immediately afterward, and started my medication regiment of a strong ibuprofen every 6 hours, and pain pill every 4 hours. I had heard from others to ""stay ahead of the pain"" so I took the medication even though I was feeling quite good. I also followed my doctor's orders for taking Metamucil 3x per day (followed immediately with 8 ounces of water), Miralax 1x per day, and 3x sits baths for 15 minutes each. I kept my food light again, and made sure to eat veggies, fruits, and whole-grain carbs. Throughout the day, I had some VERY slight discomfort, but did not find it unbearable or painful. Still walking around fine, and can stand longer without discomfort. I woke up sometime during the night to keep up with my normal schedule of medication.The second day post-surgery was more or less the same. I tried to stop the pain medication, but felt too much ""throbbing"". It was more annoying than it was painful, so I continued with the pain medication. I followed the same regiment as the first day. I incorporated more normal foods into my diet. The pain medication made me sleepy, so I toke one or two naps throughout the day.The third day post-surgery, I woke up from a very restful sleep (slept the whole night through 5am) without any pain or discomfort. Followed my normal routine of a bowel movement in the morning, followed by a 15 minute sit in the tub and then a shower. Following the same medication routine, although I find myself going longer without it. I went for a walk around the block and had breakfast at one of favorite cafes. Slight discomfort while walking but definitely manageable. Again, this discomfort and pain does not compare to the pain I went through previously in my life with my anal fissure and other issues.CURRENTI am so happy that I went through with this procedure. I am kicking myself for putting it off for so long, and for letting the horror stories alter my perception of what could happen. The truth is that you don't know what will happen, or how it will go. But I knew that I wanted to be done with the continuous, daily pain. The pain and discomfort that I am going through right now (albeit with the aid of medication) does not hold a candle to the pain of my earlier IUD insertion. This hemorrhoidectomy has been SO worth it to me."

"Piles","External Thrombosed Hemorrhoids (Piles) - Pain & Bleeding","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/external-thrombosed-hemorrhoids-piles-pain-bleeding-624330","To give some context: I’m a 20 year old American male, I am very active and athletic, I’m in college right now as a nursing student, I’m a full-time firefighter/paramedic, and I’m assigned to the busiest fire station in the city. This plays a role later on. Here’s the entire story, little lengthy but I think it gives light to where I am now. Roughly 4 days ago I developed an external hemorrhoid. I’ve had internal and external before, but with relatively no pain and little-to-no blood. That morning, I went to the gym and did some power lifting, which I think may have been the instigator. Later that afternoon, I discovered it after a bowel movement, but there wasn’t any blood or pain associated with it, just a small (about peanut sized) lump. Didn’t think much of it, figured it would go away like the others have in the past. Fast forward a few hours after I discovered it, (late in the evening around 10pm), I began to feel some pain, but it was more annoying and uncomfortable that an actual ‘hurting pain’. The next day, I woke up in a world of hurt. I examined the area, where I discovered that the previously peanut-sized external hemorrhoid had doubled in size and had a small dark blue/purple mark on it. I still didn’t have any bleeding, just excruciating pain. That is when I realized it had become a Thrombosed External Hemorrhoid. I soaked in a warm bath for 10 minutes, cleaned the best I could with some wet tissues, applied a generous amount of the prep H cream, took ibuprofen and an ambien and passed out for the next 6 hours (I obviously wasn’t going to class). When I woke up, the pain had decreased, but still hurt a good bit. I soaked in the tub, and repeated the process from earlier, minus the ambien. The next day I had to go to work at the fire department (24 hour shifts, 7am to 7am, every third day, so I have 48 hours off before I go back on shift), so I repeated the process later that night and went to bed feeling a little better. When I woke up I felt some pain but nothing compared to the day before. Went to work, ran a decent amount of emergency calls throughout the day, nothing too strenuous, but the pain had begun to get worse as I was constantly moving. After we got back to the station from a call late in the evening, I went to the dormitory and laid down and tried my best to relieve the pain. It hurt to move any direction, and shortly thereafter we got a house fire call. Long story short, I thought I was going to die, it felt like my anus was a propane tank on fire and was going to explode. By the time we got back to the station I was in unbearable pain. I took a shower and that’s when I noticed a some blood on my boxers. Fast forward to the next morning, I didn’t sleep at all that night, and the pain had gotten unimaginably worse. As soon as I got home I took off my clothes and that’s when I saw that I had bled through my uniform. I soaked in the bath, cleaned with wet tissues, applied prep-H, iced for 20 minutes, took ibuprofen, then placed some gauze in the region and got in bed. Woke up a few hours later to find that the bleeding had slowed a lot, and my pain had decreased significantly. I did the whole regimen once again, and honestly felt pretty good. It didn’t hurt at all moving around, just a slight annoying feeling. Then, I had a bowel movement. I thought I was going to have to summon a priest, some of the worst pain I have had since this ordeal started. My stool was relatively normal, not hard or loose, and I had a fat bright red blood clot sitting on top. I sneezed in the middle of it and was almost certain I shot my lower intestines out of my body. I couldn’t wipe, so I resorted to the shower and those wet tissues to clean, and did the same regimen as before, and it seemed like in 30-45 minutes my pain was almost gone. Since I have final exams next week, I have to//NEED to study. So I have to sit at my desk for long periods of time. I had no pain sitting for the first few hours, and the bleeding was there but almost nonexistent. Fast forward 6-7 hours later (I got up a few times and walked around) I felt that annoying pain again and discovered I had bled through my clothes once again. Now, it has been 12 hours since then, pain is the same, and I’m still bleeding. I’m a paramedic, and a nursing student, I’m well aware of what can happen if bleeding persists. But it’s not a lot, just enough to be slightly concerning when combined with the fact it hasn’t stopped in about 18 hours despite my efforts. I looked online and there’s next to nothing about thrombosed external hemorrhoids bleeding, aside from a few mentions about if they aren’t treated by a doctor with a small incision to remove the clot, they will resolve themselves by popping. Has anyone had an experience like this? If you’ve had a thrombosed external hemorrhoid, how did you treat it? How long did the bleeding last? How long did it take the pain to go away completely? How much bleeding is too much? Those who had to sit for long periods of time and/or be active, what did you do to manage this? I’m past the window my doctor could do anything so I haven’t bothered with him, plus with final exams and work, I don’t have time to be out for Even just one day now. I have work tomorrow, and I need this to be resolved. Specifically the pain and bleeding, moreso the bleeding. Any advice or personal insight/opinion is 100% welcome and a big thanks to those in advance that will reply. "

I have been suffering from what I like to call ""asstroids"" for roughly 10 years.... getting increasingly worse every year. I had a traditional external hemorrhoidectomy 6 years ago. MOST PAINFUL THING IN THE WORLD. But, it took care of the problem.... until the internal ones showed up. The internal ones are literally trying to kill me. I was hospitalized and given two units of blood 4 years ago for them. Grade 3. Was told the only thing that will work is surgery. I never want to experience that pain again, so I've said ""no thanks"" every time. But, now that they have been ruining my life for my entire motherhood, i've agreed to surgery in the middle of August 2019..... but I don't plan on keeping the appointment. Mostly because I have to go back to work shortly after (i'm a teacher). And I know I won't be moving out of bed for at least 2 weeks if I have the surgery. So, my only option right now is to completely overhaul my life and do a major hyper focus on my asstroids.I'm sick of having to carry around rubber gloves to push them back in.... either after a bowel movement or in the bathroom at the grocery store because they slipped out while grocery shopping or while at work when I finally get some time without my students. Currently, the only thing that helps even a tiny bit is rolling up some toilet paper and sticking it in my crack to attempt to hold them in. Sometimes it works great, other times not so much. Either way, my life completely revolves around this issue. Saying no to surgery might be the dumbest thing in the world. But I'm going to try my best to make life at least livable.I've done banding, electrocuting them (not sure what the medical term is for when they shock them), creams, ointments, physical therapy, fiber, supplements, yada yada yada. Everything. Has. Been. Tried. But i feel like maybe I went half assed. I'm done half-assing it. I'm ready to Bruice Willis and Ben Afflec these MFers Armageddon style.I can't have a normal bowel movement. It's like I'm pushing against a brick wall. Even when I have a stomach bug, getting anything to come out is sometimes impossible. That results in more time on the s*****r, which results in more problems, which makes having a bm harder, and the cycle continues.So, here's my game plan:Supplements: vitamin e (supposedly helps protect cells from damage), collagen (Collagen is the most abundant protein in your body. it supports skin elasticity and holds your organs, muscles, and bones together... so hoping it helps my bum too). Probiotic (because it's good for your gut), folic acid to help my body make new cells, iron to help the constant blood loss, vitamin c to help the iron, and b12 to help my blood cells. I've also ordered a spendy supplement meant to help hems. We'll see.I'm also going to start juicing. Celery juice craze... i'm gonna jump on the band wagon. Probably won't help, but I'm willing to try anything to get my life back!I'm going to go get them shocked more too. The only reason I don't do this more often is because, even though it reduces their size, it makes me bleed like crazy.I am fully aware that this might be a lost cause. I'm 99% sure I'll be going in for the surgery once school is out for next summer. But at least if that happens I can say i did everything i could to avoid it."

I was told that the dressing inside of me had to come out the next day before I left the hospital and that it is going to hurt when they pull it out. I was TERRIFIED!17th DecemberI woke up around 4 AM so the nurse could check my vitals. A few seconds later I was in extreme pain. I felt like I needed to have a BM. I kept calling the nurse and begging them to take it out. She made me do a sitz bath and after she pulled the dressing out I WAS DYING. Pain 10/10!!! I was discharged after HALLELUJAH! My dad drove me home.When I got home I don't remember what I did. All I remember was taking my liquid paraffin as prescribed by my doctor and around 6pm I needed to have a BM. So I locked the bathroom doors, sat on the toilet and DIED. My BM was super hard and painful. 10/10 for sure. I called my mom and told her I needed to faint. But because I locked the doors she could not get to me. After what felt like an eternity she found the keys and I was so close to passing out. All I remember was my mom and sister trying their best to keep me awake. I was in so much pain. They gave me Tramacet (prescribed by doctor) while I was on the toilet and after I went to bed. I remember NOTHING.18thI have no recollection of this day. PAIN!19thI had 2 BMs and after screaming and bawling I fainted...both times. Pain level 10/10. Guys...my mom, sister, aunt, cousin and brother did everything they could to help me while I was on the toilet passed out. It was so hard to breathe and I was in a lot of pain. My mom had to shower me because I was way too weak. After the first BM my mom called the doctor and he said to give me 15 mls of Lactulose daily.20thGUESS WHO FAINTED AGAIN BUT THIS TIME I WAS STANDING AFTER MY BM. The pain was 9/10. Still taking lactulose and liquid paraffin. Watching so many Christmas movies DREADING having to have a BM. (And I go twice a day but luckily I went once today)21st-25thI don't remember much. But my BM kept hurting and would be a bit difficult to come out (no fainting though ONLY SCREAMING AND CRYING!!!!) so I emailed my doctor and asked him what to do. He recommended I increase my fluid intake and stick to my high fiber diet. I already drink a lot of water so I found it odd that I had to drink even more. I found it easier to have a BM in the sitz bath with warm water. It still hurts don't get me wrong but the pain decreases from 10 to 9. I took a second dose of lactulose before bed to see if it would help my morning BM. OH BOY! NO IT DID NOT!26thHELL. ON. EARTH. I woke up and immediately ran to the bathroom. Filled my sitz bath and emptied my bowels. Now at this point my mom is very sick so I am basically on my own. It hurt like 6/10. I took a shower and had some oatmeal. GUESS WHAT!!! I had to go again. 6/10 again. I was praying I did not have diarrhea. I kept going. GOING AND GOING. Pain dropped to a 2/10 because I was passing water. Doctor told me to stop the lactulose and liquid paraffin and increase my fluids. After having over 10 BMs the pain increased to 8/10 because now I am SORE and everything burns.

No more running & dancing, no days out & about, a holiday cancelled, limited daily walks and just being stuck at home.

"Piles","Rubber Band Ligation!","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/rubber-band-ligation--707348","I just underwent my first rubber band ligation for one of three internal hemorrhoids this morning. I've seen some horror stories on this site, and I want to offer my experience as it's been quite well. The procedure went smoothly, my Dr. applied lidocaine and jelly and put the band on. I felt it and it was slightly painful for a second, but after that I was fine. I did have some burning for about an hour or so after the procedure but I believe it was due to the lidocaine. Either that or it's the hemorrhoid and the Tylenol I took just took the pain away. Anyways, I am about 2 and a half hours after the procedure now and I feel fine. I am lying down for the rest of the day and eating a lot of fiber and drinking lots of water. I honestly was terrified this morning because I've read so many bad things about this procedure but all in all my experience is a 9/10 so far. I had the CRH-OREGAN disposable hemorrhoid banding procedure. I highly recommend this for anyone that has it available to them. I have not had a bowel movement yet but I honestly don't feel it's going to be an issue because I don't feel any pain right now. I will keep updating this thread as I go."

Sharing experience to help!.","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hemorrhoidectomy-sharing-experience-to-help--719382","So today is 3 weeks one day after my closed hemorrhoidectomy. I had 3 internal and I guess a couple external ones that were always visible. I have been suffering with this for about 17 years and would not have done this procedure at all if it didn't become an emergency. Last year around June (2018), I started bleeding whenever I had a BM. Sometimes a great deal of bright red blood, sometimes a little and sometimes not at all. I tried to adjust diet, water intake, added fiber (benefibre) and a number of other ""at home fixes,"" but nothing seemed to work. By October I was a bleeding quite heavily and finally decided to go to the hospital because of light headedness. I was advised to do scerlotherapy which are injections into the actual hemorrhoid that slowly kill blood vessels. I was happy and though it did hurt quite a bit, I was back to work in 2 weeks and bleeding subsided over time. A few months later... the nightmare bleeds restarted and by mid 2019 I was bleeding regularly and heavily yet again. I visited a other doctor who immediately recommended surgery. I scheduled for october 23rd 2019 and went in with a very positive attitude. ONE PAIN and it'll be over! Boy was I wrong. Everyone's experience is different but I have been finding some similarities on this site that have really helped me. The actuam surgery went well and I was given pain killers shortly after I woke up which really helped into the night and next day. I was given paraffin oil to drink to keep stools soft. Day 3 is the first time I had to use the bathroom. The oil worked but the pain was incredible. After that experience, by own body refused to relax for any further movements and I became constipated. The next time I had a bm was 10 days post op! By then I was in so much discomfort, extreme pain and could not function properly. I was on a diet of mostly jell-o, occasional white bread and very light watery food since my surgeon suggested this soft diet for 10 days to keep things soft. I think this contributed to constipation and made things more difficult. The bm on the 10th day was painful and can be described as passing broken bottles and it hurt for hours after. Next bm was day 14 after a self administered enema. Saline was the wrong decision in retrospect as the salt burnt quite a bit. It is now day day 22 and though I am a little more regular, every bm hurts and hurts for hours after.A few things u want to mention:-I did use seits baths and though they helped I found icing to be more helpful...-the swollen skin tags that remain are ridiculously sensitive and painful. praying those deflate and ease soonplease comment and share your experiences so someone might find comfort or hope. looking forward to finishing healing and being done with this ordeal."

I had a HALO procedure just 17 Days ago and so far it's been a rough ride. I was given 5 days of AB's, Morphine as my pain killer and Ibuprofen and Paracetamol as a long term pain relief method.I saw a few old posts on here and I decided that I wanted to create an account just to get some information and perspective on my recovery.For the first 3 days after surgery I was not able to pass a BM and was worried about being constipated and that in turn causing more issues further down the line, I spoke to the nurses from the ward and they said that I should increase my Movicol intake to 3 packets a day, this helped get things moving and by the 7th or 8th day after surgery I was feeling great again, no pain everything was okay and best of all, my itching that was caused from the hems were gone.However I took a bad turn on the 11th day, I had a BM with a lot of blood in it which made me panic a little but ultimately I felt fine so I pressed on with my normal activities. As the week progressed, the pain that I had experienced after surgery reoccurred and I was once again constipated this carried on to the 14th day.On the 14th Day I visited my GP asking for a prescription of Movicol as I had unfortunately ran out at this point I also brought up the bleeding issue on the 11th Day but they were not worried and they had suspected that it was caused by a fissure. When I got back I had a BM and with no surprise, a lot of blood as well. Enough to make me feel uneasy about what was happening, I was a little shocked at this point and around 2 or 3 hours later that night I had 2 more consecutive BM's with nothing but blood. I panicked here. I went to A&E where bloods were taken and I was seen to by a surgical team, they examined me and were happy that nothing malicious was at work, they said it can be expected and my bloods came back fine, no sign of bleeding or anything else. They were happy to let me leave and go home and was told if I start to feel faint or dizzy come back.I arrived home and for the next 2 hours I experienced hell, I think I had about 10 BM's all accompanied with large amounts of blood and apart from the sheer amount of stress and anxiety that this had induced I felt fine, no light headiness or dizziness so I did not return to hospital.and then between then and now I've had a few small BM's with a bit of mucus and small amounts of blood, but the pain has increased a lot since then, in fact I would say the pain is worse now than when it was after surgery, I had a BM today with a fair bit of blood but nothing compared to the 14th day, pain is better during the day but at night it's awful.I was just curious if anyone can relate or provide some insight on my experience here?, I feel that if I wasn't better for those few days I would feel that what is happening now is normal but I'm worried that I've messed up somehow and caused more issues for myself. I kinda of feel like I'm never going to get better at this point and am just constantly stuck in a loop of anxiety and stress over the blood lossI will phone my doctor who carried out the surgery tomorrow since they're not in office today, just to ask a few questions and to see if it's normal.Thanks all!"

"Piles","Very Positive Hemorrhoidectomy/ Haemorrhoidectomy Recovery Story","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/very-positive-hemorrhoidectomy-haemorrhoidectomy-recovery-story-716861","After reading many stories of hemorrhoidectomy recovery, I promised myself that if my recovery was good, I would report back just to provide a balance, hope and perhaps ease some anxiety. I barely slept the week before my procedure because I was concerned about the pain, but I can honestly say that my entire experience was pain-free, and I do think there are steps that people can take replicate this.First, some background: healthy 42 year old female with 2 grade 4 prolapsed hemorrhoids, a grade 1-2 internal hemorrhoid and external hemorrhoids. I would say I have the normal pain tolerance of a female my age, that is, several decades of experience with period pain, pain associated with meeting western beauty standards, childbirth (needed epidurals), parenting through illness, etc. I had my surgery 2 weeks ago.Pain Management BEFORE SurgeryMy doctor had me begin Celebrex five days before surgery and Gabapentin two days before surgery, including an additional dose of Gabapentin right before surgery. Both drugs were then continued for a week post-surgery. The theory here is to block the nerve pathway before the pain starts - sort of blowing up a bridge before your enemy can cross it. Additionally, he injected a long-acting local anesthetic at surgery sites. Although I had a prescription for narcotics, I never took them as I never felt any pain.Obviously, everybody responds to drugs differently, but this pain regimen worked spectacularly well for me.Diet Pre- and Post-SurgeryMy diet is generally good anyway, I eat lots of home-cooked, minimally processed food. I also routinely drink 3-4 litres of water daily. 4 days before surgery, I limited myself to extremely soft food: essentially yogurt, cooked fruit and blended vegetable soups made with bone broth to keep protein high. The day before surgery, I switched to clear liquids and consumed only bone broth and water. After my surgery, I had only bone broth for the remainder of the day. For the next 3 days, it was back to blended soups, yogurt, etc. I added All-Bran to my morning fruit and yogurt to keep my fibre high and again focused on protein because your body needs protein for cell-repair. There was a lot of cell-repair going on, so this was a priority. I slowly returned to my regular diet over the following week.Never PushMy doctor stressed that I was to avoid straining at all costs. I am lucky enough to have a treadmill in the garage, so whenever I felt the need for a BM, I got on the treadmill and slowly walked until it was urgent, then got to the bathroom, feet up on the Squatty Potty and let gravity take care of matters. The one time I attempted to push a little was the first and only time I got a warning that pain would be imminent if I kept on that path.Thus ends my advice. I had my follow up with my doctor this morning and he has cleared me to begin regular exercise again. I do have some skin tags that will hopefully shrink and still have a little drainage and stitches are still dissolving.

I was schedule for rubber band procedure but my doctor opt to the cut off since they were too big (eternal and internal). I had try other options before opting for surgery such as drinking/eating fiber and not getting constipated. nothing worked. So opt for surgery. It has been the worst pain ever. I had a bowel movement on my third day-the worst pain ever-even passed out. the second day I had a bm and it as even worst. I got better the fourth day-walked- but then went downhill. The pain got worst and started getting pains in my lower back and the bone at the end does not allow me to sit well. I have three children and never felt such pain. I Have high tolerance for pain but this pain is awful. Oh caught a 102 fever after a week for two days and the pain medication that they prescribe for me was only good for 2 days. Ibuprofen (600mg) every 6 hours was my friend. I walked when my pain was not bad, shower 4-6 times a day cause even farting was bad and I had mucous and stool on my anus. Sitz bath with epsom salt was great. my behind felt like i fell and hit my bum every day. I was week and not still dont feel like myself. im afraid to even go out for a long period of time.worst pain of my life. would i recommend the surgery...right now because i am in so much pain no. maybe as my pain goes away I can say yes. I cant even sit for a long time without pain. i was to take a week off from work but took 3 weeks due to pain when sitting and have to run to the bathroom because I cant hold my bm.

The team said i would feel a little uncomfy when i woke up, i woke up in a lot of pain and was given tramadol that didn't do anything.I got sent home with high strength co codomal and naproxen which isn't strong but an anti inflammatory.I do have tramadol at home so instead of making myself constipated i took tramadol and naproxen.The first 2 days were painful, then day 3 and 4 arrived (day 4 today) and that's when i became in agony and the anesthetic had well and truly wore off.I struggle a lot with my bowels and i am always constipated. I had to go back to the hospital last night as i couldn't pass water or have a bowel movement, it got to 5 days with no bowel movement which even for me is too long so they did blood tests/urine sample (what i could produce) and I'm seeing my consultant thursday about what's been happening and see what pain relief he can give.My body can't deal with laxatives, normally they run out of me, not this time, in the space of 3 days i have taken 6 movicol, 3 fybogel, 8 senna tablets, ducolax and 2 lots of lactulose over a period of 15 hours and my consultant doubled the lactulose dose to try help so it would equal to 4 normal doses.I came to the toilet and passed a small bowel movement, the pain shot through me! I was screaming and crying rushing to get some pain relief down me. i instantly ran a sitz bath and I'm currently sat in it now knowing i need to empty the rest of my bowels but too scared to!i haven't been eating much and very tired from not sleeping but i do get a few hours in, just broken sleep.i am still struggling to pass water but better than i was, it's a common side effect.I don't mean to scare anyone, people have different stories, i had piles internal and external and also a very big skin tag that he removed.i stocked up on fruit and bought high fiber food that can help prevent constipation.Get yourself a sitz bath, they are a life saver and stops you running countless baths! i also bought a gel ice pack to put in the freezer.And just prepare yourself for the pain but it's on to the road of recovery!"

I have no doubt that my recovery would be entirely different have I not found this site. Yes, the horror stories were anxiety inducing but in the same time the tips shared and lessons learned were invaluable in my recovery so far. I hope by sharing my experience I can repay the favour and help someone else.The procedure: Colonoscopy + Hemorrhoidectomy (2x large grade IV hems excised) + pudendal nerve blockI am 10 days post op today. While my recovery is still very much a ‘work in progress’ it has so far been much better than I have anticipated.Surgery DayI went in at 3pm. I naively thought when I wake up I would be quite numb and not feel a thing. This wasn’t the case and I felt pain immediately after waking up. I told the nurse who gave me some painkiller through IV and Endone tablet. The pain was gone in an instant but the dose was too much as it left me extremely nauseous and light headed. At one point I didn’t think I would be able to leave the hospital and needed to stay overnight. Nurse gave me anti nausea through IV and I managed to eat some yoghurt and finally made it home about 8pm. Ate some soaked oats with banana and slept. Took 1x Panadeine Forte at 11pm as instructed by the nurse and slept through the night.Day 1Woke up 5:30am. I wasnt in too much pain maybe 2/10. Was able to get up, walk around (including many stairs) and cook porridge for breakfast. Took antibiotic and anti-inflammatory as prescribed. As I wasnt in much pain i decided to hold off with the painkiller despite the advice that’s best to take it regularly to stay ahead of the pain. I eventually took 1x Panadeine Forte around 2pm when the pain started increasing. Overall though the intensity on Day 1 didn’t reach more 5/10 and the 1 tablet was enough to bring it back down. I rested most of the day and slept through the night.Day 2Woke up @ 6am and again not much pain 2/10 so took only the antibiotic and anti-inflammatory. At 10.30am after coffee I almost immediately felt the urge. The dreaded first BM! It was small and loose and surprisingly painless while coming out. Only once finished that’s when the pain increased dramatically. Took 1x Panadeine Forte and straight into the hot bath. At its most intense I would say 8/10 but subsided gradually within 20-30 minutes. Again that 1 painkiller was enough to bring it down to absolutely tolerable level for the rest of the day.Day 3,4,5Pretty much identical days. Breakfast at 6am and immediately followed by BM which on these days were the most painful during/after with 8/10 intensity gradually subsiding after a long bath soak and 1x Panadeine Forte. The intense pain was relatively short lived and within 1.5-2 hrs back down to 2/10 and remaining low for the rest of the day. So far these were the hardest days but aside of the BMs totally manageable, walking around, up and down stairs, light chores absolutely no issue.Day 6Much the same with BM after breakfast. This day the pain was reduced (5/10) and only took about 30 min to subside. I still took 1x Panadeine Forte.Day 7,8,9,10BM again after breakfast with pain about 4(3)/10. As this was quite tolerable I didn’t take any painkillers and just soaked in the hot bath tub. It worked quite well and within 45-60 min the pain subsided. Since Day 7 I have not had to take any strong painkillers. Although still taking the anti-inflammatory tablet once a day.So this is my progress to date and although not quite back to normal and the healing is still in initial stages (surgeon indicated 6-8 weeks) in terms of pain it has been absolutely manageable. Recovery is very different for everyone but if I have to give my 3 top tips..SURGEONIf you have the option of selecting your surgeon (understand this might not be possible everywhere) do choose a specialist Colorectal surgeon. They deal with the intricate anatomy of the anal canal on a daily basis and their incisions are likely to be more precise than a General surgeon. Yes, it is a minor surgery and not life threatening but as we all ‘have to go’ on a regular basis.. millimeters can make a difference to a quality of life.BMsI guess this has been mentioned here a lot and I definitely agree that quality (soft) as well as quantity (the number of times one goes) plays a huge part in the recovery. Constipation is the biggest setback but going too many times might also cause repeated pain episodes and strains on the wound preventing from healing. I take 1x sachet of Movicol and in the first couple of days ate only soups and soft foods (porridge, boiled veggies).ROUTINEThis has been quite hard for me as I don’t really enjoy doing/eating the same things but will admit it has paid off. In the first week, I diligently woke up, ate, took my medicine in the same time every day. I guess my body got into the routine which meant I also did my BMs every morning at the same time. I have always struggled with regularity (hence the hem issue) and this was first time in my life that I not only did my business daily but on the clock. Absolute godsend as it meant my wound had 24 hrs of uninterrupted healing and the BM pain was getting better each day.I hope that my story helps others to prepare for the op and hopefully ease some worries and anxiety of the recovery journey. I would be more than happy to give my two cents worth if there is any other information anyone needs. Wishing you all a great recovery."

I'll post my notes here and update in the comments.Hemorrhoidectomy Recovery NotesTwo grade 4 hemorrhoids, one grade 1-2 hemorrhoid plus external hemorrhoid removed.Presurgery: on doctor’s orders, I began Celebrex 5 days before surgery and Gabapentin 2 days before surgery and did two enemas the morning of surgery. Based on advice from various forums, I switched to a very soft diet (yogurts and blended soups) 4 days before surgery, doing clear liquids only the day before surgery and began taking stool softeners 5 days prior to surgery. Installed a bidet attachment to the toilet, so no more wiping.Day 1 (surgery at 11am, home by 3pm) - no pain, but awareness of swelling after urinating. Started using ice packs. Bone Broth and water only. Continued taking the Celebrex, Gabapentin and Colace. Have a prescription for Norco (hydrocodone/acetaminophen) but won’t take unless necessary. Surgeon injected local anaesthetic that should last 1-3 days.Day 2 - awareness creeping in. Started Sitz bath followed by ice pack regimen. Started back on high protein yogurt, cooked fruit, AllBran Buds and blended vegetable soups made with bone broth to keep protein intake up (protein is really important for cell repair and healing). Irritation started around midday. Trying lidocaine on gauze. Started taking one 220 mg naproxen sodium on an 8 hour schedule. Generally mild, but constant burning sensation all afternoon and evening, can be easily distracted by reading or watching tv. Did a 20 minute very slow walk (1.7 mph) on the treadmill in the evening.Day 3 - woke up completely pain and irritation free. A little bleeding. Perhaps a stitch came off and that was the burning yesterday? Same food plan as day 2. Shortly after breakfast, felt like a BM was possible so I got on the treadmill to walk until I was sure of the urge. 15 minutes later, went to the bathroom. Zero pain. Not much produced, but most of my presurgery BMs involved some degree of discomfort (because it aggravated the hemorrhoids) so this was a very nice change. Most wondrously, when patting dry there was nothing “there” any more. I forgot what normal felt like. Did several Sitz baths, but I have given up ice packs (no discernible swelling) and lidocaine (didn’t make a difference yesterday when the burning was present).Day 4 - woke up knowing a BM would happen but wanted to wait until the urge was, well, urgent. After breakfast and a cup of coffee, had my second BM. Still no pain, but I made sure to not strain at all. I just relaxed into it. More formed than yesterday and a tiny amount of blood. I’m going to introduce non-blended (but still soft) foods into the diet today. Basically soups and stews for the foreseeable future."

So i couple of weeks ago i finally decided to go ahead with electrotherapy treatment for my grade 2 haemorrhoids. I suffered for about 6 months with pain and bleeding when having a BM and had tried different treatments options recommended by my GP (banding, ointments, creams and diets) with no luck. I really didn't want to have surgery as I'm self employed and after reading forums knew that I would be off work quite sometime.Anyway, I read up online about electrotherapy which is where they use an electrical current to shrink the haemorrhoid and decided to give it a go before going down the route of having a hemorrhoidectomy (which was my last resort). So i was treated two weeks ago and the nurse who treated me used a small tube to open up my bottom and used an electrotherapy device which gave a small electrical current to both of my haemorrhoids (8-10 mins on each). i didn't feel pain, just a sligh bit of discomfort when they reposition the tube. The consultation, and treatment lasted about 45 mins. I was given no anaesthetic and after the treatment I carried on with my normal activities and went to work the next day. As a result of the treatment, my haemorrhoids have now completely shrunk and im no longer in pain. The nurse had said they'd shrunk during treatment and they keep on shrinking for up to week after treatment. I was told before the procedure that I may need more than one treatment as mine were quite large however, I can now go to the gym and work without any issues. I paid privately for this treatment as electrotherapy is not available on the NHS just yet. I'm so happy I didn't have surgery and gave this treatment a go."

I’ve been stalking this page like it was my bible. Thank you to everyone who has left comments and stories about their own experiences. It has truly made such a difference and thankfully has made me feel not so alone. Backstory: I’m 36 and decided to finally go through a hemorroidectomy. One of the many gifts from childbirth was obtaining these little devils. I had a couple, smaller, external ones from my first delivery but my second really did me in. After delivery I was in substantial pain, not from delivery but from my newly found presents. They were the only things I could feel through the epidural while giving birth.My surgeon recommended a hemorroidectomy with a colonoscopy. So I had to prep a few days beforehand. Arrived for surgery on 9/27. I woke up okay, with no pain. Went home - thought wow - I can tolerate this - not too bad. I didn’t realize at the time they had given me a very strong numbing agent that would here soon wear off...and it did - around 8pm that evening. Hell had started. It was awful, the most torturous pain imaginable. Thankfully, he had given me some pretty good pain relief ocycodone/acetaminophen 7.5 - 325 with the 5% lidocaine and Gabapentin. Unfortunately it didn’t help. It took the slightest edge off - the first night I couldn’t sit, stand or lay down. I dozed off a few times on the sitz bath with my pillow. I have been on colace and Benefiber. Didn’t use the bathroom for a few days which is common with colonoscopy but when I finally did go after taking a few doses of miralax, it was brutal. Little razor blades and shards of glass. I used the sitz bath to help go and I have been using it since. I was surprised by how small, soft my movements were with the pain experienced. I was pale, sweaty, and honestly pretty sure I almost passed out. I have been using perennial cold packs, rotating Motrin with the pain pills. Unfortunately the lidocaine has no effect on me - just burns but never numbs. This has been an experience and I’m sure this experience is not even close to being over but at least today - is the first day I feel on the road to recovery.Just a side note on why some experiences seemed to be so different. My surgeon explained that if you have internal hems they can do the procedure with very limited pain due to the nerves further up in the rectum whereby external hems are only removable through excruciating surgery. The pain is so severe due to the nerves at the bottom of the rectum. Thankfully, my surgeon was very honest in preparing me for the recovery and pain, I believe his words were..""excruciating pain”..""worse than childbirth”... “most painful surgery you can have..” - I really appreciate his honesty because it really allowed me to emotionally prepare. With his pushing I took a week off work with the understanding I may need two. I am definitely the person who will push themselves, so again I appreciate his prodding to take the time off.Any questions, please ask!"

Very positive experience!","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/8-days-post-op-very-positive-experience--714846","Hello all,<br>I am now 8 days post op and am doing fantastic. I'm starting to think maybe my surgeon was a magician because the worst my pain has gotten so far was maybe a 4 on a scale of 1 to 10. I actually stopped taking pain meds 3 days after surgery. <br>I'm seriously so surprised at how well things have been going and wanted to share my experience. Sorry that these are disorganized but here are some key points: <br> <br>I had 1 very large external excised and 2 large internals banded. I also had a fissure I'd been dealing with since July.Doctor's orders: start eating light 3 nights before surgery. You will probably not poop for a few days after the operation, so the food you eat a few days prior will be what your body will be passing afterwards. (I just starting having chicken noodle soup for dinner)Did 2 enemas the morning of surgery. Barely anything came out the 2nd time around. Good sign!I was able to talk to my anesthesiologist before the surgery. I told him I get really nauseous when I'm put under and he took great care to make sure I was comfortable. He said he would use medications that don't heavily sedate the body so I'd recover faster and he wouldn't have to use ""intense"" medications to wake me back up. I woke up with 0 pain and 0 nausea!My doctor gave me some kind of numbing shot before I woke up that was supposed to last up to 72 hours to keep my pain levels down. It seemed to have work because I was literally in no pain for several days after surgery.She said she didn't understand why doctors use gauze or any material that patients have to poop out later after surgery. She used a dissolving gel pack in my butt so I wouldn't have to worry about trying to poop it out it later. Maybe ask your doctor if they can avoid using gauze?My first BM was 2 days post op. It was soft and painless! Definitely eat light meals in the days prior to your operation and start your stool softeners ASAP!Doctor said NO to Metamucil or any fiber supplements. She prescribed me Colace and Miralax to stay regular, and said to take Milk of Magnesia if I went 3 days without pooping.Don't strain when you have a BM. Your stools should literally just fall out of you as you relax and sit there. (I have a squatty potty but found leaning forward and to one side felt better)She was very adamant on avoiding constipation at all costs:DIARRHEA > CONSTIPATION! While diarrhea is obviously not a good thing, she said it's a LOT easier to recover from diarrhea after a hemorrhoidectomy.Diarrhea = drink more water, ease off on the laxatives. At least you're not getting backed up.Constipation = the longer you go without pooping, the harder the stools will get, the more you're going to get backed up, the more you're going to have to struggle to poop out later. You can also get impacted, which is definitely not something you want to deal with after you've had the surgery.The worst day so far was actually day 6. Even though my stools had been pretty soft, for some reason my anus felt extremely dry this day and it was unpleasant to have a BM. Pain only went up to a 4 though. Definitely tolerable. Less painful than pooping with a fissure.Sitz baths help! A nurse said to me ""the hotter the better"". Obviously don't burn yourself, but get it as hot as you can tolerate.Fill a sock up with some rice. You can microwave it and hold it up to your butt for some relief. Heat = increased bloodflow to the area = helps with healing. But use an ice pack to help with inflammation. I often cycled between the two when I was dealing with a thrombosed hemorrhoid prior to surgery.Hot/cold bidets are awesome. I had my husband install one from Amazon the week before surgery. No wiping!<br>So far I'm extremely happy with the results and have no regrets so far. My doctor did an amazing job! My diet hasn't changed drastically but I have made sure to eat fruits everyday (Apples and plums specifically) and limiting red meat. I also now take Colace 3x a day (All 3 at once in the morning) and Miralax around noon. I try to drink an extra glass of water here and there but honestly haven't been that extreme with upping my water intake. <br><br>I hope my story will help put some troubled minds at ease. I was honestly terrified of getting the surgery and preparing for the worst because of the many horror stories I had read. I do think my doctor was very skilled and took extra precautions to keep me out of trouble. I have my follow-up appointment with her in a few weeks and will post again with the ""final"" results."

"Piles","Update 10 months post hemorrhoidectomy","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/update-10-months-post-hemorrhoidectomy-713493","Hi, all. Its been a while since Ive updated my post surgery status so I thought Id take the time to do that today. So I had my full hemorrhoidectomy (3 externals removed, 2 internals left) on November 8th last year, so I am now 10 months post op. Ive gotten on here many times during my recovery to reach out for support during the hard days, and also to answer questions that others had. To say the least, this forum has been a Godsend to me. I have had a very tough time during these 10 months and sometimes felt I would never get better. I felt like giving up many times, as my recovery seemed to be never ending, or I would finally start to see the light at the end of the tunnel, only to have another setback. To further complicate matters, I found out in July of this year, just 8 months after my hemorrhoid surgery (which I was still not fully recovered from) that I needed not 1 but TWO more surgeries!! I was devastated, but also in so much pain, that I was willing to let the docs do whatever they had to do to end my suffering. Long story short, on July 25th, I endured both surgeries on the same day, back to back! The first was a cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal--it was severely diseased & caused me months & months of the worst abdominal pain imaginable. I could not eat, was vomiting daily, my digestive system was on a rampage, & I began having daily diarrhea that was pure green bile. The diarrhea re-inflammed my internal hemmi's and I was in constant pain. Then my gynocologist informed me I needed a total hysterectomy due to fibroid tumors, severe menstrations monthly, & a prolapsed uterus. I was scared & devastated, as you can imagine.) So I gave the go ahead, and had the surgeries. Tomorrow will be 7 weeks post op from those. The recovery was rough, having had 2 surgeries in one day, but I am now finally starting to feel like a human again. Both of the surgeons who operated on me in July have now released me, & I am for the first time in 10 months (since the hemorroidectomy) about 90% recovered & nearly pain-free. My gyno told me that the reason its taken so long for my hemorrhoid surgery to heal was because the uterus tumors were so heavy and there was so many, that they caused my uterus to drop into my vagina. That constant pressure was not only the reason for my vaginal pain & pressure, but also was responsible for putting constant pressure in my rectum, which kept the internal hemmi's from staying inside & healing properly. I had never heard of this happening to anyone until it happened to me, but it explained so much. Now that I no longer have a diseased gallbladder, or fibroid filled dropped uterus putting pressure on on my rectum, my internal hemmi's have almost completely healed. The only time I am even aware that they are still there is if I have a long bout of diarrhea, which will cause them to poke out and swell & make sitting very painful. I had this happen after a weeklong dose of antibiotics for an infection & the diarrhea lasted the entire week. As soon as the meds were out of my system, the diarrhea went away, & the internal hemmi's shrunk back inside & I no longer felt them. So if anyone out there is still 8 or more months post hemorrhoidectomy and still suffering from flare ups, or pain, and if you are female, talk to your gynocologist to see if the problem could be from pressure in your rectum from uterine fibroid tumors or a prolapsed uterus. I say this because it happened to me, & it might just be happening to one of you. If that is your problem...have the hysterectomy. You wont regret it. It has almost completely allowed my bottom to heal. As long as I have these 2 internal hemmi's, I know I will have to be vigilant in the care of my bottom. I will always have to do all I can to avoid constipation and/or diarrhea, drink plenty of fluids, get enough fiber, eat healthy, be careful not to lift anything too heavy, & treat any flare up as soon as it happens (I still use recticare OTC lidocaine ointment for any short term pain that may arise, & I still take a daily stool softener & 1 capful daily of mirilax, unless my bowels are loose, & then I back off of them until my bm's are back to normal. My only fear now is a stomach virus or bout of food poisoning or another weeklong dose of antibiotics, as all of these will cause severe diarrhea for me, & definately cause a hemorroid flare up.) So there it is. I have had 3 major surgeries since November and I am still here. I can finally report that I am better than I have been in what feels like forever. So for all of you out there still suffering & thinking it will never end, dont lose hope. It may take months & months, you may even need another procedure to fix another problem, but trust me...you WILL get better & come out of all of this stronger for having endured it. I promise!! Sorry this is so long but mine is not an overnight success story for sure. But I do consider it a success story, nonetheless. I hope my story will help someone out there thinking it will never end. It will. Sometimes it just takes alot longer than our surgeons tell us, & everyone heals at different paces. Dont compare your recovery time to anyone elses...we all heal at our own pace. So everyone please take good care of yourselves and never lose the faith. This is a very difficult thing to endure, but with God's help (and a little help from our forum friends) we will all be okay. It may just take some time. Love to you all, JANET"

"Piles","Advice on my struggles with internal hemorrhoids","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/advice-on-my-struggles-with-internal-hemorrhoids-711291","Hi all. I am 32, male, in US, chronic liver disease patientI have episodes of hemorrhoids as young as I can remember. When I was less than age 5, my grandparents let me drink coffee. It was a nightmare and I had hemorrhoids since then. I think they were internal as my mom said she had to push them in to clean me after bowel movements.Fast forward to college years aged 18-22, I had a few major episodes of hemorrhoids. My diet was junk foods, college fast foods and school cafe foods, sweetened drinks like soda and sweet green teas. I recalled self treating with Prep H and wetting toilet papers, then sought medical help from university health center where they gave me kit to examine my stools due to blood. Nothing serious occurred but it was painful sitting in class and being outside with friends. I slept or stayed indoors for a long time.Last year I had a few episodes of bleeding hemorrhoids. I am very squeamish and has decided not to look at bloody stools while going and due increased fiber and fluids I survived after an acute episode (5-10 days) of bleeding hemorrhoids. I also did not eat the right diet as well as stressed from being at home with guests living with us during summer months. I was working a new job as a bank teller so I was pretty occupied with that and taking my parents to doctors and other offices. My bleeding hemorrhoids were accompanied with abdominal pain so it took a good 10 months later till they gave me an ab/pelvic CT scan and flex sigmoidoscopy (June 21st this year) without bowel prep then one colonoscopy (August 15th last week) with full bowel prep and anathesia. Both times the flex and full scopes the doctors diagnosed me with internal hemorrhoids.Sorry for making this long, but last week (Monday August 10) I had a one-time episode of bleeding but it was minor drip/streak onto the last stool during bowel movement and on toilet wipes. I immediately worry as I was on a low residue or low fiber diet prior to prep and colonoscopy procedure. I used diaper rash cream and baby wipes 99% water, and even though I went 10 times the night before, there was no blood. After my procedure my bum was very sore. When I had the flex scope in June I made sure to use Miralax 3x dose per day for first 3-4 days. Now I forgot to do it and the first 2 days after my colonoscopy there was no blood; however I was straining and couldn't pass enough stools or had very low stool volume days 4 and 5.Today I had a lot of stools from 48 hours of constipation even though I had small urges and bloating. I worry if I made my ""small internal hemorrhoids"" worse by straining. There was a lot of blood with stools as I couldn't look directly. I took pictures to see it later when I leave the toilet so I would keep going and passing till I feel empty; I did this because I am afraid of fecal impaction as well as I used to poop about 1-2 times per day with high fiber and on vegan diet.I am seeking advices.I have several questions.1.) Should I go on a liquid or soft food diet till my hemorrhoids heal?Eating makes me go a lot, I started my vegan diet again starting June 2019 (I was vegetarian and vegan off and on for the last 4 years), and when I started on high fiber again I used to go after each meal 2-3 times a day. Now it's at least once a day and occasional twice a day. My fluid intake is close to 8 cups or more per day with countless trips to urinate.2.) What are your suggestions to increase iron intake due to massive bleeding.I would say my bowel movement I lost up to 4 tablespoons of blood.3.) Should I seek medical help?I felt dizzy and felt heated, thought I had a fever. The thermo said otherwise. I also suffer from health anxiety right now but taking Lexapro.4.) How can I alleviate my hemorrhoids with sitz bath? Do you have a suggestion to put in sitz bath besides Epson Salt.I am reluctant to try non-cream or oitment. I am taking Miralax 1-2 times or doses (17g x2 ) per day5.) What are your suggestions for OTC creams or ointments and suppositories? Please no mineral oils, vaseline, jelly petroleum or petrolum, or other toxic compounds like parabens. (Prep H)The WHO classified mineral oils in Prep H as carcinogen and other toxic compounds.6.) Do you have other suggestions?, like other laxatives, or lubricant oils (castor oil) and NOT mineral oil..7.) If you have any other advice please let me know.Thanks,-Kev"

Help!","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/bleeding-accompanied-with-a-high-dose-of-anxiety-help--711147","Hello fellow Hemorrhoid sufferers. I have 4 children and with my last pregnancy I noticed a small lump while I was washing (4.5 years ago). After doing a bit of research I concluded that it was a Hemorrhoid. After having it for quite awhile it became thrombosed(very painful) and eventually disappeared. All was fine until about 6 months ago when I noticed blood streaked on my stool. It's continued ever since. I do believe it's bright red and it's not very much. I believe I still have Hemorrhoids although the doctor said she didn't see any. I don't have any external hemorrhoids that you can see unless I bear down, then my anus is surrounded by large purple bumps/veins that bulge (not even sure if they would be considered internal or external). Is streaked blood on the stool almost daily normal for Hemorrhoids? It seems that most people on this forum that experience blood have pools of it in the toilet. Also, are they internal or external hemorrhoids if you only see them when pushing? I do have a colonoscopy scheduled in 2 weeks."

I'm 36yrs old and just had a hemorrhoidectomy last monday and I'm still in terrible pain! For a month before surgery my hemorrhoids were flared up and causing alot of pain and bleeding so the Dr said surgery was my best option for relief. So far it's been miserable and almost unbearable. I've had 5 children and would have much rather been giving birth than going through this process. In order to have a bowel movement since surgery I had to take laxatives, drink prune juice & milk of magnesia. Finally passed some stool on day 7. The pressure is constant, the pain is ridiculous.

After the birth of my second child things really got bad. The hemorrhoids have really destroyed my quality of life over the past two years and after two bandings I have a hemorrhoidectomy scheduled in about 13 days. I have literally tried every over-the-counter, prescription and folklore remedy for hemorrhoids, squatting, ice, epsom salt baths, icing, garlic and nothing has worked. Yes, some things have temporarilyrelieved some symptoms but nothing has been curative. The bandings took care of a couple of internal hemorrhoids, but I am now left with one hemorrhoid that is a combination mixed internal / external. The internal part of this hemorrhoid prolapses with any sort of activity. Even just standing at the sink doing dishes for several minutes will cause it to protrude.I've been reading many of the posts on this site over the past few weeks. I have taken a lot of the tips to heart and have stocked up on needed supplies. I'm just wondering if someone can speak to the level of pain I could possibly experience?My first labor was 2 days long and not medicated. The pain I experienced with that was on an animal/ primal level. I say this as I was completely disconnected from reality the pain was so intense and the sounds that came out of me where animal-like in nature. The pain was so intense that for two days I could barely converse, didn't eat, had only a few sips of water given to me by the nurse. My entire focus was inward and just trying to make it through the intensity of the pain. I've never in my life experienced this level of pain I would put it in an otherworldly category. When I imagine the worst pain, excruciating pain, that is my reference point. Is this what I should be expecting post hemorrhoidectomy? Many posters have indicated that the pain was as bad/worse than childbirth. Is this the type of pain people are referring to?Any positive stories would also be much appreciated especially from anyone with removal of a single mixed hemorrhoid.thanks!!"

I want to contribute, writing my own recovery story, and I hope it would be a good help to someone. And I apologize for my English ))Warning. I followed my surgeon recommendations and I described them in details here, but it doesn't mean they would be suitable for you! Always listen to your doctor!Initial problem:""Happy shopping"" before surgery (recommended by my surgeon when we finally scheduled the day of my surgery). I bought:How to use: Make a dark brown tea. Cool it down. Put the hospital bed pad on the bed. Lie down on your back. Spread your legs apart. Soak the cotton pad in that ""tea"" and apply to the anus for 5 mins. Then take another pad and repeat the procedure. I used 10-15 soaked pads twice per day. It keeps wounds clean, decrease the swelling and increase the regeneration speed. Highly recommend.How to use: Apply the Sea-Buckthorn Seed Oil to the anus, then insert the suppository into the rectum twice per day (morning and late evening) after defecation for 2 weeks (do it very very slowly and carefully). After 2 weeks post-op, use 1 suppository only once per day (late evening). Suppository helps with regeneration and it converts into the liquid oil inside of the rectum and helps with a stool passage (less painful).Preparation for surgery:Surgery:It was conducted on the gynecological examination table. They injected something IV and I slept peacefully for 1.5 hours (surgery duration).What they did to me (surgery):""Wake up, everything is done"":When I woke up, nothing bothered me aside of dizziness. No pain. Nothing. My surgeon gave me common recommendations (part of them are listed above) and meds (non-opioid painkillers [NSAID's] and stomach protectors. He told me to use them for 6 days only.Other ""lifestyle"" recommendations:Diet recommendations (to follow them during 1.5-2.0 months post-op):Warning. I've never had any constipations, my stool always was regular and normal, so beware, it might be not suitable to you!That's all...The surgeon didn't prescribe me any stool softeners and laxatives. Also, he didn't prescribe me any antibiotics.Okaaayyy...""Happy"" first week:The pain was severe, but more or less manageable with painkillers.I was in the bed almost 24/7.I had zero appetite and ate only clear soups and drunk a lot of herbal tea and water.Also, I used suppositories (twice per day) and did a lot of herbal baths using cotton pads (as I explained it earlier).""Ecstatic"" second week:I started to eat at the end of the first week and my first stool happened on the 7th day post-op. It was...well...interesting. Lol. I was off of painkillers already and I really thought I would die. The stool was soft and formed, but it felt like I was giving birth to a very very big hedgehog.The pain after stool lasted for 5-6 hours and I used 1 pill of painkiller, because that pain was hardly manageable. Other stools were the same and I used painkillers after them for the whole week.I didn't have any bleedings, any unusual discharges and smells, just severe pain during defecation and more or less manageable pain after that.I had stools 1 time per day only (morning; my normal pre-op regime) and I was in the bed almost 24/7.Also, I continued to use suppositories (twice per day) and did a lot of herbal baths using cotton pads.""Glimpses of hope"" third week:The pain during defecation and after that started subside gradually. I didn't use any painkillers, everything was manageable.I started to take hot baths and it was really heaven on the earth.I continued to keep my diet and continued to use suppositories (once per day, late evening) and did a lot of herbal baths using cotton pads.Also, I started to walk more and help my husband to do chores (no hard work and not for too long).Everyday I felt better and better.""The light at the end of the tunnel"" forth week:The pain during defecation and after that was almost insignificant. I would say it was more a discomfort feeling, than an actual pain.I had a stool once per day (morning) as usual and it was soft and formed. The diameter of feces was almost the same as I had pre-op.I started to seat for 5-15-30 minutes. It wasn't painful, but uncomfortable.I continued to keep my diet and continued to use suppositories (once per day, late evening) and did a lot of herbal baths using cotton pads.I started to go out often and walk a lot (shopping or just simple walk without any goal).Now, it is 5th post-op week and I'm doing well. I continue to keep my diet, do herbal baths and don't use suppositories anymore. I clean myself with water and baby soap after every defecation and don't wear underwear at home.I continue to visit my surgeon every week to control the process of healing and every time he tels me ""good girl"". Lol.I have two jobs and I want to give really big hug to my surgeon, because he warned me, that the recovery process would take 4-6 weeks, so I signed myself off of work for 6 weeks.As you can see, my recovery period was normal and without complications, but it didn't last for 2-3 days as many advertisements say. Don't believe them. The full recovery takes a month! Don't think it is a minor surgery. It is not!I want to say to you, guys, prepare yourselves for surgery thoroughly. Ask (hire) someone to take care about you and your kids for first 2 weeks at least. Take a break from work for 3-4 weeks at least. Be, literally, bed ridden for first 2 weeks. Use painkillers (they reduce pain and reduce spasm of the internal sphincter). Don't tolerate the pain. Keep the strict diet and really, really drink 2.5-3.0L of liquids. Keep your wounds clean and dry. Don't think about your anus 24/7, distract yourselves with books, tablets, phones, TV, etc. Stay positive.All of that feels like a walking on a thin rope, but if you are very slow and careful, everything will be alright. Don't play a hero, let yourselves to be vulnerable.My surgeon said to me: ""Don't be afraid of pain. It is a good pain. It reminds you that you don't have hemorrhoids anymore..."". Wise words.I wish you, guys, to be healthy and happy!"

I also started working full time for about two weeks, and I was doing retail so I was on my feet all day. After about an hour or two of being on my feet at work, my hemorrhoids would start to swell and like out and it was very painful. I tried to ignore the pain and keep working, but soon after that is when they began to bleed profusely. So much that I feel it on my shorts while I was working so I had to run to the bathroom and saw the blood, explained the situation to my manager and he completely understood. He let me go on medical leave until I get it figured out, which is when I went to my Dr. and scheduled the bandings. Fast forward to now, I have my third and final banding two weeks from today.

Daily activites didnt affect it very much unless i lifted heavy items numerous times in the day or constantly standing for long periods of time cause it would sometimes cause them to slide out and then bleed, woudlnt know it was bleeding til i felt somethign wet dribbling down my leg or someone says hey you have a red spot on the rear of your shorts (mainly khakis, very embarrassing)Furthermore, about a month ago i guess from today 7/20, i had a colonoscopy done to make sure there wasnt anything cancerous in my rectum prior to surgery. Leading up to the colonoscopy wasnt the greatest since i had to drink this yucky liquid stuff to cleanse my rectum. let me tell you THAT STUFF WORKS LOL. Results from that were good nothing cancerous. Ill go striaght to post surgery, prior to being discharged the nurse said i had some packing inside my rectum that will becoming out eventually and having some blood will be normal. the packitn finally came out after 3 days plus a little bit of soft stools, i was so exited i told my parents ""i crapped i crapped!"" lol i was so thrilled to pass it cause i was worried about how long to wait for it. surgery happened on a monday and that first week was very tough, could barely move around without having pain but glad i had hydrocodone. i soaked in warm water in the tub with bath salts (forgot the actual name for it) to make it easier for the stools the pass through, it worked but was hesitant on going fearing it would be painful but to my surprise it wasnt very painful. i cleaned myself up and just relaxed, during each day after surgery i used metamucil powder and stool softners to aid in bowel movements. After about a week after surgery Each day was a positive step to healing BUT i was still in some sort of discomfort cause of the two stitches down there and the growing hairs that was shaved for surgery, i think that was more painful at times believe it or not lolfood wise about a week after surgery i was slowly creeping back into my normal diet but being careful in what i eat. Oatmeal and apple sauce are great to eat cause of it being soft.about 2 weeks after surgery i was doing well, crapping good in the toilet with very minimal blood dripping. its quite satisfying to make bowel movements veryy easily now compared to years ago when it would be very arduous to do so. i spent about 2.5 weeks out of work and was able to return to work under light duty and gradually do more stuff. its extremely important NOT TO RUSH BACK INTO STUFF. you must take it easy to avoid unnecessary bleeding , so far its been a great recovery and ive been at work for a week and a half now i thinkthanks to my parents for lettign me crash at their place for my recovery it all went well. hope this helps and ill try to add more stuff if i happen to think of it"

"Piles","My Experience: Rubber Band Ligation plus Thrombosed External Hemorrhoids","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-experience-rubber-band-ligation-plus-thrombosed-external-hemorrhoids-690007","I'm in the middle of a very long recovery and figured I'd take the time to lay out my experience in the hopes that a) it helps others and b) provides a jumping off point for people to share their own experiences. In short, I've had 3 rubber band ligations for internal hemorrhoids (2 bands each time) and have subsequently been dealing with 3 thrombosed external hemorrhoids after the fact. The relationship between those two things is a matter of some debate, but regardless, I had the banding treatments and have since been dealing with the VERY long process of waiting out several painful blood clots on the outside of my anus. It's been a hoot.I'll start at the beginning.In April of last year, after a particularly nasty bout of constipation that I should have treated with fiber and water but was too stupid to do so, I ended up with what felt like a prolapsed hemorrhoid (or hemorrhoids). Having had something like this when I was younger that resolved itself, I attempted to treat with Preparation H and--shudder--reinsertion in the hopes that it would eventually go away. After 3 months of this, I decided it was time to see a colorectal surgeon. Upon examination, he told me that he could do the rubber band ligation procedure and that this was relatively safe, with mild pain, but good results. I took a week to think about it then returned and said go for it.In retrospect, the recovery from that banding and subsequent bandings wasn't all that bad. I had a sense of ""fullness"", some bleeding and pain for a few days, but with Metamucil and water, I was able to tolerate it fairly well. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't recommend doing it as a weekend activity with your pals, but I survived.3 weeks after the first treatment, I still had a sensation of prolapsing or general swelling and, since it went okay the first time, I figured it was safe to keep going. So we banded again. Arguably this treatment was more painful, plus there was a terrific moment when my doctor wasn't getting enough suction on the machine and had to solve that problem mid-procedure. Turns out he needed a new hose and chastised the nurse for not checking the suction before we started. ""Take your time,"" I said, my butt in the air, trying not to eat the cushion my face was pressed into. As new bands got slapped onto a very sensitive part of my anatomy, I recall thinking ""this is the last time."" But honestly, I was willing to do this until I was fully healed.Same 3 week period of recovery. As before, I spent the weekend relaxing. Took Advil. Slept in another room away from my girlfriend so I could toss and turn. On the back end (relax) of that experience, and approaching week 3 (again), I felt what seemed like another prolapse toward the back, or upper, part of my anus. I wonder in retrospect if this swelling was actually coming from the rim (an external) but regardless, safe procedure right? Let's do it one more time. So I did. Last time, no hose malfunctions, and that seemed to deal with these sensations of prolapse.Then the fun really began.We started in July, and now we're in late September and I start to feel bad sensations back there that I had never felt before: burning primarily. Scary, since I had never even had pain before. Was this rectal fluid? Was I leaking all the time? Did I make a terrible mistake? Was I broken? I visited my doctor again (he was getting to know me pretty well at this point) and he diagnosed ""pruritus ani"" (irritated bunghole to the layperson) and gave me Calmoseptine cream: a combination of zinc oxide as a skin protectant and menthol for its cooling effects. In my case, it might as well of been f---king napalm. Despite being concerned that I needed a ""skin protectant"" from ""moisture"" and why the hell THAT was the case, I went home and applied the cream, the thinking being that my skin just needed time to heal to achieve a state of normalcy.This stuff burned like all hell. I wiped it off. Then I resolved to try again, since my treatment was all I was thinking about at this point. God it hurt. It was like I traded my old problems for new, worse ones. Burning, sticky ones. Well, after two days of trying this cream, I finally got a new result: I developed my first ever thrombosed external hemorrhoid. (That's a big painful purple blood clot on the rim of your ***.)Now, I have to stop here and ask you are those two things related? The burning cream and the blood clot? My doctor said no. But menthol stimulates blood flow so it's not exactly a crazy theory. Or maybe having it on my skin made me clench my cheeks for two days straight and THAT caused it. Read on and decide for yourself. I know one thing: I'll never put that stuff on my butt ever again. Ever.So at this point I'm dealing with a thrombosed external hemorrhoid (or TEH if you're busy). This is supposedly a rare condition that is arguably worse than the original prolapsing because at least that didn't hurt (even if having your insides or your outside wins the battle of which is worse psychologically). I'd say it was the size of a black bean (for some reason, we always compare this stuff to food) and it was quite clearly on the outside of my anus--one reason I'm inclined to believe in the accuracy of my original diagnose of internals. This one felt different. The doctor, as most do, advocated ""conservative"" treatment (i.e. wait it out).The Internet will tell you these things take 2-3 weeks to resolve. This has NOT been my experience. I'd budget 2 months of your life at least for letting these little b******s subside. Possibly more.Anyway, I wait and burn, and just feel like hot garbage. The acute pain is gone in about 2 weeks, but that raw sensation, and the feeling of ""something"" being there remains. It gets physically bigger. Then smaller. Then bigger again. But over time appears to be very slowly shrinking. Or rather, after 4 weeks or so, it appears to be shrinking. I iced it plenty. I binge watched TV and generally felt worthless. I'm not normally a depressed person, but it was an emotion I have since gotten pretty acquainted with. Good moments were few and far between and I held them tight whenever possible. I went for walks. I lived my life whenever I absolutely had to. If I'd sweat back there, the combination of moisture and rawness felt like I was pouring diarrhea out my *** and would never be right again. I worried that I stank. (I didn't.) I imagined that I'd have to go live in a cave wearing adult diapers. Fortunately, I've never been able to substantiate this ""leakage"" fear (very clean undies and such) so I think it's probably just a misreading of a foreign, icky sensation. Thank. God. Not a great position to be in, but given the choice, I'll keep my continence if you don't mind.This takes us just past Thanksgiving. The external seems to be gone at this point. It's here that I'd like to say that even when you think these things are ""gone"" be ready to still feel them for quite some time. I return to my doctor and ask what gives. He goes back to this ""pruritus ani"" diagnosis and advocates really committing to the hydrochloric acid, I mean Calmoseptine. Not being entirely sure it was the source of my TEH (since no one else seemed to think so) I said sure and committed to a week of using it.I got maybe 3 or 4 days into it before I had to stop. Then waited a bit and tried again. And then stopped. A few days later, the world fell out from under me: TWO more thrombosed external hemorrhoids. This time in a different spot.I can't tell you how devastating that felt. It was like in prison movies when a guy gets thrown in ""the hole"" and just when he thinks he's coming out, they tack on another month. I had just clawed and scraped my way through the last two months, thinking that once this thrombosis was resolved, I'd be free. And just as I began to accept that maybe that might happen, I got sentenced to a new double helping of the same damn thing. Only worse because I had to wonder if more were on the way. What was I doing wrong? Why was this happening to me? Why the hell did I order MORE Calmoseptine online? I guess I'll just keep that tube in case I ever hate anyone enough to recommend it to them.So now I've got perhaps a 75% healed TEH on one side and two brand new ones on the other side. I'm afraid to move. I'm afraid to NOT move. It's November 25th and I figure maybe I'll feel better by Christmas.And now present day. We are almost to New Years and how am I doing?It's hard. Sitting for long stretches sucks so it's difficult to focus on work. I'm less social. I used to sit for very long stretches in front of my computer (hey, you think these things are related??) and now I'm scared to. Plus it just feels plain wrong all the time. Painful after a while. I feel like everything I do could touch off another TEH. If that happened, I honestly don't know what I'd do. I can still feel the new ones, or at least one of them. The original one I feel occasionally, but less so. I want to believe I'm getting better but it's hard to tell. I've taken about a hundred pictures of my butt (available on request, just kidding) and find myself struggling with the ongoing mental battle. I just want to be right again. In my darkest moments, I worry that I made a terrible mistake in getting the RBL in the first place, though I'm not sure what else I could have done. In my best moments, I think this is just part of a very long recovery process and these things take an ungodly amount of time to go away. I don't know. It's very hard to see the light, but I try to remain hopeful. Maybe in a month or two this will all be a memory. Maybe.At this point, I'd like to say that I found a great thread on Healthboards which seems to have numerous parallels with my own story. I read it like some people read The Bible and it's given me more hope than anything else I've read online: https://www.healthboards.com/boards/bowel-disorders/1040189-external-hemmie.htmlI HAVE to believe this will subside. But it's difficult. And it's very unlike me not to be proactive and try to ""fix"" a problem. It's just that anything I could do right now risks making things worse and so I just have to drink water, eat fiber, walk everyday, and rely on my angel of a girlfriend to help me get through. I miss being able to just sit like a normal person, but with any luck, that day will come.Wish all of you a healthy and happy New Year. If I feel significantly better, I'll come back and post again."

Need help ","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hemorrhoids-constipation-problems-need-help-705111","ok so as you can read my title i have had constipation problems for a few days and now i think i have developed hemorrhoids. Let me start of by explaining everything and hopefully someone can help me ASAP. Now keep in mind im 19 years old, average weight, dont really work out, and smoke weed.so my constipation problem started around last Sunday so 6/9/19 to be exact & Today is 6/19/19. On saturday afternoon i took a nap, after awakening i went to eat a sandwich my mother had ordered. After eating that sandwich i stayed up playing video games and went to sleep around 5AM. Now i usually use the bathroom about 4-5 hrs after eating this sandwich because it usually makes me want to ""Go"" but i didnt this time and i found it weird but didnt think about it too much. The next day i still felt like i didnt have to go and i decided to just wait until i did feel like i had to go but that moment never came so i just decided to eat. After a few hours still i didnt feel the urge to go so i decided to just go sit on the toilet and see if eventually i wanted to go. Keep in mind though that i did this because i started to feel constipated and bloated. After trying hard to push ""stool type 1"" on google came out. It was hard to push, came in small pebble like shaped pieces, and it was a small amount of it. I started eating better foods and drinking lots of water. It kept going on like that until Thursday, when i asked my teacher for any suggestions, he told me try a ""smooth move tea"" which is laxative tea and another friend told me about prune juice. That night i took the tea (only once did i use it) and went to sleep, when i woke up i took a 8oz cup of prune juice and starting to go much easier but it was coming out liquidish now (im guessing because of the laxative and prune). Throughout the day it was like that and i didnt feel bloated or constipated anymore so that problem was out the way. The next day was saturday and i only took another 6oz of prune juice that morning because i still felt like it was hard to push out the stool , no more laxative though, and was going throughout the day liquidish again. Sunday came and i decided to not drink anymore prune juice to see if my stomach could go alone without the juice, and it was hard bust still managed to poop without it (i could only poop squatting over the toilet it began to be hard to push while sitting regularly) it was ""stool type 6"" now , mushy but it was like a snake stool but still in short pieces. I thought hopefully the stool was going to become more slid throught the next day so i left it at that. Forgot to mention but since i was worried the whole week i was basically sitting on the toilet for a lengthy amount of time. Monday came 6/17/19 and i woke up , i didnt feel like i had to go poop but i decided to just sit on the toilet to make sure . After pushing and squatting stool type 6 came out again but after pushing more liquidish came out too so thay freaked me out a little. i decided to go to school that day and was home by 10AM because i leave early. after getting home i pooped a little bit again sometime between 10AM-12PM. that was the last time i pooped. After that around 5PM i felt like i had stool ready to poop so i went to the bathroom and i pushed , now nothing came out but it sure felt like there was poop trying to come out so ipushed a littlemore and eventually gave up, i grabbed a wipey for sensitive skin and wiped myself. When i did i felt a bump on my anus and was freaked out. It didnt hurt but it felt like a filled up water balloon, it was like squishy and i was scared. the next day (Tuesday) i went to the doctors but they said that it probably went down (the inflammation) and just gave me a natural fiber therapy mix for my stomach. KEEP IN MIND I STILL HAVENT POOPED SINCE MONDAY (DONT KNOW IF THATS BAD OR NOT). i went home had a mix of the mix and thought i had to go so i sat on the toilet and felt like i couldnt let go still like it wont allow me to push out so i took a video and saw everytime i did try to push out the anus would swole up and not open so im scared that i might not be able to poop and that could possibly become worse. im sorry for including pictures but im just really scared and dont know what to do! SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ! the picture was the first time i felt it and the video is after i got home from the doctors image"

I had my external hemorrhoidectomy almost 8 months ago & I still have good days & bad. Alot of that seems to relate to my bowel movements, as with us all who are post surgery. I am still on 1-2 stool softeners a day to avoid constipation, but I still have it every once in a while. I drink as much water as I can choke down daily, but prolly don't get quite enough every day. Most of my bm's are pretty easy, but even those leave me feeling sore for anywhere from an hour to a full day. I don't understand! I thought this surgery was supposed to fix this. I do have 2 internal hemmi's the surgeon left alone because he said he couldn't remove those PLUS the 3 external's that he did remove. I think those 2 internals are the cause of most of my problems but dont know what to do. My hubby wants me to see a different doctor, maybe a specialist, to see what can be done, if anything. I still have some external swelling (looks kinda bumpy) and I took a picture about a month ago and another today to compare and contrast. Can anyone look at the 2 pics (remember they're about a month apart) and tell me what it looks like to you or if any of you looked or felt like this so far post surgery? Thanks for any responses!!"

"Piles","24 hours post op hemorrhoidectomy","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/24-hours-post-op-hemorrhoidectomy-704582","Hi,As the discussions on this board have helped me so much I wanted to share my experience so far with my hemorrhoidectomy.I am now just a little over 24 hours post-op hemorrhoidectomy. After having two bandings done (which significantly improved my situation) I decided to have the full hemorrhoidectomy operation as I still had one hemorrhoid that after two years of trying everything would simply not resolve. This hemorrhoid had completely destroyed my quality of life and I was no longer even able to take short walks without being in pain. It seemed like everything in my life revolved around this one hemorrhoid. Ultimately, I had one grade 3 internal/ external hemorrhoid removed. I had this procedure performed with a spinal anesthesia and the surgeon used the ligasure device.The surgery itself took approximately a half hour and then I was back in recovery. As I was numb from the waist down, I had 0/10 pain until the freezing wore off about seven to eight hours later. The nurse had also already loaded me up with 2 mg of exteded release hydromorph, a 1000 mg of acetaminophen, and 800 mg of ibuprofen earlier in the day. I was advised to stay on top of the medications as they indicated that the pain would be coming as soon as the anesthesia wore off and gave me another dose of 2mg of hydromorphone before I left the hospital. The only difficulty I had before being discharged was that it took me a couple of attempts before I was able to pee. I had very limited discomfort and was walking fairly steadily despite the anesthesia. I was able to sit comfortably for the 20 to 25 minute drive home. I was even able to sit with my children before bed.It wasn't until around 8 at night that the pain started to set in. The pain felt exactly as I expected it would. It felt like something had been cut and that there was now that stinging burning pain one gets with a cut as well as swelling. This pain was in no way agonizing and the medication was able to bring it down significantly. I set my alarm, as advised by other posters on this board, so that I could take pain medication throughout the night. I think that was key to keeping my pain at a reasonable level. I did; however, have a spike in pain in the middle of the night which surprised me as I had taken a dose of hydromorphone only two hours before. I was able to get that pain under control by taking a dose of ibuprofen 800mg and icing the area.I have been quite swollen today as to be expected, but overall I would say that the pain has been fairly manageable. In fact, I haven't taken any hydromorph since 4 in the morning and it is now 3pm. I've been managing by alternating acetaminophen and ibuprofen and icing frequently. As my surgeon advised against taking any baths for 48 hours, I have only hopped in the shower once to see if that provided a different type of relief which it did. I have been able to walk around my house and was even able to sit out on my deck for a few minutes of sunshine.I realize that as I have not yet had a bowel movement I am still in the hemorrhoidectomy honeymoon phase; however, thus far the pain has been very manageable. The pain has been similar to the times when I've had severe hemorrhoid flare-ups. The pain is familiar and I know how to manage it with ice, meds, etc. I had myself prepared for the absolute worst of rolling on the ground in sheer agony.My only concern is in addition to swelling where my hem was removed, I also have a lot of swelling at another external hemorrhoid that hasn't flared up in over 9 months..?I'm trying to drink as much water as possible and I'm eating only very soft foods such as fruit and vegetable juices, oatmeal and soups. I'm also taking a stool softener as well as Miralax. Hoping for the best when the bowel movement comes, but preparing for the worst.Posting this for anyone out there who has an upcoming hemorrhoidectomy or is considering having it done. I was petrified to have this surgery even though it was recommended to me 2 years ago and may have saved me two years of agony. I know I am only 24 hours post op and there are some tough days still to come, but today the surgery is done and I am okay. As my nurse put it yesterday, the pain that you experience post-op is healing pain not the chronic pain of the hemorrhoids that aren't healing and are destroying your quality of life."

However from the 2nd week, my anus got swollen multiple times when I did bowel movement. I felt it was not OK from there. After 3 weeks, I had the prolapse again for everytime I do bowel movement. It took around 10 minutes to go back inside. I visited my surgeon to check but she told me it's just the skin from canal not hemorrhoids. I took some photos for her to check but she still confirmed the same. After 1 month, 2 months and now 3 months, the prolapse is still there everytime I do bowel movement. I'm kind of disappointed and upset with the surgery. I've been told that the hemorrhoids were gone after 1 month and no prolapse.I decided to visit another proctologist and she told me it's still the hemorrhoids. She explained to me that the first surgeon didn't do it good enough (less stictches) so it's not effective. There are 2 options for me HAL RAR or M-M.I know that M-M is more efficient but it comes with a lot of pain and takes longer time for recovery. Tbh, I don't want to deal with hemorrhoids anymore. It's such a nightmare.Does anyone here had HAL rar for external hemorrhoids and are good after the operation?I also need experience from those who had M-M too.I appreciate any help or advice.Thank you."

I'm glad I hadn't as there are lots of horror stories out there that are super worrying to read.I had the surgery through the NHS but in a private hospital. I was booked in for morning surgery and was told I would be home the same day. The care at the hospital was excellent. I had a male nurse care for me who was very understanding of how embarrassing and personal these things are. I also met the surgeon (a wonderful lady) and the anaesthetist beforehand.Surgery was EUA (examination under anaesthetic), Halo or THD and mucopexy. I do have a skin tag but the surgeon said she doesn't remove them as the risk of infection is high and they can cause even more pain.The surgeon made it quite clear that I would be in quite a bit of pain for the first ten days but the results would be worth it. As soon as I had this conversation the nerves kicked in but no going back!I had to have an enema but the male nurse gave me the option to do it myself and as I was in my own room that was helpful and put me at ease.The anaesthetist had issues getting the needle in my hand so had to do in the other hand but it wasn't a problem. I woke up in recovery feeling very sore and was given lots of Painkillers before being taken back up to my room. Husband picked me up later that day and took me home with Movicol, Paracetamol, Ibuprofen and Codeine.The night of the surgery wasn't too bad, just a feeling of being kicked up the backside. Didn't have the best sleep but took my Painkillers except codeine.Day 1 - woke.up and couldn't pee. Had to have a hot bath to relieve this. Feeling of being very swollen. didn't eat much and spent my day on the sofa, uncomfortable but not in agony. Pain managed with Paracetamol and Ibuprofen.Day 2 - struggling to get about and sitting down for too long was super uncomfortable . First BM.. Traumatic to say the least but think the fear of it was worse than the actual experience. Bad night and so took my first codeine and spent half the night sitting in the bath.Day 3 - the worst day so far, the pain ramped up a notch and Painkillers not touching it at all. Very miserable. BM so sore again.Day 4 - a miraculous marked improvement in the pain levels. Managing without codeine. Pottering about really helping and taking my mind off the pain. BM easier.Day 5 - managing only on Ibuprofen. Went to doctors who gave me lactulose, Movicol giving me bad wind and breaking wind isn't the most comfortable! Signed off work for two weeks as sitting down all day isn't advisable. Managed to drive the car with little discomfort.Today is day 6 and last night I only woke once. Have had BM and it was fine. The feeling of needing to go is worse than the experience but nothing awful. Rather a sharp pain and a sense of urgency. Still feeling like I've had a kick up the bottom but not too bad. Overall its going to be worth it as I already feel better down there.My tips for anyone who is having this surgery.."

I am 57 and have had problems with hemorrhoids for years. It was getting to where I was spending two weeks out of the month basicly ok due to constipation from opiate medication I have to take. Then one week where I use the prep H to push the roids back into place. Then often a week of just pain, stool softeners vs pain killers, and out of service.I got refered to a surgeon recently and he said I had a bad case and set me up for surgery. They decided to do a colenistimy (colon probe. where I guess they pump you full of air and put a tube all the way up). I did not know that it was that extensive or I might of gone without it..at least not with this surgery.I was told afterwards that I had some of the largest they had seen. Also the colen test showed some polups they had to burn out. They did not look cancerous.I had trouble gettin cleaned out prior to surgery due to the pain and the opiates. As required I took 250 grams of miralax stool softener, 4 laxitives, and waited. I took them at 4 pm, had surgery lined up for 8:00 am with a 6:00am arrival. The drugs did not take effect until 1:00am so I was up until we had to leave for the hospital still on the tolite..and in severe pain.I was still eliminating when we arrived. I was given a couple of ememas to use on myself. I couldnt hold them but they came out clear so they started the surgery, colen probe, and prostate exam.I awoke after 2 hours of surgery. I was still under the anestisa (I was put out) and not in terriable pain. I got up and was able to urinate. I had packing in me and was told to go home, take a bath, and they would come out. I had terriable cramps and gut pain, prostate pain, and severe anus pain. I have lots of stitches down there.I went home and ate a small bowl of cereal and some oatmeal...and waited. I drank a bunch of juice and water but could not urinate. I was leaking blood everywhere. I took several baths and finally the packing came out. I took stool softeners and drank a lot. Finally the first meal, or what was left over from before, came out in the bath. I didnt have a full bowel push because of the pain but a bunch of crap, in small strings, some packing, and a huge amount of blood came out. I would say a pint.I ate some more: a bacon and cheese bagel, some oatmeal, and stool softeners. I drank a bunch. I also had to take a bunch of painkillers. One the third day I had an involentary bowell push but came up empty. I couldnt take the pain. Blood was still coming out in drips all the time with a small amount of feces. I called the doctor and got more pain killers. I set up a plan last night to have a bowel movement this morning. I ate some more oatmeal after one day without food. I took several sleeping pills and some pain killers to stop the urge to have a bowel movement. I had to get up at 12:00am and take more pain killers to stop an early bowel urge which would come up with nothing as is my experience. I awoke at 7:00am, as planned, and held the pain killers aside. I forced a bowel movement and produced a large pile of soft serve sh*t which was full of blood. There was more to come but, now 6 days out, I was in too much pain to push again.It becomes a real fight to live. I am addicted to painkillers from years of degenertive disk disease and arthrites due to an 80 foot fall in 89. I dont get my refill until the 13th which is 3 more days. I have enough for today. I have stayed away from the long acting pain killers unless I run out. I hope to pass more later today. I will probably try the same procedure.Again, it is the sixth day, and I still cannot walk without using the furniture. I try and move around as much as possible. I have some blood a fecal leakage which I clean up each time with a bath or a soaking wet warm wash cloth. Then I fold a washcloth in half and put in between my swollen cheeks until dry. They shave you down there and the stubble that grows back is very painful to the opposite side. I have never felt such pain. Each day has been a little better except for the third in which I was worse. I would of still done the surgery if this all turns out ok. I will eat better, drink more, and do whatever I have to do to keep this from re-accuring.If you dont hear from me I am ok... or really bad.Good luck."

Thanks for sharing.I am currently on Day 12 from an internal hemorrhoidectomy. I stopped pain killers after the fifth day due to constipation and I believe it does slow down the healing process. Some days it seems like I'm over the hump but today my bum took a beating. I've been paying close attention to what causes my pain each day. There are many factors but the big culprit I think is 1) constipation 2) straining. Pretty obvious I guess considering that's how I got stuck in this rut in the first place. 😃For the most part my bowel movements have been flowing quite well considering I've been eating very healthy. Yesterday I didn't take my stool softener but that caused me to strain more than usual this morning. The bowel movement wasn't the hard part actually. However, about thirty minutes later I felt that hard, dull, heavy, pressure in my anal cavity not to mention the soreness in my bum.I think one of the issues might be that I have some residual lumps around my anus. From what I hear on this board that is quite normal. The problem is that one of them is about the size of a blueberry and it hurts just like an external hemorrhoid. I think because I was straining more than usual this morning that added to the pain. I experienced that pain for about four hours. It's not the most excruciating pain but it does limit my day-to-day activities.So a few questions:How long did it take for the post op lumps around the anus to heal? If it caused you discomfort, how long did it last? Many from what I've read have said weeks which makes me depressed because I just can't stand the discomfort. Plus, I am doing a lot of traveling this summer and will be on some long plane flights.I've been keeping bowel movements to 1-2 per day. I experimented with skipping stool softener because I don't like that it interferes with your gut microbiome. I'm also trying to stay all natural in terms of healing. Another reason was because I was afraid of having anal stenosis so I wanted my stools to be firm. Does anyone know how common anal stenosis is?

"Piles","12 Days Post-Op Hemorrhoidectomy","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/12-days-post-op-hemorrhoidectomy-487697","Let me tell you, this is a very painful experience. Started in my early 20's, developed some nasty habits that made me feel like I had to poop a lot so I spent a lot of time trying to empty an already empty bowel, recipe for disaster. Instead of getting better, it got worse over time. After 5-6 years they were beginning to poke out after every bowel movement, and once I figured out they could be pushed back in, they never really bothered me aside from the occasional bleed or flare-up.Fastforward 8 years later, they have started to poke out on their own, with or without a bowel movement, and pushing them back in no longer works. This is when they start to weigh on your mind and limit your activities, which sucks.I went to a GI surgeon in August thinking maybe I could get a quick band to treat them (had been too embarassed to tell anyone about them until about this time). She took one look and said these are way too big and that I absolutely must get surgery. I had 3 large internals and 1 large external. The experienced surgeon said they were the biggest she's ever seen.So I scheduled my surgery for November, took 5 days off of work which included 5 extra weekend/holiday days, so that I would get a full 10 days to recover.My surgeon showed up about an hour late, so my experience didn't exactly start out with a bang. After awaking post-op I felt zero pain, asked the nurse how it went. They were originally wanting to prescribe me vicodin, however, I asked that my pain medicine and anti-inflammatory could be isolated so that I could take each one appropriately, as needed. I was prescribed oxycodone and instructed to take 3 advil twice a day.I put on my close and hopped it my car (needed help driving home), and was on my way. Unfortunately about 10 minutes into the drive home I started experiencing unbearable pain centering around my tailbone, and my driver had to go to the Doctor's office first to pick up my script since it was a narcotic, leaving me in agonizing pain for about an hour before I could get any type of relief. As strong as oxycodone is, it only helped dull the pain and in no way elminated it. I am astounded people get prescribed such light pain medicines like Tramadol for pain, seems like a crime to me.After the 3rd or 4th day, I was finally able to start feeling better pain-wise. But unfortunately the 3 daily colace I was taking was doing nothing for my constipation. I got to the point where on day 7 I had to poop so bad I couldn't even stand up without having involuntary spasms. I would hop in the bathtub several times a day hoping to get anything out, but nothing would happen. It was the most miserable experience of my life to be that backed up and unable to defecate.After consulting with the surgeon, I started taking Mirilax. The first day it didn't work, but after taking it on day 2 I unleashed the largest, most furious movement anyone has ever seen. I had read online that it really helps to sit in the tub for your first few movements, and believe me when I say they are right. I tried a couple times on the toilet and it caused so much more pain and bleeding. The tub limited the pain and almost eliminated the bleeding.Since then, life has been much more bearable. I'm back to work 11 days later and I no longer require pain meds but they still help post-bowel movement. I am still leaking from the wound, I can't really tell if it's fecal matter or inflammatory stuff or both but it's gross and hoping that subsides soon. I am very careful to ensure I take 1 Tablespoon of fiber before I eat anything, and also take 3 Colace once a day.For anyone thinking about getting this surgery, do it, just be prepared for a little battle. I had my moments of regret but at this point if my recovery continues I think I'm going to be so happy that I finally did something about these little ass devils. "

This is the most vile surgery to recover from as you're expected to poop over and through the surgical site! My first BM was on post op day 4 and the pain almost made me pass out and throw up. Granted, I did not take any pain medication before it, which was a mistake. The description I saw of feeling like you're passing razor blades is true. Luckily, the BM's after that have been progressively more tolerable.Even passing gas hurt initially. The smell of it is extra foul, like something died. Then there's the bleeding and discharge from your rear end.I apologize for being so negative. The main point I want to get across is that this surgery should be your last option after you've tried everything else. I dealt with hemorrhoids for 15 years and had a stapled hemorrhoidectomy in 2015. That procedure failed after 3 good years. My hemorrhoids came back as external and internal grade 3-4.My quality of life was affected and this most recent surgery was my only option to finally be rid of those S.O.B's.I am finally seeing a light at the end of the tunnel, though. Every day is a little bit better. Every BM is a little less horrific.Maybe I'll post an update in a few weeks when I'm more healed and have a better attitude."
"Piles","My surgery story so far ","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-surgery-story-so-far-701907","So I'm a 24 year old male weighing around 182 and my diet is healthy enough I would say. I got my hemorrhoid from helping a relative lift something very heavy and felt pain in my back for a bit and dealt with it. 2 days later I start having pain around my anus and feel a little bump and think it a pimple or something. It grows as the week continues and I just deal with the pain until it unbearable and I look it up and find I have a hemorrhoid. I also found I have two relatives who also do alot of heavy lifting that had hemorrhoids that had to get some sort of procedure done. So I go to my doctor who confirms I had a large thrombosed hemorrhoids and would need to see a specialist. I'm luckily able to schedule a visit in 2 days due to a cancelation. The specialist tells me I could wait it out longer and see if it goes away or she could cut it out. I told her to cut it out since I've been in crazy pain for 10 days now. And she numbed the area up and cut it out all in around 5-10 minutes. I get up feeling great thinking I'll no longer to deal with intense pain like that again. I ask if I can go to go work the next day and was told I could. I was also told just to take over the counter pain killers. I knew there was gonna be some pain since surgery is almost always gonna hurt for a bit.I drive myself home which was only 15 minutes away and took a nap forgetting to take painkillers. 2 hours later when I woke up, I was in so much damn pain. It hurt more or just about the same as the hemorrhoid , but it was a different kind of pain. Those who describe it razer blades being shoved into butt are correct. I lay in pain for a bit and then got up and started to feel weak, sweaty, and dizzy. I stumbled my way to the bathroom trying to figure out what was happening with me. I pulled out the wedge in my butt from post surgery and started to feel better. I think the wedge was in too tight and was clotting something up. Luckily right after that I was able to produce a bm. Which shocked me because I was told I wouldn't ave that for a day or two. And it wasn't too painful like others have described, although there was some blood. After that I sat in a warm bath which seemed to be the only thing that really gave me any relief. I suffered throughout the day and eventually went to bed. I woke up in the morning around 6am and still in alot pain and went to the bathroom and had another bm. It wasn't too bloody or painful either. I went back to bed after some pain and Tylenol Pm.Day 2 and I was still in pain and there was still alot of what seemed to be fecal discharge and blood from my anus. I would be wiping it alot throughout the day with tucks wipes, which I think helped alot. I also took like 5 warm baths and would 1000mg of Tylenol every 6 hrs. By night the pain had gotten alot better but still was painful.Day 3 - I felt so much better and the pain had reduced by alot to where I could cut back on the painkillers a bit. Oh also I noticed while cleaning down there what felt like another bulge that was kinda hard but didn't hurt. My heart dropped and I thought I had another hemorrhoid and couldn't bear the idea of going through all this again mentally and physically. I called my doctors office and waited for a nurse to call me back. The next 5 hours were the most anxious I've been in my life, and I only recently started getting anxcioty after developing the hemorrhoid. Eventually she called me and tells me it's normal and should just be swelling and if it hurts to come back in and they'll see if it's another hemorrhoid. That was a sign of relief and I was back to thinking normal again. However I didn't really have a decent bm even though I've had a decent amount of food. However I think it may be due to the leakage as well. Also when I have to pee, I really have too pee and now fast walk or run to the bathroom. I've been drinking lots of water, but I usually drink a lot of water and never have had this sudden urge to pee. I'm hoping this isn't a permanent thing. Still also taking warm baths when swelling would pick up.Day 4-6 - I was feeling significantly better and even thought I could go to work, however decided not to since the pain would flair up sometimes and I was still getting leakage of blood and fecal. The pain would flair up the most for me during morning around 5 or 6 am and also from around 4-9 pm. I also switched my tucks wipes to prep h wipes after finding they had probane in them. Still taking warm baths recover but only 2 a day opposed to 5. I've also been having this pain in what seems to be my tailbone and I can't seem to figure out why. Hoping it's something post surgery related. I had my surgery on the 8th of May and plan to return to my office job with a standing desk now on the 20th. I've read alot of horror stories here and thought I'd share one that wasn't too bad."

It's fairly painless and i don't notice it unless prodding it. I cannot find anything online to suggest what an internal hemorrhoid feels like-are they very hard lumps and would they have this blueish tinge?

So my concerns are the following: it's already the fourth day and i feel more pain, and have the feeling like by bowels are full and trying to rip out of my torso. I'm taking antibiotics aswell as ketobrufen painkillers every 6 hours or so because It's just to unbearable. I have the urge to visit the toilet very frequently but when I try to push something out only small traces come out (it is soft and without blood though).

So let me briefly explain what has been happening. In February of 2018, I was very ill and my doctor put me on a several rounds of antibiotics along with high daily doses of IBprofen. During this time, I experienced the worst constipation of my life. I was having bowel movements nearly every day but the stool itself was extremely large and difficult to pass. The amount of straining was monumental and the result was a terrible, ripping pain, bright red bleeding on the toilet paper, sides of the stool, and in the toilet bowl. This lasted for weeks before there was improvement.Since that time, I continue to have problems on and off. Weeks will go by with no pain or bleeding and I believe I have finally put it behind me but then a large or ""dry"" stool will immediately re-injure the problem area and I will again see blood on the toilet paper, sides of stool, and in the toilet bowl. I talked to my doctor last month during a routine physical about this apparently chronic and reoccurring issue and he has suggested fiber supplements, increased water intake, stool softeners, topical cream, etc. I had tried many of these things already over the last year. So I have been drinking 2+ liters of water a day and taking fiber supplements as well as eating daily helpings of whole grains, black beans, avacados and other food sources of soluble fiber.Over the last few weeks, however, the problem has only seemed to worsen. And then tonight happened. The bowel movement was again particularly large and difficult to pass and very painful. So I looked down there and this is what I saw. I have never seen this before. Are these external hemmorroids? Right after the bowel movement it was extremely inflamed and looked engorged. An hour later, the ""lumps"" seems less inflamed. Are these ""thrombosed?"" They were certainly bleeding. I could literally see bright red blood coming from them in very small amounts. My apologies for the graphic nature of the pictures.

I have had hemorrhoids since last year, but they were mostly asymptomatic, except for a little blood a couple times when I was really constipated or thought I needed to have a bowel movement and didn't. Until the very end of last year though, I did not have the constant pain, itching, and burning that I have had all of this year now. This pain actually started with unexpectedly needing to have another bowel movement one evening even when I had already had a big one that day, and not from constipation. I have a smaller external one in front of my anus and a bigger one behind that is mostly internal but comes out after a bowel movement. My hemorrhoids only bled twice in January, and within a couple weeks between instances, but multiple times in February and March so far. I did not have a bowel movement for three days until today, because I did not want to have to strain and I am afraid of any more anal bleeding. However, today, before having a bowel movement, I put some hemorrhoid cream on a wipe, which I have also been using instead of toilet paper now, was gentle, and still saw some spots, even though it had been a few days. Is there anything I can do to keep my hemorrhoids from bleeding, and eventually get them to go away? Thanks."

However, over the years, they seem to have grown and it was harder to push them back even though i still don't feel pain or blood.But i am very conscious about having a ""flower"" lumps growing outside my rear though only my partner get to see them, i am still super conscious and i was concern that it will just keep growing and if i get older, it would be harder to go under knife or endure the living hell recovery stage for 2-3 weeks.I googled extensively for local and overseas treatment that i can ""avoid"" sufferings and i came across Tonyo Medical hall in singapore and decided to go for a consultation with my limited mandarin, and brought a local friend with me to help with translation.He told me that i have about 8 internal and external piles altogether but it is not the worst he has seen or treated and assured me that during the whole procedure i would only feel ""ant bite"" pain that last less than few seconds, absoIutely no cutting and i wont be under any GA or LA since TCM doctors are not allow to administer that. i was skeptical of coz and told him i will need time to think about it, neither did he pressure me..I talked to friends that had their piles fixed and they told me about their horrible living hell during their recovery via surgery or ligation. i read many postings here as well that helped me decide too.So in less than a week after the 1st consultation with Dr. Koh, i decided to go along with the procedure, which was 3 days ago (yay, i am now sitting upright and typing this experience while it is fresh on my mind).The first day he managed to treat 6 out of my 8 piles and the next day i went back to do another 2 big ones. Reason why he could not do all in one is because of the position of the 2 huge piles are behind the 6 piles so he needs to get to the front piles first, shrink them in order to proceed to the 2 huge ones. i was super nervous but glad it was what he described, ant bite pain for few seconds on each pile.I came home with little pain and abit of ""discomfort"" as the piles have started shrinking I guess. He advise me to work from home next few days, don't be too active with my walking so not to irritate the piles as it continue shrinking and will eventually fall off.He also gave me some cream to apply and also told me to do sitz bath with salt for few days. i personally took some synflex to manage that little pain on the first night.i went back to him today for examine, and he took out the some piles (i have pics) that have fallen off, just like that. i am still amaze how quick and relatively painless the whole procedure has been.Not sure if there is similar traditional chinese medicine in the states but do check out if possible.i totally lucked out with this work posting to singapore."

All was clear (phew) and they banded 2 haemorrhoids (stage 2) which they attributed the bleeding to.The bleeding continued and i had another couple banded in January just gone.Long story short, I'm still suffering from what i consider heavy bleeding with clots. It happens consistently for 4 to 5 days then stops for a week or two.All this time I've had a dull pulling pain in my lower right abdomen which the consultant dismisses. This pain worsens right before i start bleeding again.I could attach pics but wouldn't want to gross everyone out, but essentially the toilet looks like a blood bath and blood sprays into the toilet followed by fast dripping. When i wipe there are always clots. After flushing there are usually clots still in the bottom of the toilet. During the 4-5 days this can happen 3-4 times per day.I'm just after some reassurance that others with haemorrhoids have similar experiences as i can't help worrying that something more sinister is going on."

I am currently day 9 post op and still in a living nightmare.... This apparently ""less painful"" procedure to fix my grade 3's has given me a lot more than i bargained for...i have seriously never experienced such pain in my life (the fact they gave me morphine to go home with and signed me off for 4 weeks should have rung alarm bells, i know)!!the pain was seriously so bad i had practically taken up residence in the bath tub for just a bit of relief. It was from this bath tub 5 days in that i ended up calling myself an ambulance because this just wasn't right, surely i should be suffering from a pain the butt right, not feeling as if my entire downstairs was about to explode. Added to that my belly looked bigger than it had when i was 7 months pregnant. I just didn't know where to put myself. So off to a&e i go and discover something they never warned me about pre op, urinary retention. Now i knew i was having trouble peeing but thought i was getting most of it out via the bath or my new pee standing up method but clearly not. A catheter was swiftly inserted and they drained 1.5 litres of fluid. This was quite impressive apparently, the most the nurse in a&e had ever seen! There was instant relief. I should mention that i still hadn't had my first post op poo at this point despite taking the laxatives. That soon changed when i got up to the assessment unit and oh my god. armageddon !! The poor nurse, the poor other patients (there was no toilet i could get to in time but luckily a commode)... it wasn't so much the pain i remember but i know i nearly passed out, cold sweats, panic attack the lot. Anyway even though i had this massive release the docs thought that the reason i couldn't pee was because i was backed up so the next day i received not one but two enemas. Now an enema in itself is not so bad, but up a bottom that had just had hemmorhoid surgery? well i was staring to think these people were sadists! But this was still to no avail and i simply could not pee. The catheter went back in and they threatened to send me home with it for 2 weeks hoping that when my bottom was better my bladder would start behaving itself. I was not looking forward to this prospect at all. Anyway long story short the next day the pain in the but was a little less and i managed to pee and got released catheter free, hurrah. Now for the next problem, since coming home i cannot stop going to the toilet. i have constant diarrhea. Is this a hang over from the enemas? i don't know but i wish it would stop!! i'm not taking laxatives at the moment because literally everything i eat is going straight through me 😦 this is obviously not helping with the sore bum situation. Has anyone else experienced this? It just seems to be one thing after another. i'm sure with any other op i've had after 9 days i've been pretty much back to normal...

So I've been battling pain, swelling, and a couple thromboses for months. I thought I had prolapsing hemmorhoids, got them banded but my condition more or less remained, and in fact got worse. So here's where I'm at as of today:I start my day pretty normally, but swell up as it wears on. Yesterday I went for a walk and pretty quickly felt a lump develop back there. I went home and sure enough saw a purple bulge or bubble that could easily pass for a thrombosed hemorrhoid. Great. But here's where it gets interesting: I laid down and literally over the course of 15 minutes it shrank into invisibility. I have had these happen a few times now. I'll swell up, get a bubble, sometimes two, sometimes on the right, sometimes on the left, sometimes on both sides. And when I lay down, they shrink away. Very odd behavior.My doctor is baffled. He says hemmorhoids don't do that and when he examines me he says I don't have external hemorrhiods. It's just swelling. Okay, great. WHY AM I SWELLING?I'm now at the point where I've begun to investigate a different approach: pelvic floor physical therapy. I've been a few times and I find it promising. I clearly have very tight muscles down there and symptoms of nerve pain (burning mostly). I wonder if the swelling is related? Bad circulation from pelvic floor dysfunction? Neurogenic inflammation from a compressed pudendal nerve? Who knows? But my regular doctor is confused, and has nothing to cut, so that means I have to embrace this pelvic pt approach whole hog. I have no other choice unless I want a master of Chinese medicine to wave ginseng at me or something.Anyone heard of anything like this? Daily swelling and ass bubbles that shrink when you lie down?"

I was very nervous about doing it after reading so many bad stories, but my hemorrhoids had gotten to the point where they were stage 3 which meant that they pushed out and needed to be manually pushed back in. This was starting to happen not only when I had a BM but when I was exercising or hiking, and sometimes in the evenings, just because! I was at a point where I couldn't do the things I loved to do, like camping, hiking, traveling etc. I'm a 70 year old women in good physical shape.Operation day: my surgeon did not instruct me to do any prep beyond not using any blood thinning medication for two weeks before the operation. I assumed that he would do an enima before operating. He did not. The operation itself and afterwards was very painful even though I was given a anesthesia and oxycodone. I slept through the 2 hour drive home, and was very sick by the time we arrived - reminding me that I have had reactions to codeine. After taking the medication for two days I stopped and only took acetaminophen and later ibuprofen every 6 hours.Day 2: I started taking my prescribed stool softeners and fiber, plus followed a very high fiber diet. I drank 64 oz of water daily. Because it was too painful to sit down, I did a lot of walking in the house every day, and out side when the weather was nice. Sitz baths and tub baths 3-5 times a day for 10-15 minutes each, plus warm and cold compresses.Day 3: I had my first Bowel Movement, and yes it was very painful, but quick. Urinating was also difficult at first, but I found it less painful and easier to pee in the sitz bath, clean the bowl and then do my soak.By day 6 my bowel movements were less painful. I still could not sit comfortably until 1 1/2 weeks passed.today - week 3, I am still slightly swollen down there and tender, but can sit for longer periods of time and am having normal BMS.My advise to anyone going through this.Be sure to pick the best colon/rectal surgeon you can find.Stick to a high fiber diet for the first couple weeks. No red meat, white bread, white rice, alcohol, fatty foods. I am still doing the fiber supplements twice a day.Drink no less than 64 oz of water dailyI was advised to not put anything on the area. The first week I was told to put a cotton square between my butt cheeks to absorb any drainage. I keep it clean now by stepping into the shower after a bm and using my hair dryer on cool to dry the area. It is important to keep the surgical area clean and dry.Exercise often. In the beginning walk, walk, walk. At week 3 I am able to do my daily morning workouts that include elliptical machine, light free weights and yoga stretches. In the afternoons I am back to walking outside for an hour daily.My surgeon says the swelling should reduce within a month, and the tenderness along with it. I am so relieved that the operation was easier to go through then I scared myself into, AND I am so glad to not have those pesky hemorrhoids in my life any more!!"
"Piles","Conflicting Diagnoses","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/conflicting-diagnoses-691607","Hey, so I've posted on here before about a long, difficult post-banding recovery (2 thrombosed externals that may or may not have been related to the banding and which appeared in the following two months, one after the other). Now that those have resolved, I've still got redness, swelling, and discomfort. What is going on?Well if you believe my regular colorectal surgeon, I have pruritus ani (chronically irritated bum) likely from overzealous cleaning and all the craziness that's been going on back there. (That does jive with my recent behavior if I'm being honest.) He says I need to use a zinc oxide barrier cream for a few weeks to calm the skin and return it to a healthy, happy state.Fine. Sounds good.On a lark, I visited another colorectal surgeon just to see what a different expert would say. Full disclosure: she was very rude and dismissive, annoyed that I was asking her to ""co-manage"" my treatment. She said I had ""engorged external hemorrhoids"" even though I'd never had them before. She then went on to suggest the banding somehow caused it, and finally just for fun, she said there was nothing I could do about it. I asked about surgery. She said it was risky and painful. Wonderful trip.I ran what she said by my regular guy over the phone and he said that's nuts, in no uncertain terms. I don't have some some brand new external hemorrhoids. Banding doesn't do that. He's seen me from the beginning of my treatment and has not noticed anything like that. Just plenty of irritation--something he sees regularly and is confident we can cure. He also said he couldn't even operate on me if he wanted to--there's nothing to operate on! I just need to stick with calming the skin down and I'll be fine.In his defense, there is nothing on the internet anywhere to suggest banding causes external hemorrhoids. And I have looked long and hard.In her defense, I did have those thromboses, though they did subside. And I am pretty swollen down there, no two ways about it. But pruritus ani does inflame the skin.So, what do you think? Who is right?I'm obviously inclined to believe my usual doctor since he's seen me a lot more and isn't a total jerk. Plus he bands people all the time and has never ever seen what the other doctor described (who doesn't perform banding FYI, just injections).But just curious if people have thoughts. What a crazy day."

A few weeks ago I visited my GP as I have had several episodes of bleeding which usually last about five days. He gave me a digital rectal examination and advised me that I had a small smooth lump in the rectum. He put me on the two week hospital referral but said I shouldn't worry as most problems like this turn out to be non cancerous.A few weeks later I underwent a colonoscopy and whilst my colon was completely clear of any signs of cancer, the endoscopist wrote on his report ""query sub mucosal lipoma"" in respect of the lump. He said that he was referring me for an endoscopic ultrasound scan to further investigate the lump.A few weeks later I received a letter from the gastro consultant advising me that the colonoscopy was satisfactory and no further investigation was required.Having googled sub mucosal lipoma, i am led to believe this is a benign fatty cyst which is generally harmless but if allowed to grow, could potentially obstruct the bowel and require emergency surgery.I am concerned that the endoscopist used the word ""query"" which I take to mean that he wasnt sure that it was a lipoma and further investigation was required to confirm this, but the consultant seems to think otherwise.Should I now sit back and wait in the hope that the lump doesnt get bigger, or possibly be something more serious?Another concern I have is with the frequent bleeding from my rectum, is it possible to get an infection in my blood from the nasty bacteria in the bowel?"

I went to see a Colorectal Surgeon today in NYC. He is a top doc in this field, I’ve know him for some years now. He did not perform my hemorrhoidectomy in 2018 but I have been having some residual issues now 6 months later. I him to do an exam and tell me what’s what. I learned some things.First of all, it is not unusual to have residual effects for months after. In fact, many people are not fully healed until after a year. The worst is usually over in the 8-10 week timeframe on average. But lingering issues can remain much much longer.Second, whatever you do, get this surgery done by an expert in the field! A colorectal surgeon who is well regarded. The doc who did mine last summer is a well regarded colorectal surgeon. However I was informed today of some unfortunate cases where “corrections” had to me made, and not always successfully.The long term prognosis is good. A hemorrhoidectomy is the suggested approach in some instances, like mine. It is important to go in with eyes wide open! It can take up to one year for full recovery. Don’t be misled.I had a kind of incontinence problem. Turns out this is not uncommon at all. It’s not really incontinence, it’s more of a healing pattern that impacts BMs. In my case he expects it to resolve in 2019 without any further surgery.Anyway I just thought to pass this on."

Amost 9 weeks post surgery and some improvement but not enough for the amt of time thats passed, even my surgeon said so. I am still on 1-2 painkillers a day, always after bm's. Even an easy bm and a bath and cream applied and only lying down in my sides (still) because I still cannot lay on my back for the bottom pain and pressure and sitting is still minimal (no more than 30 min at one time or I pay for it), I need a pain pill to get through rest of the day. I am not constipated. Dr says the external looks good and healing well so probs must be internal. I have not been scoped...I think the prob may be too many bm's not allowing my internal anus to heal. Has anyone else had gastrointestinal issued pretty bad since having this surgery? I literally poop every time I eat anything. I have found NOTHING that my body can digest and stay in my system for at least a day before a bm is needed. Its as if Ive developed IBS but thats impossible, right? Ive lost over 20 pounds already just from not being able to eat w/o almost immediate bm (which causes pain afterward for hours). Even soup. Im terrified of food now, but I get hungry and take a chance on eating a little something, hoping it wont tear my stomach up, but it does. They are gonna do an abdominal ultrasound soon to check my gallbladder or for gastritis or some stomach ailment thats contributing to my belly pain and inability to eat w/o going to bathroom. EXAMPLE: I ate a small bowl of chicken stew on a very cold rainy day. The next day I pooped 7 times, and all of it was the stew...REALLY??? Whats happening to me? My rectum will never heal and I will never be rid of this horrible pain if my bm's dont slow down. Could this be my gallbladder?

None of that worked and after 3 glorious weeks of no prolapsing post op they all just popped right back up. They where a little bit smaller than before surgery which bought me some time, but all present and accounted for... Regarding THD: If you're considering it, I would think twice if you have a grade 3 (prolapsing every time you poop and needed to be reinserted manually) because I just don't think that procedure is up to the job. I think for grade 2 and below though, it's could maybe work. However, the ""48 hour back at work"" line they feed you is complete nonsense as many others have said. I'll obviously be able to make comparisons a bit more directly in about 12 hours, but to me it seemed a lot like the hemorrhoidectomy recovery stories I've read on here. Severe pain/ bleeding for 2 weeks, living in the tub, etc, etc.I've been just dealing with my situation as best I can since then but over the last 3 years I developed Prostatitis. My GP would treat it with antibiotics for a month, it would go away and then it would come back like clockwork a year later, which is very bizarre for an other wise healthy 29 year old male. My working theory (not a doctor by any means, just a research freak) is that the hemorrhoids are somehow causing this. I wonder if I'm getting infected when the hemorrhoids are tearing and bleeding or if just the enormous size of them is pushing on my prostate. Either way, here's hoping the procedure fixes that problem too. I'm also lucky enough to have gotten an IBS diagnosis in the last year, which has obviously aggravated things greatly. Ironically I think it was all the on again, off again antibiotic stints that really kicked it off for me. Generally it presents itself as violent diarrhea fits/ gas attacks. As a result of that, I lost quite a bit of weight, down from 190 lbs (I'm 6ft tall) to now 162 lbs pre-surgery. I had a gazziion tests with a GI specialist (colonoscopy, CT scan with contrast, every blood/urine/poop test imaginable) but all came back negative and I wound up with an IBS diagnosis and a surgery referral. So... That all brings me to 11am tomorrow morning when I finally face my biggest fear and get the dreaded surgery. Leading up to it, I've opted to purchase just about every single ""tip and trick"" I've seen on here. I've got a toilet sitz bath, a lifetime supply of stool softener, baby wipes, underwear liners, adult diapers, 8 pounds of epsom salt, a heating pad and a new obnoxiously large TV in my bedroom and another in the bathroom. I haven't had cable in years but if ever there was a time... The one thing I'm doing a little differently is that while I've been taking stool softeners for about 3 weeks leading up to this (1 Collace a day then 2 a day starting 3 days before the op), I haven't been taking a fiber supplement like many others have. I'm going to very, very slowly introduce some (benefiber) in if I'm having trouble initially but with my IBS, I'm extremely sensitive to it. I remember after my 1st op passing gas was a nightmare for the first few days and fiber has a good chance for me of triggering a gas attack. I think for most people without this problem, ramping up the fiber for a few weeks before this and also starting stool softeners about a week early (I was on them longer just because of the pain I was already in) is a good plan. I have another type of stool softener (I would take it in addition to Collace), miralax, milk of magnesia and gas-x ready to roll should they be needed as well. Surgeon is prescribing Oxycotton and Valium for post op pain. I'll also be taking the max dose of IB proffin. I found that was a miracle drug for me last time around. The opioids help ""take you out of it"" but the IB proffin was the only thing able to directly touch the pain. Valium will help with spasms and will hopefully make me not worry as much about that first poop... I've also made some extremely potent marijuana edibles with a 50/50 ratio of CBD/ THC to use (I live in a legal state) I'll mix in as needed. I'd like to get off the painkillers and switch to those as soon as I can to avoid opioid constipation. I ate a small PB&J this morning and have stuck to just water (lots of it) until the surgery about 24 hours later. Dr didn't recommend enema, laxative prep beforehand, so I'm going with her opinion on that one but also trying to make sure I'm going in with a fairly empty tank. After the procedure I'm planning on sticking with soups, chicken stock, yogurt for as long as I can take it (probably 2 days if I'm a gambling man) and then ramping up to some fruits (watermelon, pear, cantaloupe) and avocado toast/ sandwiches (no cheese). I've got a fantastic girlfriend who took 9 days off work to take care of me during the post op and while I work from home, I booked myself 2 weeks completely off the grid just in case as well. I was dead set on getting a colo-rectal specialist, but the insurance I have (Kaiser) will only do the procedure with a General Surgeon. I'm a bit nervous about that part, but I like my Dr. a lot and I do trust her. It's still a bit unknown what she'll actually do during the procedure. When I went in for the consult, I was in so much pain she was only able to do a rectal exam for a few seconds before making the recommendation for the OP (mostly based on my extensive history). She thinks the sharp pain I currently have is the result of a fissure but I think it might be a thrombosed hemorrhoid. I've ""ok'ed"" a botox injection fissure treatment (she doesn't want to do a sphinctorectamy at the same time) but we're sort of playing that one by ear after she gets in there and sees whats going on. She's also very worried about stenosis (narrowing of the anal canal) if she does too much cutting at once, so she's mentioned leaving 1 in there (I have 3) and then going back in for a second procedure in a few months. That by far is I think my biggest fear going into this tomorrow, that I wake up and still have a prolapsing hemorrhoid. Prolapsing through the wound seems like the worst pain imaginable and I really hope that's not what happens! I trust her to make the right call for my well being though during this, which is really all I can do at this point. I'll be posting updates as I go along here, so feel free to follow along. Without the countless hours I've spent reading on this forum, I don't know if I'd have had the courage to do this, so it's the least I can do to pay it forward. If you have any questions or advice on what I'm planning post-op, I'd love to hear them. Here's to better days (soon I hope....) "

I had one area of pain, left side, 9 o'clock but also felt pain in my foot and in my penis and testicles.

The 12 mile drive home was endless and I felt every bump in the road.On arriving home I got straight into the bath. I found I had a jelly plug in my butt, which came out with little effort. It was stained brown with old blood. My back passage feels totally different, like its not mine. I usually have a skin tag on the right side but that seems to be missing and replaced with one on the left instead. The 'hole' also seems much further set in than usual, like it's maybe gone back into its proper position. It is all very odd.I had real trouble passing urine but that seems a little easier now. I have only passed wind once, which didn't hurt too much. I am absolutely terrified of pooping, the pain on the left is so bad I'm scared I'll pass out.

Told myself I'd write one of these after the first op, and it's now fresh in my mind + got a lot of free time so here I am!TLDR: Experiences like these were particularly helpful for me:https://www.quora.com/How-successful-is-hemorrhoid-surgery-1 (this explains why 2 ops)https://patient.info/forums/discuss/haemorrhoidectomy-sharing-the-experience-497818And in order of priority:And now my experience(s):BACKGROUNDI'm in this position because I had constipation type issues a lot while younger and ignored the warning signs (bleeding, stage 2 prolapsing). Probably inherited poor digestion from my mum with Crohns, but exacerbated it with a diet of coffee, alcohol (= chronic dehydration) and evening junk food through my 20s. Come my late 20s and I'm pushing them back in after every BM, sometimes they won't stay in, they keep flaring up with soreness and I'm basing my socialising around how long I'm going to have to stand for and how hard the chairs will be.So I went to my GP when it started actually keeping me from work, they gave me lactulose to get me regular and told me to eat + drink properly. You may need to do this before they let you have the op as the hems will return without those good habits, and you don't want to go through the op if management will suffice. You'll certainly want your regular, healthy bowel movement routine to be established by the time of the op. For me that means strong black coffee and a few bran flakes every morning to get things going; my body now 'expects' this and it makes the worst (but most important, see above) part of recovery more predictable. (Also I eat a lot of veg/fibre and drink a lot of water through the day which is also necessary, fibre intake in particular though you shouldn't just 'spring' on your body immediately before or after surgery, it needs building up over time beforehand).The healthy diet allowed me to put off surgery for another couple of years but it was still ultimately a drag on my life (and actually getting me down more than I acknowledged at the time - I am one of many who say ""why didn't I address this sooner?""). So I went ARMED WITH A VIDEO TO SHOW THE GP OF MY HEMS at their worst state i.e. immediately post-BM. I'd had a few appointments and a proctoscopy in between where it seemed the doctor wasn't appreciating how bad they were, because in my case they didn't always look that way. If you ""wish the GP could see how bad it gets when they're not there to inspect it"", take a video and show them. When they saw the extent of my prolapsing and heard my now very cut-down, clear, and frank description of what I was suffering from they waved me through to a surgeon's appointment. GPs are too busy nowadays and trying to do quick assessments based on imperfect information. If you come armed with a clear (internet educated) understanding of what's wrong and what outcome you're after, it increases their ability to make the best decisions for you. I am not saying at all that you should 'override' them or you can't trust their judgement, quite the opposite, but it took me a few goes to learn what information best helps them make that judgement, and how to give it to them clearly.The surgeon also saw that video, inspected me, rated my hems as severe and warned that the shape of my hems can complicate treatment options. They formed a circular doughnut all the way round which prolapsed out mostly during BMs, so not the classic long 'polyp' hanging out but instead loose skin all the way round my anus which would balloon up, get trapped, and become a nightmare every few weeks. These are complicated because the integrity of that perianal tissue is very important - surgeons worry about causing incontinence or stenosis if they just hack it away. It turns out I had the internal hems too, and these need removing separately from the 'secondary' perianal hems / skin tags to avoid too much thinning of skin / scarring all at once. The top link above describes this and is why I needed two ops.The first line treatment was banding of internal hems although the surgeon warned mine were probably past that point, and he was right. They were bad as ever after a couple of months so back I went (another negotiating-the-NHS tip: these surgeon appointments were booked many weeks in advance, so don't put off going to the doctor on the assumption that things will happen as soon as you've told your GP you've had enough. There may well be months of waiting for appointments and the eventual surgery. Get the ball rolling sooner rather than later).SURGERYHe recommended the standard ""open"" (Milligan-Morgan) hemorrhoidectomy, but I was afraid of the painful recovery and having heard of the newer HALO (Haemorrhoid Artery Ligation Operation) I asked for that instead. He said he wasn't sure of the appropriateness of that for my hem shape but transferred me to a surgeon at Circle who could do it.On the morning of the op I met that new surgeon who persuaded me away from HALO. He said that for all the quicker and relatively painless recovery HALO promises, the excess hemorrhoidal tissue that would otherwise be removed needs to be stapled back up inside. 'Early adopters' are now coming back 1-2 years later having initially recovered fine, with complications from the stapling such as its breaking away from the rectal wall that needs repeated reconstructive work. By contrast the standard ""open"" procedure is incredibly well practiced and potential complications thoroughly understood + minimised. By that point I wanted whatever most decisively solved the problem so Milligan-Morgan it was.If you've never had an operation before, a) everyone's dead keen on making sure you're the correct patient, that you can describe them what op you're expecting to have, and you have no risk factors like loose teeth or drug allergies. You get asked the same questions over and over again, and they confirm with each other that stuff in theatre at the beginning just to make triple sure everyone's on the same page. It's a well oiled machine that's very mistake-averse. b) General anaesthesia just feels like nothing, not even a 'blank spot' in memory. One minute they're telling you to breathe deeply and the next minute they're calling your name to wake you up. In between they will have pushed a breathing tube down your throat and taken a knife to your arse, but you will not have to 'experience' any of this at all. In fact the drugs take awhile to wear off so you'll wake up feeling pretty fine if not slightly chipper relative to the apprehension going in. As the link above says though, this is a lie, the pain will come once the anaesthesia wears off.The surgeon described what he'd done very shortly after I returned to my cubicle and I was still coming round really. I could have done with a dictaphone or third person writing it down as he was trying to explain what he'd removed and why he couldn't do it all in one go (see above) while I was, it turns out, about to faint from not eating and general shock to the system (+ my fairly low blood pressure). Biscuits and hot chocolate with added sugar sorted that right out, and for my second op I warned the nurses this might happen so they had something sweet and a drink ready for me.I got picked up and went home to bed to sleep off the anaesthesia. They prescribed me paracetamol, ibroprufen, dihydrocodeine, senna (laxative) and an anti-emetic. I only used the first two because opiates cause constipation (again, regular healthy BMs are most important), I've found laxatives to be too harsh on my bowel like the second link above, and I didn't get nauseous. But the ibroprufen and paracetamol were very useful. Like several others, I ended up taking them before bed to sleep better, and about an hour before I was due to go to the toilet (i.e. when I woke up) so they kicked in ready for that. But otherwise ""listen to your body"" applies, I took them when I felt I needed it, this was coming up against the daily dosage limits in the first few days but fell back to only occasionally after a week or so.My recovery following both the first op and this one (so far) have been similar. In the first couple of days I felt ""rough"" like I'd just been drugged and injured. My GF said I looked pale. On days 2-5 I shuffled round the house a little, mainly in the living room rather than bed-bound, but returned to bed if it was too painful to sit, after bowel movements, or just when I felt like I wanted a rest. In the first 48 hours or so that whole area feels inflamed up like a cricket ball behind your gooch. It ranges from dull ache like you've been kicked hard, up to sharp stabs like there's an open wound in there being shifted about (there is). Right now I am sitting sideways on one cheek in my armchair. After 3 days it still feels tender/sore but the inflammation is down.My approach to that whole area is to just accommodate it and not interfere with it while it recovers, but keep it clean. If it gets too sore I take a lukewarm shower / sitz bath. Often I will have several of these in a day, it is at least as helpful as painkillers, I'd say more so. I don't put anything in the water except bath salts and I don't touch or wipe the area directly, just wash with clear running water. Afterward I dry it with a cool hair-dryer, again because keeping it clean + dry is important but you don't want to be rubbing it with towels.I leaked blood and mucous for several days (still am now on day 3) and you risk ruining clothes and furniture unless you keep absorbent padding in your underwear. Lots of people seem to use sanitary towels, I am using a little surgical tape to keep kitchen towel in place while I shuffle about. I replace it several times a day to keep things clean. I bought several extra packs of boxer shorts and have thrown a few away already. I am wearing tracksuit bottoms with a comfortable elastic waistband that I similarly don't mind messing up. Again, you want to focus on being comfortable and recovering, not having to worry about things like messy clothes.After 2 weeks following my first op, I was basically walking around like normal and debating whether to go back to work. I probably could have done except for the risk of a 'difficult' bowel movement at work - I wasn't quite ready to forego the shower and sitz bath in case I needed it, or being able to shout a bit during the act itself without worrying anyone. After 3 weeks I was definitely OK though and way too bored to stay home any longer. I walked gently and didn't exercise or lift anything for a couple of months after, to be sure. If I'd gone back to heavy lifting on day 1 of return to work I probably would have busted it all open again I think, but I was perfectly capable of walking 20mins there/back and doing a desk job. There were no painkillers or painful bowel movements by that point.Bowel movements post-opThis gets its own section because I found it the most painful but necessary part of the recovery process. You use that part of you a lot, and it needs to heal up in the circumstances under which it will be used. If you don't go regularly even while the wound is fresh and raw, you risk bad scarring and stenosis. My surgeons were not so worried about incontinence (a concern of mine but now very rare), or operative complications, but they repeatedly warned of stenosis. If the canal heals up too tight through scarring or insufficient tissue left behind, you're looking at repeated and possibly doomed attempts to rectify it via graded 'dilators' (they are what they sound like) fighting the tissue's tendency to re-scar back up. Get your new arse accustomed to its job early on.This is an issue because it hurts so much people can become basically phobic and avoidant of going to the loo. The laxatives can serve to force it in the first few days. You cannot afford to hold it in and become constipated, because the effect on your (attempted, eventual) bowel movements is antagonistic to recovery and surely much, much worse. The ideal opposite is a body thoroughly used to vegetables, fibre and hydration, with that diet - less fatty and refined foods, probably softer e.g. slow cooked - continuing after surgery, and the regular pattern of soft, effortless BMs therefore following. A maybe gentler version of your usual roughage diet basically.Another thing that lowered the fear factor for me is arriving at a post-BM 'routine' which I knew was optimal for bringing the pain back down and which (although it might take awhile sometimes and longer initially) would always bring it to a close eventually. Then the event itself is ideally just a smooth, predictable and decisive element of a longer process otherwise made of relief. Probably for you the exact steps will differ, again ""listen to your body"" and accommodate it etc.So I've doubled up ibroprufen and paracetamol about an hour ago, eaten my bran and drank my coffee, and I can feel the usual urgency. I take my clothes off and start the shower on lukewarm. I do the deed by 'letting go' not 'pushing' at all, one great check I've read on here is you need to be breathing through your mouth, not holding your breath. These are all good habits you'll need to continue anyway, so again good to have down before the op. I shout/scream a bit especially in the first few days - easier to just do it than stifle/worry, and the GF's usually out at that point in the morning anyway. It will bleed, and surgical packing/gauze will probably come out the first time.I don't attempt to wipe with anything but transfer straight to the shower. Might still be bleeding at this point but if I'm done I'd rather have the water stemming it than be sat there waiting in pain. Eventually I will sit down in a sitz bath. Whatever combination of shower head and bath then continues until I'm done/bored.In the first few days my behind is still too tender to sit down following that, and it can be draining, so I dry off (as above), reapply clean padding and go back to bed for a little bit. And that's it. That's the most taxing bit of the day over with.For me it was worst initially and got/gets better every day. It sounds like for some their 'worst' is the second or third day in"

These are complicated because the integrity of that perianal tissue is very important - surgeons worry about causing incontinence or stenosis if they just hack it away. It turns out I had the internal hems too, and these need removing separately from the 'secondary' perianal hems / skin tags to avoid too much thinning of skin / scarring all at once. The top link above describes this and is why I needed two ops.The first line treatment was banding of internal hems although the surgeon warned mine were probably past that point, and he was right. They were bad as ever after a couple of months so back I went (another negotiating-the-NHS tip: these surgeon appointments were booked many weeks in advance, so don't put off going to the doctor on the assumption that things will happen as soon as you've told your GP you've had enough. There may well be months of waiting for appointments and the eventual surgery. Get the ball rolling sooner rather than later).SURGERYHe recommended the standard ""open"" (Milligan-Morgan) hemorrhoidectomy, but I was afraid of the painful recovery and having heard of the newer HALO (Haemorrhoid Artery Ligation Operation) I asked for that instead. He said he wasn't sure of the appropriateness of that for my hem shape but transferred me to a surgeon at Circle who could do it.On the morning of the op I met that new surgeon who persuaded me away from HALO. He said that for all the quicker and relatively painless recovery HALO promises, the excess hemorrhoidal tissue that would otherwise be removed needs to be stapled back up inside. 'Early adopters' are now coming back 1-2 years later having initially recovered fine, with complications from the stapling such as its breaking away from the rectal wall that needs repeated reconstructive work. By contrast the standard ""open"" procedure is incredibly well practiced and potential complications thoroughly understood + minimised. By that point I wanted whatever most decisively solved the problem so Milligan-Morgan it was.If you've never had an operation before, a) everyone's dead keen on making sure you're the correct patient, that you can describe them what op you're expecting to have, and you have no risk factors like loose teeth or drug allergies. You get asked the same questions over and over again, and they confirm with each other that stuff in theatre at the beginning just to make triple sure everyone's on the same page. It's a well oiled machine that's very mistake-averse. b) General anaesthesia just feels like nothing, not even a 'blank spot' in memory. One minute they're telling you to breathe deeply and the next minute they're calling your name to wake you up. In between they will have pushed a breathing tube down your throat and taken a knife to your arse, but you will not have to 'experience' any of this at all. In fact the drugs take awhile to wear off so you'll wake up feeling pretty fine if not slightly chipper relative to the apprehension going in. As the link above says though, this is a lie, the pain will come once the anaesthesia wears off.The surgeon described what he'd done very shortly after I returned to my cubicle and I was still coming round really. I could have done with a dictaphone or third person writing it down as he was trying to explain what he'd removed and why he couldn't do it all in one go (see above) while I was, it turns out, about to faint from not eating and general shock to the system (+ my fairly low blood pressure). Biscuits and hot chocolate with added sugar sorted that right out, and for my second op I warned the nurses this might happen so they had something sweet and a drink ready for me.I got picked up and went home to bed to sleep off the anaesthesia. They prescribed me paracetamol, ibroprufen, dihydrocodeine, senna (laxative) and an anti-emetic. I only used the first two because opiates cause constipation (again, regular healthy BMs are most important), I've found laxatives to be too harsh on my bowel like the second link above, and I didn't get nauseous. But the ibroprufen and paracetamol were very useful. Like several others, I ended up taking them before bed to sleep better, and about an hour before I was due to go to the toilet (i.e. when I woke up) so they kicked in ready for that. But otherwise ""listen to your body"" applies, I took them when I felt I needed it, this was coming up against the daily dosage limits in the first few days but fell back to only occasionally after a week or so.My recovery following both the first op and this one (so far) have been similar. In the first couple of days I felt ""rough"" like I'd just been drugged and injured. My GF said I looked pale. On days 2-5 I shuffled round the house a little, mainly in the living room rather than bed-bound, but returned to bed if it was too painful to sit, after bowel movements, or just when I felt like I wanted a rest. In the first 48 hours or so that whole area feels inflamed up like a cricket ball behind your gooch. It ranges from dull ache like you've been kicked hard, up to sharp stabs like there's an open wound in there being shifted about (there is). Right now I am sitting sideways on one cheek in my armchair. After 3 days it still feels tender/sore but the inflammation is down.My approach to that whole area is to just accommodate it and not interfere with it while it recovers, but keep it clean. If it gets too sore I take a lukewarm shower / sitz bath. Often I will have several of these in a day, it is at least as helpful as painkillers, I'd say more so. I don't put anything in the water except bath salts and I don't touch or wipe the area directly, just wash with clear running water. Afterward I dry it with a cool hair-dryer, again because keeping it clean + dry is important but you don't want to be rubbing it with towels.I leaked blood and mucous for several days (still am now on day 3) and you risk ruining clothes and furniture unless you keep absorbent padding in your underwear. Lots of people seem to use sanitary towels, I am using a little surgical tape to keep kitchen towel in place while I shuffle about. I replace it several times a day to keep things clean. I bought several extra packs of boxer shorts and have thrown a few away already. I am wearing tracksuit bottoms with a comfortable elastic waistband that I similarly don't mind messing up. Again, you want to focus on being comfortable and recovering, not having to worry about things like messy clothes.After 2 weeks following my first op, I was basically walking around like normal and debating whether to go back to work. I probably could have done except for the risk of a 'difficult' bowel movement at work - I wasn't quite ready to forego the shower and sitz bath in case I needed it, or being able to shout a bit during the act itself without worrying anyone. After 3 weeks I was definitely OK though and way too bored to stay home any longer. I walked gently and didn't exercise or lift anything for a couple of months after, to be sure. If I'd gone back to heavy lifting on day 1 of return to work I probably would have busted it all open again I think, but I was perfectly capable of walking 20mins there/back and doing a desk job. There were no painkillers or painful bowel movements by that point.Bowel movements post-opThis gets its own section because I found it the most painful but necessary part of the recovery process. You use that part of you a lot, and it needs to heal up in the circumstances under which it will be used. If you don't go regularly even while the wound is fresh and raw, you risk bad scarring and stenosis. My surgeons were not so worried about incontinence (a concern of mine but now very rare), or operative complications, but they repeatedly warned of stenosis. If the canal heals up too tight through scarring or insufficient tissue left behind, you're looking at repeated and possibly doomed attempts to rectify it via graded 'dilators' (they are what they sound like) fighting the tissue's tendency to re-scar back up. Get your new arse accustomed to its job early on.This is an issue because it hurts so much people can become basically phobic and avoidant of going to the loo. The laxatives can serve to force it in the first few days. You cannot afford to hold it in and become constipated, because the effect on your (attempted, eventual) bowel movements is antagonistic to recovery and surely much, much worse. The ideal opposite is a body thoroughly used to vegetables, fibre and hydration, with that diet - less fatty and refined foods, probably softer e.g. slow cooked - continuing after surgery, and the regular pattern of soft, effortless BMs therefore following. A maybe gentler version of your usual roughage diet basically.Another thing that lowered the fear factor for me is arriving at a post-BM 'routine' which I knew was optimal for bringing the pain back down and which (although it might take awhile sometimes and longer initially) would always bring it to a close eventually. Then the event itself is ideally just a smooth, predictable and decisive element of a longer process otherwise made of relief. Probably for you the exact steps will differ, again ""listen to your body"" and accommodate it etc.So I've doubled up ibroprufen and paracetamol about an hour ago, eaten my bran and drank my coffee, and I can feel the usual urgency. I take my clothes off and start the shower on lukewarm. I do the deed by 'letting go' not 'pushing' at all, one great check I've read on here is you need to be breathing through your mouth, not holding your breath. These are all good habits you'll need to continue anyway, so again good to have down before the op. I shout/scream a bit especially in the first few days - easier to just do it than stifle/worry, and the GF's usually out at that point in the morning anyway. It will bleed, and surgical packing/gauze will probably come out the first time.I don't attempt to wipe with anything but transfer straight to the shower. Might still be bleeding at this point but if I'm done I'd rather have the water stemming it than be sat there waiting in pain. Eventually I will sit down in a sitz bath. Whatever combination of shower head and bath then continues until I'm done/bored.In the first few days my behind is still too tender to sit down following that, and it can be draining, so I dry off (as above), reapply clean padding and go back to bed for a little bit. And that's it. That's the most taxing bit of the day over with."

And i think soon after that i noticed a lump and bleeding after bowel movements. Due to personal reasons I decided not to tell anyone and ignore it, hoping it would go away.Fast forward to now 11 years later and i still have an external kind of squishy lump just in front of the anus and a small hard thing (like the end of a pen) at the opposite side of the anus. They themselves don't cause pain unless i catch them, but in the last year every couple of months i get a deep pain in the rectum that keeps me awake for a few hours until it eases. I get blood in my stool and on tissue paper with certain bowel movements but not all the time.I've been diagnosed with coeliac disease and IBS but when asked about bleeding and things like that I denied it as I didn't want them to suggest an examination.So I guess I'm asking what people would suggest. I know you can't give me a diagnosis etc, but I'm wondering if I can just leave it as it's not causing big problems at the min, or if I'm better off getting it checked and confirmed as not a problem.Sorry if that was TMI and thanks for reading."

I'm joining this board across the pond, because I can't seem to find anyone here to talk about or understand what I'm going through. Reading your accounts and discussions have helped tremendously!I had what was supposed to be a ligation and pexy of grade 3-4 hemorrhoids with prolapse. I was told that this was a much tidier recovery than the traditional cut-away.However, after waking up from surgery in a post-op stupor, my surgeon presented me with what looked like a preschooler's crude drawing of the solar system. It took a minute to realize that this galaxy was actually a surgeon's rendering of my poor, retracted, war-torn operating site. It had two large Xs drawn near the outside. She regretted to inform me that the external hemorrhoids were much worse than she previously assessed. On the operating table, an executive decision was made to cut into my muscle to completely remove two hemorrhoids, with ligation and pexy of the remaining six. So I guess I had the ""sampler platter"" of many methods at once!I am currently on day 4, not including operation day. BMs are a bloody screech fest, and my own mother had to lift me up from blacking out on the toilet from pain (this is a good time to tell you that I am a gainfully employed 33 year old registered nurse). My doctor told me to apply lidocaine/nephidipine compound BEFORE having a BM, but I've found that I really only have 5 seconds to react enough to even get to the toilet. They never told me about the potential for near misses! I'm now scared to have visitors.When I finally found the courage and flexibilty to look at the work done, I've found that I am a good bit bruised about 4 centimeters out, as if I took a steel-toed boot to the behind. I'm just really feeling sorry for myself right now!I am also interested in the different medications and remedies in GB and Europe vs the U.S.After reading your entries, there are many medications I've never heard of!

The op seemed to go well. Did feel like I’d had a kick in the pants afterwards but only needed paracetamol and ibuprofen which I took for a week then reduced to zero after 10 days. Avoided using the codeine as I believe they cause constipation and that you do not want!I eat a bowel-friendly diet generally, including daily fruit smoothies. However, I decided to take a low dose of laxative following the op to help smooth the flow. Again I was able to reduce this to zero after 10 days. So the the bad news? It took 48 hours for my first bowel movement after the op and it was excruciating! Avoided pushing but it did feel like I was passing the proverbial grapefruit! All over in 20 minutes with no significant pain later. My advice would be to dose up with more laxative immediately after the op but don’t overdo it. Might have made the first motion less painful.Following bowel movements were much less painful and relatively normal within two weeks. I’d say only one further bowel movement was in any way significantly painful.Now 6 weeks on everything is fine and dandy. I’m very pleased with the outcomes. I hope my experience gives folk thinking of having the HALO procedure some confidence that it does not have to lead to weeks of severe pain.And remember, go with the flow, don’t push:-)"

I first got external haemorrhoids when I was 19 back in 2010. Went through the whole routine of using a balm and suppositories for about a month, needless to say after becoming thrombosed I had to have them removed. Pain was mild and post op wasn't as bad, although using the toilet was a bit hard initially.I seriously believed and hoped that it would be the last time I would ever have to deal with haemorrhoids, however last year March I had developed internal haemorrhoids. They weren't as uncomfortable as the external ones but caused a lot of bleeding, to the point that one day I became anemic from all the blood loss and had have emergency surgery to have them removed. I believe it was 5+ total haemorrhoids removed. Post op pain was severe, I had to receive morphine for two days and ever since I haven't been able to return to my normal active lifestyle fearing it would trigger more haemorrhoids.My hopes of having that be my last ordeal with haemorrhoids was soon dashed in June of this year. I had developed external haemorrhoids and received a balm and suppositories to use. The haemorrhoids did go away but I soon developed an anal fissure and accompanying anal spasm for which I also received treatment. In August what was believed to be an anal fissure hadn't healed and my GP referred me to a surgeon. It turned out that I had internal haemorrhoids which had become infected.The surgery this time around was slightly different. Instead of removing the haemorrhoids, the surgeon used a technique where stitches are used to cut off blood supply to the haemorrhoids and pull them back up into the anal canal. Since it was supposedly a less invasive operation the pain would be less but the first few days post op were really bad.I'm now at almost 5 weeks post op and I'm still in discomfort daily. It's a mild aching/burning sensation and itches at times as well. I did call my surgeon who said it could take up to 3 months to properly heal. My issue is is that I'm starting to develop severe anxiety about this. My haemorrhoids weren't triggered by constipation or any of the usual causes, they just appeared out of nowhere.Right now I sort of feel like I have haemorrhoids. It's hard to tell if I have since I have some scar tissue around my anus from previous operations and I'm really at a loss. Do you guys have any advice? Do I maybe seek out a different doctor for a second opinion or what do I do? I'm a 27-year old guy and I'm seriously becoming depressed about this.

One on the left and one on the right. I've had them since I was a kid, so probably about 15 years. My mom finally convinced me to ""get them cut out"" so I saw the doctor she went to who told me I would likely be able to get back to work in a week or so. Yeah right.17 days post op and I am still in extreme pain after a bowel movement. I have some tissue hanging out of my butt that bleeds from time to time now that isn't a hemorrhoid. The first week of recovery was terrible. Bowel movements weren't too painful. I felt like I was recovering well. But I was going about 3-4x/day.By the second half of the second week, my bowel movements got well formed and solid and became much more painful. The movement itself doesn't hurt too bad, but the after pain intensified tremendously. I have to take an oxy or tramadol and pretty much lay on the couch and breath heavily for an hour before the pain subsides enough for me so even sit at an angle and work from home a bit. The blood the first week wasn't terrible, but has gotten much worse recently. The sharp pain inside from the left incision each time I use the toilet now is terrible. The doctor just says it's my fault that I'm going poo so much or that it's getting harder.I also have this slightly painful bump that formed on the outside of my anus now. I have no idea what it is. It just hurts. It doesn't bleed as far as I know.I'm barely eating anything anymore since I don't want to use the bathroom much.

Perhaps it was because of my fidgeting, wiping, etc. from problem #1. It's taking it's sweet time to go away. I'm 2 weeks into it and while it no longer hurts, it's definitely still a lump on my anus. Hopefully it's shrinking.My questions are:Has anyone experienced a ""wet anus"" after getting hemorrhoid banding? Is it temporary? My doctor seems to think it's from my internal hemorrhoids that have not yet fully shrunken down and more treatment may be required to finally get them where they need to be. Does that seem right?Searching the Internet only makes me more anxious. I begin to think I've done permanent damage to my rectum! But my doctor says this isn't possible since banding doesn't get near the muscular tissue. I certainly didn't think banding could have that result either. Surgery, maybe. But this should be considered a minor procedure, right?I suppose the external hemorrhoid could be exacerbating the leakage issue, but I'm pretty sure I had it before the external showed up, so I don't know if that 100% tracks.Anyone had an experience like this after banding? Did you find out what it was? Also, just curious to hear people's post banding experiences in general. Maybe I'm still healing?Hopefully it'll resolve, either on its own, or with an additional banding. Till then, I'm kind of freaking out. Any advice or word of encouragement are welcome!"

About a day later the symptoms returned with the same discomfort and size as before so I brought some Anusol which helped tremendously which I've been using daily for approx 1 week, after the first two days of using the cream the hemorrhoid shrunk dramatically and pretty much all symptoms have been relieved, however there hadn't been any change for about 3-4 days. So I decided to stop using the cream assuming that it did all it could and the rest was up to my body to heal itself, this doesn't seem to be the case as today the discomfort started to return and after having a BM earlier it seems to have increased in size slightly.I have a doctor's appointment booked for mid November, but I'm not sure what to do in the mean time, is it safe to continue using the cream for more than a week or should I try something else? Also is this common for hemorrhoids to flare up so occasionally? Forgot to mention I'm only 24 years old, not something I expected to deal with at my age!Thanks!"

I was up and about the next day after the op living and doing things pretty much as normal. there is a random throbbing pain that comes and goes but like I said it's more uncomy than painful.I did take my pain relief throughout but only the paracetamol and iburofonI never took the codeine as this causes constipation and didn't want to have any problem s going as the majority of the pain is from going for a number 2I did get worse after a couple days and did have to lay up in bed for a bit but that was more through tiredness due to not really sleeping great and not being comy. now overall so far my experience of this op has been very positive. now it isn't plain sailing and there are some horrible times but nowhere near as bad from what I have read online. if the piles are causing you major problems in your day to day life I would 100% recommend this procedurefollow what other people say about the hot baths after bowl movements and try relax as much as possible. the baths really are a god send when the pain does kick in. also keep on top of pain relief. I know it makes you constipated but I was also given 2 different laxatives to help keep things flowing. so after 5 days im feeling alot better than I did after day 2 and 3(worst days) and very happy I had this done. hopefully the painful poos will get better after a few more days and il be back to myself.don't be scared of what you have read online because I write this as a positive experience and hopefully encourage people to not back out as I almost did from what I have read from other people good luck "

"Piles","hemorrhoidectomy ","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hemorrhoidectomy-681469","Hi everyone I am a 49-year-old female that had grade 3 hemorrhoids. I had the surgery last Wednesday. Just wanted to share my experience with you all. I know you all are very scared from reading other people’s posts, but I’ll be honest it’s not as bad as it sounds.Day one… Arrived at hospital 730 in the morning went down to preop around 9:00. Went into surgery about 945. Was in recovery around 11. The nurse asked if I was in any pain. On a scale of 1 to 10 I was about a four. She gave me a Percocet to feel better. I had some crackers and juice and was discharged from the hospital around 1145. Got home and went straight to bed. Slept a couple of hours woke up and had to urinate. I set up the sits there and sat and sat in hot water. Not too hot. The sitz bath will be your friend for a few days. I changed my dressing took another pain pill ( Oxycodone) did not have much of an appetite. Had about a half cup of oatmeal. Went to sleep again for a few hours. Whatever you do do not skip your pain pill. If you have to take it every six hours take it 5 1/2. You do not want to wait until you have pain. So far I’ve been feeling very nauseous not much pain more uncomfortable. Woke up around 130 in the morning and threw up. Went back to bed. The first day is the hardest part but as long as you take your meds you will be OK.Day two… Woke up feeling better had a whole wheat toast with peanut butter. I thought I had to girl but it was only gas. The dressing did come out and I felt a lot better. Took my pills went back to sleep. Everyone’s in a while I would get a sharp pain down there But nothing I couldn’t handle. I have more of an appetite today which was good. Also make sure you have plenty of fluids. Your diet should be soft foods vegetables fruits oatmeal nothing processed but nothing I couldn’t handle. I have more of an appetite today which was good. Also make sure you have plenty of fluids. Your diet should be soft foods vegetables fruits now nothing processed. Took a stool softener and magnesium before bed. The doctor usually tells you to take a stool softener the first night if that doesn’t make you go then add a laxative. Magnesium as a laxative. Slept through most of the night. Just a little uncomfortable.Day three… Well today’s the day I went. I know it sounds gross but you will be better off to go to the bathroom in the sitz bath. It relaxes your muscles. As soon as I went which wasn’t all that bad. I was more nervous about it than anything. Just make sure you Breathe don’t hold your breath. I went soft which was a good thing. As soon as I was done I used an unscented wipes and jumped in the shower. Let the water cleanse you. Try not to use that much soap. Take a sitz bath whenever you feel uncomfortable. A lot of people had said they sat in the tub with water I personally preferred the sitz bath. No longer than 20 minutes. Also make sure you walk even if you walk back-and-forth you need to move around. Keep the area clean and dry. You will need pads and change them off also make sure you walk even if you walk back-and-forth you need to move around. Keep the area clean and dry. You will need pads and change them often. Today I only took the Oxycodone in the morning because one of the side effects is that they constipate you. Once that wore off I took Advil every four hours and I was OK.Day four...Today I woke up had my breakfast and felt great. The only thing I went to the bathroom five times today. My mistake because I took a stool softener and laxative together and I stocked the Oxsee codi today I woke up had my breakfast and felt great. The only thing I went to the bathroom five times today. My mistake I stopped the oxycodone and should not have taken the stool softener and laxative together. I was OK because every time I went it was soft. No need for pain pill the Advil is helping.Day five… Well today I feel wonderful! The only thing is I’m very itchy down there so that’s a good thing because it means it’s healing. Had my breakfast went to the bathroom once did some laundry housework. My advice to all take the sitz bath whenever you feel you need it even if it’s just for five minutes or 20 minutes it will make you feel better Never skip your pain pills if you need them! Have plenty of fluids. Eat soft foods and walk. I still can’t sit fully but it’s only been a few days!"

I started with bleeding PR a year ago.Had a colonoscopy under sedation.felt everything and I was 1st one to spot a polyp. I would not even bother with sedation next time as yes it's uncomfortable but not painful.I was told that I had internal haems at this. At out-patients was advised haem banding.So 12th December I went in for banding and sigmoidoscopy under general anaesthetic at Bradford Royal Infirmary. I woke up in agony and immediately asked for paracetamol. Should that not have been an indicator that something was possibly not quite right?! I was discharged with no pain relief and only advised to make sure one did not become constipated.So 13th and 14th pain was 2/10. My glutes hurt more and the wind than my backside!Day 3. Fri 15th PM I was in severe pain. Felt like someone was stabbing me on the right side,deep inside my backside constantly. I rang my GP who prescribed movicol for soft bowel movements and tramadol analgesia.Sat 16th I waited 10 hrs (yes really and doing that complaint next!) for NHS 111 to call me back as I felt ill and in pain. The out-of-hours GP didn't examine me PR, nor check my vitals. He gave me clarithromycin antibiotics and naproxen pain relief. So having taken tramadol, naproxen and paracetamol I was still in 20/10 pain.Monday 18th I went to see GP who prescribed me metrodiazinol antibiotics. I couldn't face a PR examination and just kept telling myself it was an infection of banding and would go away.How wrong was I! Sent by GP on Weds 20th December to surgical assessment unit at Bradford Royal. I let my GP exam my rectum and it was pure hell. She could feel a lump and smell and awful smell.So 9pm Weds 20th I had my 2nd general anaesthetic in 8 days. One of my bands was necrotic, infected and thrombosed. They removed the remaining bands.Woke up and even though I'd had a nerve block down there I knew the severe pain had gone.Now it's 2 days post 2nd op and I have some little discomfort but no pain.I tried to ask the surgeon why this had happened to me and he didn't give me any explanation really.If I'd have not gone in on the 20th to have this sorted I may well have developed far more complications.I'm trying to remain positive but I am scared I'm still not right down there. I will never ever have anymore banding nor a haemorrhoidectomy if they offered. The pain from haems I would put up with any day over what I've been through. I cannot get my head round why antibiotics are not given in the UK as surely- anus/rectum- faeces and banding are all a combination for bacteria down there.I would say that this is the worst pain I have ever had.Feeling low and fed up and trying to stay positive as I have a 7 yr old and it's Christmas."

"Piles","2nd internal hemorrhoidectomy - not that bad","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/2nd-internal-hemorrhoidectomy-not-that-bad-680036","It's been 33 hours since my 2nd hemorrhoidectomy of the year, and I'm feeling pretty good. I had the two right internal columns removed and a bit of external tissue. I just pooped. It was completely painless, except for a bit of soreness afterwards. Since having the surgery, the worst the pain has gotten has been about 3/10. My first hemorrhoid experience was similar. I know I'm not out of the woods yet, but I doubt it could get ""that"" much worse from here on.Here are my tips for making it as painless as possible:Start taking Colace 4 days before the surgery and continue up to and throughout the recovery. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables before and after the surgery (though don't overdo it) along with drinking A LOT of water. You want your stool to be as soft as possible before the surgery. The fiber+Colace+water is going to ensure that's the case. Also, eat prunes during the recovery. You don't want to put off your first bowel movement. A hard stool on day 4 is going to be much worse than a soft stool on day 2. Passing a small soft stool really isn't that bad. I seriously couldn't feel any pain, even though I was nervous about the fresh wound.Stay off your ass! The more you move around or sit on your butt, the more pain you will experience. When I was in the hospital, they put my cot in an upright position, but I refused to sit. I laid on my side the entire time. On the ride home, I laid in the seat. When I got home, I immediately went to bed. I wasn't in any pain for any of this. I did it so that the wounds wouldn't be irritated.Maximize your non-opiate pain medication. As soon as I got home from the hospital, I took 1000mg Tylenol and 400mg Ibuprofen. I continued taking these doses as frequently as is recommended right up until now. I set alarms throughout the night in order to wake up and take the medication. My feeling is that the less pain you experience early on in the recovery, the easier the rest of the recovery will be. I also took a lot of the oxycodone they gave me. However, I don't know if that's advisable, since it can cause constipation issues, even if you're hydrating and taking the Colace.Choose the right doctor. This is probably the most important thing and the one you have the least control over. I think I got really lucky in finding a doctor who is super conservative, always trying to do as little cutting as possible.I had three banding procedures done by a different doctor before my surgeries and each one of them was significantly worse than both of the surgeries so far. Thought I'd share since there are so many horror stories out there."

Is there hope...?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/second-flare-up-in-two-months-is-there-hope--679351","Hi folks,I'm a 34 year old male and I've had a small hemorrhoid for a number of years. It never really gave me much problem until two months ago and now I'm feeling rather depressed about it all.I was sat down working for most of the day, got up and felt an uncomfortable sensation. For two weeks afterward, I had a small lump that was extremely uncomfortable, somewhat painful, no blood. I tried baths, ointment and found that it eventually just went away by not fussing with it. Not confirmed by the doc but I assume it's a hemorrhoid given the look and symptoms (see picture).It has now returned a month later, albeit not as bad. No real *pain* as such, more just uncomfortable and irritating. The biggest issue is going to the toilet and feeling tenderness during the wiping process and afterward. Multiple wipes with wet wipes is still an issue as my BMs are quite *messy* and rarely formed like those ideal sausages. Not diarrhea, just more of that softy, fluffy lumps (excuse the description). Plus, I'm always aware of it whenever I'm sat down.I don't really understand what is prompting the flare ups. I generally eat rather well and I'm very regular (twice every morning before and after breakfast) with no constipation. Over the past year, I'm heavier than before by about 15-20 pounds and much less active, spending most of my time at home working. Hardly any exercise and possibly more stressed having started my own business and now having our first kid on the way.The only thing I can think that happened around the time of the initial flare up was deciding to start a four week plank daily exercise plan. Could this have any relation?This second flare up has been going on for a week and a half now. I plan to visit the doctors but want to ask folks that have gone through these issues to find out what they think about my particular situation. And since this is now two flare ups in short succession after years of hardly any issue, is there hope going forward?Thanks so much for your support and advice. "

When I look at it in the mirror, it also looks like a skin tag, though a bit red. Curious of others experiences with this surgeryMy main question is if it is okay for me to use an ointment on top of my wound/suture line. From my banding a few months back, I have samples of analpram HC which is hydrocortisone acetate and pramoxine HCL - I also have two forms of lidocaineI put a small amount of the analpram on a half hour ago and it made the wound feel much better I have no post procedural instructions though regarding creams - only that tucks witch hazel pads are good for extra cleansing Thank you - this board has been the only helpful board !

"Piles","Haemorrhoidectomy (Successful Haemorrhoid Operation)","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/haemorrhoidectomy-successful-haemorrhoid-operation--677722","Hi EveryoneI thought I would share my Haemorrhoidectomy experience and hope it benefits people considering it. BackgroundI had 3 external haemorrhoids for 1 year. They used to come out after bowel movements and then go back in themselves. I used to feel sore after bowel movements but it was manageable. I had Sclerotherapy where there haemorrhoids were injected but this didn't work for me and didn't really make a difference. I knew sooner or later I would need to have the haemorrhoids surgically removed. I was abroad recently on the last week, the haemorrhoids became prolapsed and thrombosed.The pain was excruiciating, the worst type I have ever felt. I use to get muscle spasms down there too which were horrible. Luckily, I have Private Medical Insurance through work and called them as soon as I landed in the UK to book the operation. Haemorrhoidectomy I saw the same surgeon who I saw previously for Sclerotherapy. I was told before hand I would have to stay the night in the hospital. The operation itself went well and lasted 30 - 45 minutes. The surgeon removed 3 large haemorrhoids. This was of course done under general anaesthetic so I didn't feel a thing. This was the first time being in hospital since I was a little kid, so I was feeling a bit nervous in the days coming up to the operation. Once I woke up from the operation, I was in the recovery room where I was slowly waking up. Once the nurses were happy, they took me to my room where I had something to eat. I had a sandwich and some orange juice, I was starving as I had not had anything since 8am on the day. I had a drip on as well, the nurses wanted me to pass urine and told me to call them when I need to go as I had been under general anaesthetic so I might be a bit dizzy. Plus I had the drip on. I managed to pass urine without any issues. Later that night, I was in a lot of pain as I couldn't seem to pass wind, and I kept and having the muscle spasms which were extremely painful. I had to call the nurses a few times at night because of the pain and they gave me a pain killer which helped reduce the pain. I didn't get much sleep that night. In the morning, I had breakfast although I didn't eat much as I didn't feel like eating. The nurse came to check on me and I was released later that morning. I had a lot of questions and was given a lot of advice which I will include below. I was given constipation relief sachets called Movicol, and a antibiotic to prevent infections. Movicol actually tastes nice and is drink-able!Day 1As soon as I got home, I had a quick shower and jumped in bed. It was the first time I had some good sleep since the operation. I already said to myself I was going to go easy on food portions and have a bland diet which was high fibre. I felt sore on day 1 but managed to lie down on my side. I had my medicines as prescribed from the doctor. I had to change my pads in my underwear a few times as well. This was the first time I have ever had to wear a pad so felt a bit weird, but really glad I had it on. Day 2More resting in bed, still feeling sore really. I spent most of the day in bed trying to find the right position to lie down in. Sometimes when I was lying down on my side it hurt. Day 3Same as the day before really, tried to walk a bit around the house a bit more. Still no bowel movement but the portions of food I had been having was quite small. I did want to go soon though to avoid any potential problems e.g constipation. The soreness had gone down and I could lie down with more comfort. During the day, I tried to take my mind of things by watching Tv, going on my laptop, then having a nap. Day 4Day 4 I was feeling a lot better. Soreness had gone down quite a bit and I felt a bit more normal. No bowel movement still and I was thinking I have to go today because I had not been since thursday (the morning of my operation). I continued with my medicine and bland diet. Day 5Today is day 5 when I decided to join this forum. 9am I had my first bowel movement since the operation. It was painful because i had a muscle spasm with every bit that came out! It was difficult as my legs were hurting and I was sweating like crazy! As I had been having stool softeners, i was not constipated and was glad I managed to clear my tummy. I had a shower straight after which felt good. I pointed the head of the shower near the wound which made me feel relief. I was very sore for the next three hours and could barely lie down because of the pain. My surgeon did warn me before hand that bowel movements would be painful. I didn't even feel like watching tv or anything, just wanted to rest but even that was proving difficult. Luckily after a few hours the soreness reduced and I could lie down comfortably. My tips and tricksBelow are just some of the tips I felt were helpful which you may find helpful as well.* After every bowel movement, go for a shower * Try to sleep on your side where possible*Wear a pad in your underwear*Contact your GP if the pain gets very bad so they can offer a strong pain killer.*You will need someone at home with you most of the day. *Have small portions of food which are high in fibre. *Drinks lots of water*Try to go for a bowel movement on the day of your operation so your tummy is emptyMy adviceIf anyone does have haemorrhoids, please do get it checked out by a specialist. I have also read some stories on here where it didn't go well for people. But for me, it has been a success and I can feel this on day 5. Surgery is the last thing I would ever want, especially down there, but you have to think long term. In my opinion, its worth it and best to try and get it done sooner rather then later. There are good and bad stories with everything, and everyone is different. But I would strongly advise anyone considering the operation to get it done. If anyone wants to ask me anything else, please do message me. I hope God cures us all. Remember, With every hardship comes ease...."

I had 2 prolapsed piles removed. I’m a 55 year old woman who suffered from hemmoroids for a very long time. I replied to other discussions but decided to start my own because I’m worried about the swelling, particularly a protrusion coming from my anus that, dare I say, looks and feels like a prolapsed hemmoroid!I noticed it the day after surgery and called my doc who said it’s definitely NOT a hemmoroid. He said when he was finished with surgery, my anus looked perfect 😏 and that this is just swelling that will subside. Well, day 12 it hasn’t subsided at all! In fact, my recovery would be stellar if not for the pain and discomfort of this protrusion. I have a 2 week post op appt with him on Wednesday so will discuss further once he sees what I’m dealing with but wondered if any of the veterans have experienced this kind of thing post op and if so, did it go away? Just to note, I did have 2 protrusions the day after post op. The smaller of the two has completely gone away but the other remains. I had 3 BM’s yesterday and the aftermath was similar albeit worse than what I went through dealing with my hemmooroids all those years so I’m hoping to God I don’t still have them after surgery! 😩This forum is wonderful."

"Piles","hemorrhoidectomy patient experience","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hemorrhoidectomy-patient-experience-535240","I am not one to share like this however I found this board useful/frightening when researching about hemorrhoidectomy surgery. After reading many of the patient experiences I wanted to run and was petrified of going ahead with the surgery. I am now POD 7 and thought I would share my positive experience to help balance out some of the scary stories.I am a young healthy woman in my 30s, approximately 10 years ago I developed a fissure and hemorrhoids requiring a sphincterotomy and hemorrhoid banding. I have since been banded an additional two times with no success. I finally decided to pull the trigger and saw a colorectal surgeon who diagnosed me with stage 3 hemorrhoids. He felt that surgical intervention was necessary and we opted for a stapled hemorrhoidectomy as it has a faster recovery time. I was warned to plan on taking minimum two weeks off of work and perhaps even more as I am a medical professional and work 12 hours days and am on my feet for long hours. Prior to delving into my surgical experience I should divulge two pieces of information. My hemorrhoids caused discomfort which is why I went forward with the procedure so baseline I am used to experiencing rectal discomfort and have been told by many that I have a high pain threshold. Secondly I had a fissure. If you have had one then you understand that it makes bowel movements horrifically, take your breathe away painful. So all pain moving forward is compared to that as the baseline.Alright so here we go....about a week prior to surgery I started taking colace and fiber pills. Starting 3-4 days before surgery I cut out all red meats and dairy and started eating pretty light. I went in for the procedure which took about 45 minutes. When I woke up I was informed that due to the severity of my hemorrhoids I required an excisional hemorrhoidectomy, so I was prepared for a bad recovery. When I woke up i felt uncomfortable and immediately asked for pain meds to get on top of the pain. I was definitely uncomfortable for the first two days and required pain meds around the clock. I set my alarm to wake up overnight so that I wouldnt fall behind. I spent the majority of the first two days lying on the couch and stuck to fruit and soup. I didnt have any bleeding. I did find that it was difficult to initiate urination and at times had to run the faucet to assist. After almost 48 hours without a bowel movement I spoke to my doctor and he suggested milk of magnesia. When I had my first bowel movement it was definitely uncomfortable. THe pain was more of a stinging overstimulation (best way I can describe it). I quickly hopped into the tub which did alleviate some of the pain. Each day I have found that I feel better and better. My appetite has improved. I am still eating lots of fruits and vegetables and staying away from dairy and red meats. I continue with colace and fiber and have been taking milk of magnesia if I dont have a bowel movement for more than 24 hours. I am now a week out and am taking 1-2 percocet a day. While I am still mildly uncomfortable aside from post bowel movements I am fairly comfortable. I have been going on walks the past few days to build back my strength and I am planning to go back to work in another five days.Although every experience is different and I cant promise that yours will be like mine, I wanted to encourage everyone debating the procedure that there are positive experiences. I was definitely prepared for the worst and pleasantly surprised at how well I have done. Please feel free to ask questions and good luck!"

"Piles","Tips for Post Hemorrhoid Surgery ","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/tips-for-post-hemorrhoid-surgery-672433","So I got a hemorrhoid surgery done exactly 7 days ago. I had visited the doctor as I believed I had 2 external hemorrhoids and the doctor informed me that as I was in stage 3 and that I would have to surgically get them removed. After the surgery was done, the surgeon did not give me any tips or advice to deal with the pain and so here I am, after plenty of research and experimenting, to share my 2 cents and hope I can make it easier on others. The pain I have experienced and am still experiencing is something I hope no one ever has to go through, so I hope this helps! 1) Avoid overdosing on painkillers--You are usually prescribed pain killers post surgery and advised to take it every 4 hours. Make sure to take these painkillers before going to the bathroom but do not overdose if not needed. With my surgery, I experienced most of my pain during and post bathroom trips and so I would consume them before going to the bathroom but these painkillers cause constipation which makes bathroom trips 100x more painful, so only take when you feel you're going to experience immense pain. 2) If the painkillers are not helping enough, you can also supplement them with over the counter painkillers like Advil or Tylenol. I used to take both extra strength Tylenol and the prescribed pain killer in the morning and I found this to sort of ease the pain I experienced (or at least numb me by the slightest bit). But again, don't take more painkillers than needed because they can constipate you. 3) Consume both Stool Softeners and a mild Laxative -- Going to the bathroom post surgery is honestly hell, and what I didn't know in the first few days is that it is so important to have a smooth flow of stool to not irritate the stitches (you don't want to push if you don't have to nor do you want to have hard stool). To do this, using both laxatives (to offset the constipation from the painkillers and induce a more easy flow) and stool softeners worked magic for me. I would take them at night before sleeping (as these take about 6-12 hours to kick in) so that most of my washroom trips would happen in the morning and the morning only. This also helped me sort of return to my daily schedule as I could confidently leave my house in the evenings knowing I wouldn't have to go to the washroom suddenly. 4) Consume lots of fiber and water -- Stay away from foods that are known to cause constipation and make sure to consume as much fiber as you can. I'm a 22 year old woman and I've been aiming to consume atleast 35g of fiber a day to ensure a proper bowel movement. Also, because of the excessive amount of medicine and painkillers being consumed, I'm drinking atleast 4 bottles of water which is helping calm my stomach as well as regulate my bowel movement.5) Squirt Bottle -- When going to the bathroom, I find it super useful to use a squirt bottle (or a toilet spray) to spray water towards the infected area so that there's less friction and irritation of the stool against the stitches. 6) Sitz Bath -- As stated many times online, these baths are super useful and I 100% recommend taking as many as you can. I definitely take one after every washroom trip but I also take a few throughout the day as they help a lot with the soreness and overall recovery.7) Polysporin and Vasaline -- Polysporin is a super useful antibiotic ointment to rub onto the stitches and surrounding area to ensure it stays clean but also to help in speeding up recovery. That or Vasaline I found helped keep the area smooth so that as I moved around during the day or were to be sitting, the area would stay moist and clean. I also sometimes applied Vasaline on the stitched area before going to the washroom as I felt it helped reduce friction again and so lessen the pain. 8) Feet Incline -- Keeping a small stool or step under your feet when you're going to the washroom really helps place your body in a more natural position and so makes the bowel flow more smooth without placing too much pressure in that area. 9) Ice Pack -- After every washroom trip and after taking a sitz bath, l spend about 10 minutes icing the area to reduce any swelling and the burning that I would feel. I would be in fetal position and use a new ziplock bag with ice in it as this helped me reach and rest the area best. 10) Pillow -- For the first few days, I would place a pillow between me and any surface I was on to just ensure the area was cushioned. This helped reduce soreness and just helped with overall comfortability. I hope this helps and hang in there xxx Feel free to ask me anything if you'd like. I'm still experiencing insane pain so I'm no expert and I'm trying to look for ways to heal myself too but these are just some things I found useful. "

After 2days there were 3 skin growth on anus I was too scared, as my surgeon was too far from my location I called hospital, they told to take medicines for 10 days and then come for check up, after 10 days I went to surgeon and asked whether it is recurrence of piles. He told no, they are just skin tags, he removed all through same laser technology that day itself by giving local anesthesia. After more 7 days later there was a small skin growth coming from inside anus and I was having hard stools needed to strain during bowel movements, so I decided to went to another surgeon specialist within my location. He inspected my anus with finger, it was paining much, he told the anal hole area has become small due to fibrosis. And the skin may be due to rectal mucosa loosening, so you need a surgery for that which will costs you 50,000 Inr. The skin growth is very small about 0.5 cm but it is folded like black color somewhat. After some days I went to my surgeon again from where I had been operated for piles, he told me nothing to worry its just swelling. It will go. He told by this time you must have become 100% fit. You are suffering from constipation because of lack of exercise. The doctor gave me medicines and told to come for follow up after 1 month. I asked my surgeon whether it is skin tag again, he told no its just swelling if it was skin tag I would have removed it just now through laser. But I am still scared whether it is swelling or rectal prolapse or some else, it goes little inside but after bowel movements it comes more out of anus. I am worried if it is swelling then why it is not going after a month. The doctor had given me shield cream. Are there any other ways to diminish this swelling. Or should I meet another surgeon regarding this. Doing proctoscopy is very difficult because when doctor inspect anus by finger also it pains a lot, rest all time I am painless. Only during and after bowel movement it pains little. My anus hole is getting blocked due to that skin or swelling. Please help. "

"Piles","What to expect after Hemorrhoid surgery ","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/what-to-expect-after-hemorrhoid-surgery-612537","I decided to start this post for a few reasons. The first is to give me something to do while going through this. Second, is maybe get some support from others who have been where I'm at. And third, to let people know who are considering this surgery what to expect.I turned 50 back in March and my wife has been telling me that I needed to go ahead and schedule a colonoscopy. Well like every stubborn male I kept putting it off. So we had been doing a lot of work outside in some hot weather and I ended up getting severe heat dehydration. Spent a few hours in the ER and was told I needed to drink a lot more water than usual. Because of the dehydration, I ended up becoming very constipated and developed some hemorrhoids. The hemorrhoids weren't hurting but they were large. So I went to see a Dr thinking that I could just get some magic cream and poof they would go away. Well, he said those are bad and since I was 50 I needed a colonoscopy also. He set up the surgery for both. Like most people I got on this site and several others and became scared to death. But I went ahead and went through with the surgery on 9/15/17. The colonoscopy went well but here is where the story really begins.......As I was rolled out of recovery and back into my room where my wife was waiting, I was in a good mood. Wasn't in any pain at all. Obviously I was still medicated. They told me that as soon as I was able to urinate I would be able to go home. That was harder said than done. I tried and tried and just couldn't pee. As time went on the medication started to wear off and the pain came with a vengeance. At this point all I wanted to do was go home. The nurse who was checking in on me must have felt sorry for me so she snuck in a shot of Demerol. I even lied and said I was able to go to the bathroom so she started my release paperwork. The Dr. came in and told me to take my pain meds, drink plenty of water, and take warm baths for relief. The Demerol helped and my wife was able to get me home and in bed. The first day really wasn't that bad. Oh don't get me wrong, I was in pain. But the worst was still yet to come. I have a high tolerance for pain also. The second day the pain hit. The best way I can describe the pain is a lot of pressure, stinging sharp pains, and a feeling of being cut down there. (Obviously) I also had trouble urinating which only added to the pain. With the help of pain meds I made it through the second day and night. I woke up on the third day actually feeling pretty good. I got up and soaked in a hot bath and then took a nice long shower. I even felt like getting dressed and trying to feel like my old self. For the best part of the day I was doing great. Still not pain free by any means and still walking like a 90 year old man. Now understand, I haven't had a bowel movement yet. So later that day, about 5 pm I guess, the pain came. It felt like a lot of pressure like I needed to have a bowel movement. But the Dr stressed not to strain so I just waited until I needed to go and then go to the bathroom. Well that time never came. But the pain got worse and worse. I put in a call to the Dr.'s office and they had the on call Dr call me. He told me to double up on the laxatives. So I followed the instructions and did that. Even with all the laxatives still nothing but pain. So on day 4 I called the Dr.'s office and was able to speak with the Dr. who did my surgery. He told me that everything that I was going through was normal and I could go to the pharmacy and get a bottle of Magnesium Citrate and try that. My wife ran to the pharmacy and got a bottle. The pharmacists told her to tell me to drink the entire bottle and I should have a bowel movement between 30 minutes to 6 hours after drinking the bottle. Well almost three hours later Hell came. I just made it to toilet before the bottom fell out. Even though it was soft, mostly diarrhea, the pain was horrible. The burning was way too much to handle so I jumped directly into the shower and started spraying myself off with the shower head. Then I just laid in a hot tub of water until the pain let up. I have continued to take all of the medications the Dr prescribed. As the evening of day 4 came around, I was totally spent dealing with all of the pain. My wife was trying to get me to go to the ER but I knew that all they would do is give me pain med and tell me to follow up with my Dr and then give me a nice bill. I made it through night 4 and on the morning of day 5 my wife called my Dr.'s office and made me an appointment for 2 pm. (That is today by the way). The Dr came in and looked at the area and said everything was looking like it is supposed to only 5 days after surgery. He could see that I was in a lot of pain and reassured me that this would all pass. He told me that some people can't take the pain and have to be admitted into the hospital. He said that things should start feeling better in a few days. He changed my pain medicine from Lortab to Percocet and added Neurontin to also help with the pain. So that's where I'm at right now. Day 5 and still hurting. Some of you that have had this surgery may have been doing much better by day 5 and some worse. I think we are all different and react differently to pain. I do know this is not a surgery to just jump into without getting some facts first. It's going to hurt. That's the one truth that I think all who have experienced it will agree on. I would love to hear other's post op stories. I know that I still have a ways to go before I am pain free. As I am able, I will update everyone with how my recovery is going.Take care,Randy "

I looked around some previous threads (and maybe I'm missing a search option that only searches this forum).Summary of symptoms: - Combined internal/external hemorrhoid - Internal comes out during BM (pushed back in) - BM are pretty narrow and usually formed and harder (working on fiber but not enough perhaps). I assume the low volume and narrow poops are due to the internal making the passage way more narrow? - I get a thrombosis every couple of years - I asked doc for surgery but backed out - After my last two soccer games, the external gets really irritated (feels like a mild thrombosis where the pile doesn't get fully filled b/c it has enough skin... its basically a skin tag now from a previous thrombosis) - Every few months I have no bleeding internally - When bleeding starts, it stays irritated for a few months. - If there is bleeding, it's only during BM and sometimes has clots (not sure if they are coming out from the internal one or if it's from sitting on the toilet too long)Now, if I could reduce the size of this thing, naturally, I'd be super happy. I'd like to be able to play soccer or run without having a kind of a flare up. I don't know... maybe at this point the external skin tag bit (being in the middle back) is just a larger size forever and will always be annoying unless I get it cut out. It wasn't always like this. I could play soccer without feeling it after. I can even feel it while sitting.Also, if your natural remedy ideas are a form of application, how do I get whatever oil/cream in contact with the internal bits?As for diet, I have been adding fiber powder (3g per) to water about 2-3 times a day and I've been eating Fiber One bars and apples. I would guess I'm in the 15g range for daily fiber intake. I know men need more. But, if I eat too much I get a stomach ache. They get too loose, and since I'm hairy and the placement of the external, it's super annoying for hygiene. Thanks!"

She took me over to one of the recovery beds and said that they would perform an ultrasound on my bladder to see how full it was. It was half full, so urinating normally should have been easy. The nurse said that the bladder often ""falls asleep"" from the local anesthesia. She asked the doctor if she should put in a catheter and he said he wanted her to,as they would not allow me to drink anything or discharge me until I could urinate. I went to the bathroom to try urinating on my own in a last minute effort to avoid a catheterization but to no avail. So I told her I was ready and one of the LVNs dabbed my penis with iodine and inserted to catheter as i screamed a little bit from the horror of it, not to mention the discomfort and burning sensation as he drained my urine. I confess, however, this being my first catheter ever, It hurt less than I anticipated. Once I was drained, the catheter was removed and the nurses said congratulations and offered me drinks and more snacks. My post-operative meds, Percocet and Valium, were brought to me as I prepared to leave. My friend picked me up from the hospital and when I got home I immediately took 2 percocet, 1 valium, 3 bisacodyl, and 3 Tablespoons of Mineral Oil. I fell asleep for a while and got up a few times to pee. It wasn't until the next day that I started to feel the urge to have a bowel movement. I had the sensation that I needed to go badly but only gas and anal leakage was coming out. By the third day I was feeling very bloated and uncomfortable, having to run to the toilet frequently but still only having gas and fecal leakage. I passed the gel foam pack while having gas. However I was getting nervous about having no bowel movement for 3 days and feeling so bloated, so I decided to go to the Emergency Room as a precaution to be given magnesium citrate and an enema to finally relieve myself. After a few attempt to flush my rectum with the enema liquid, I squatted and eveything came out. I felt relief like you can't believe. I went home and took a shower. All the while, I was taking my pain percocets and managing the pain to a level of only mild discomfort. After a few more days of being on percocet and taking laxatives to combat the constipation it would otherwise cause, I switched to ibuprofen, four of them at a time as needed. Yesterday, I had a bowel movement and saw one of the sutures in the toilet, which apparently is normal. My pain at this point is not totally gone but minimal. It feels like my hemorrhoids are gone but I won't be sure for a few more weeks I think. It still hurts when I laugh or cough. My surgeon said that I would be completely healed in two months. So far, I'm very happy that I've had this surgery after being irritated by my hemorrhoids for years. I wish I had known about THD years ago! The temporary pain and discomfort has been well worth it so far. Tell me about your experience or ask me any questions you might have. "
"Piles","Sentinel Pile or Hemorrhoid? ","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/sentinel-pile-or-hemorrhoid--668797","I'm a 29 year old female, with a past history of IBS. I'm looking for some opinions because I'm pretty freaked out after leaving my GI doctor's office. For the past 5 years, I've had a squishy lump that's located about 6 o'clock position, just inside my anus. It will occasionally pop out during a bowel movement, and then recede back in after a few minutes. I did some research and figured out that this is likely a sentinel pile. I recently had a 3 week period where I constantly felt like I needed to have a bowel movement, but didn't. So, I went to a gastroenterologist, who did a digital rectal exam and told me she felt the ""squishy lump"" which she thinks is a hemorrhoid, and referred me to a colorectal surgeon for an anoscopy.Honestly, I'm freaking out! I know that lump has been there for some time, but the fact that she thinks I need to see a surgeon really scares me for some reason. I'm scared it could be anal cancer, even though I know it's rare. I can't get in to even see the surgeon for almost 2 months. Had anyone else had a DRE and had similar findings with a sentinel pile or hemorrhoid?? "
"Piles","Emergency hemorrhoidectomy recovery 5 days after childbirth","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/emergency-hemorrhoidectomy-recovery-5-days-after-childbirth-619307","Hi guys. This site has been so useful to me in my post op recovery.. I wanted to share my story in hopes of helping someone else. I'm a 30 year old female.. in relatively good health. I've had some pretty gnarly internal hemorrhoids from the age of 22 that always prolapsed after every bm, but they've always been manageable and have only given me real grief about ten times. I gave birth to a child last Tuesday (first time) and while pushing.. it appears my internal hemmies exploded to the size of a full orange ( no exaggeration ). My OB kept insisting the swelling would go down.. but by day 4 of not being able to sit stand or walk.. one of the nurses at the hospital insisted I get checked out at the ER. I went just to see if maybe they could shrink it with some lidocaine injections as I also had a second degree episiotomy tear from child labor and was still in a lot of pain and on painkillers from that.Instead.. the on call colorectal surgeon decided to come in from home because he said my hemorrhoids had turned necrotic and would turn into a severe infection sooner than later.. I went into emergency surgery not even 6 hours later at 1am on 10/29. At this point I had not had a bowel movement for 5 days due to the Percocet I was on for my episiotomy.. I was already severely impacted fecally but my surgeon told me he was able to remove what he could as well as removing all the necrotic tissue. To my understanding he removed over 5 large hemorrhoids all internal that had prolapsed and died.Right after surgery.. I was given dilaudin as soon as the numbing agent starting wearing off.. the pain was excruciating... I begged the nurse to give me an additional dose of anything.. eventually she gave in and gave me a dose of oxycodone as well. While the pain didn't completely go away.. it did make me drowsy enough to get a couple hours of sleep.. only to wake up to excruciating pain again. I was literally counting down the seconds for the next dosage except this dose of dilaudin and ocycodine didn't alleviate anything and for the next 6 hours I was left to be in excruciating pain because they could not give me any other options in fear of overdose. After 6 hours.. they gave me a combination of Tylenol and tramadol and actually this helped SO MUCH MORE than the strong dilaudin. After getting sent home.. I realized that the combination of Tylenol and ibuprofen actually help a lot more than the oxycodone they prescribed me.. but in an effort to not feel anymore pain I continued to take Tylenol, ibuprofen, oxycodone and Valium(for the anal muscle spasms). THIS IS A BAD IDEA especially when you already have not had a bowel movement in over 5 days as oxycodone and Valium are both constipating narcotics.Day 1. Taking all the meds I can take.. which are currently 4000g of Tylenol, 2400g of ibuprofen, 40g of oxycodone and 20g of Valium per day as well as a daily dose of miralax. Unable to do anything but without the meds pain level was an 11 out of 10.. with the meds I would say pain level was a 7. While not great, it's much better than an 11 and expected for day 1 Post op. Spent most of the day crying.. but even that hurt.. so tried to just lay there and sleep as much as I could. Day 2Still taking all meds.. pain is slightly better.. maybe a 6.8 instead of a 7.. but still an improvement. No bowel movement yet, but again not able to do much. If you think you're gonna read or do any hobbies.. forget it.. just try to get some sleep and heal your body. Day 3Feeling much better except for the uncomfortableness of not having had a bowel movement. Decided to cut out oxycodone and so now I'm only taking the other three plus miralax. My husband also went out and got recticare which I highly recommend. It's a lidocaine cream which you put on after baths, showers, or after bowel movements. It kind of numbs the area.. and makes you feel so much better. Pain level is 5 today even without the painkillers.. only real pain is coming from the stuck bowel movement that won't come out but is sitting in my rectum.Day 4Only took one dose of Valium and two doses of ibuprofen(1200g) and Tylenol (2000g). Pain level 4.5. By day 4 I was completely desperate.. I had been taking colace since childbirth, senna-s, and after my hemorrhoidectomy I was taking miralax. NOTHING WORKED. As someone who usually has a bowel movement everyday.. not having one for ten days is terrifying. I was determined to have one today. I got some milk of magnesia and took two doses of that throughout the day on top of the miralax. The problem with all these stool softeners/laxatives is they work from the top down. So while I could feel the rumblings in my stomach.. there was no action taking place.. I decided to take action into my own hands.. literally. This next section is going to be pretty gross.. but I'm sharing it for those who are truly desperate for relief. So please skip over if you don't want to read.. I finally figured out that using my squatty potty was going to be the only way I would have a bowel movement. Previously I was not using this because everytime I squatted it felt like my stitches and anus were gonna drop out of my body. It won't. Make sure to squat. It won't help with the pain but it will help your movement come. The first bowel movement took an hour with only a quarter sized piece. Even with such a small amount.. I felt extreme success. I got into the groove of what I needed to do.. I would rock back and forth on the seat and then the urge came I would lean all the way back and push. For anyone that's been in child labor.. the doctor doesn't let you push until your uterus contracts.. this is the same concept. Let your body involuntarily strain first and you only push during these times. Straining at any old time will only resurface new hemorrhoids. The second bowel movement started not even 30 min later due to my newfound success. However, this one was about 8 inches of 2.5 inch wide feces that would NOT be coming out on its own. It took me 3 hours, a glove and lots of walking back and forth and pushing. I honestly felt like I was in labor again except worst because I had no epidural this time. I literally had to push and then remove whatever little came out with my gloves. Gross I know but I honestly believe that this piece would never have came out on its own due to how sticky and impacted it was. After 3 hours my butt was pretty swollen so I decided to call it a day. Too bad all the laxatives I had taken decided they wanted to work now. For the next two hours, I was running back and forth.. completely sore now.. having explosive diarrhea. Normally I would complain but at least my insides were finally clearing out. I'm not gonna lie though.. after this.. pain level shot back up to an 8. I don't know if this was also because of all my diarrhea.. but I immediately had to take a full dosage of Tylenol, ibuprofen and Valium again to ease the pain. I purposely left out oxycodone because I'm not trying to give birth to a poop again. Day 5While I just woke up.. I do feel much better.. pain level is back to 4 with Tylenol and ibuprofen. I guess my point is.. that now while I'm completely sore from all the bowel movements.. it is only day 5 and I am feeling much much better. I have stopped oxycodone since day 3.. I only take Valium sparingly (once a day max) if I'm having a ton of spasms.. and I've lowered my Tylenol dosage from 4000 grams a day to 2000geams a day and my ibuprofen from 2400g to 1800 g a day. It does get better everyday and already I'm feeling hopeful. I can walk much better not without completely waddling.. and plan on going up and down the stairs at least once today. I am experiencing anal leakage.. but I have been religiously wearing pads and hopefully that will go away. Please feel free to ask any questions and I'll answer to my best ability. I hope this gives hope to people and I'll continue to update as I go. "
"Piles","To surgery or not to surgery","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/to-surgery-or-not-to-surgery-668446","Hi,I have had hemorrhoids for years and I'm sure you all now how annoying they are. I'm 38, normal weight, if that matters. I had my first thrombosis a few years ago. I had no idea what it was so just let it ride. It was what seems to be a connected internal and external hemorrhoid. Sorry for the detail, but clots broke out from inside and out.Fast forward a couple years, I got another thrombosis on the same spot, I think. The ER took out the clot but didn't do a good job. It clotted again and another doctor told me to try suppositories. That made it worse. I ended up having a thrombosis and a prolapse that wouldn't go back in on it's own. I had surgery (not hemorrhoidectomy) where he massaged the area back in and took care of the thrombosis. It was a pain and I believe I had bleeding for a week or two. Supposedly, this surgery was nothing compared to the full hemorrhoidectomy. Over the next year or so until now, off and on, the internal one bleeds after bowel movements, and comes out a bit where I gently push it back in. A lot of times clots will come out, too.A couple weeks ago, I had a thrombosis (new area) and a proctologist fixed it. The thrombosis occurred after a soccer game. I was fine within days. He told me to make an appointment to have the internal one banded.A week later I was back in the doctor after my next soccer game. I had taken 2 weeks off from soccer after my latest thrombosis. The doctor saw no thrombosis and sent me on my way. After the following weeks soccer game, I was certain I had a thrombosis again! The doctor had me cancel the banding and set up for a hemorrhoidectomy.Now I'm terrified. I've read horror story after horror story. Right now, I'm at the end of a case of incredible itching and some discomfort but do I really need surgery? I feel like the pain would suck but I could get through that. My fear is the longevity of the post op issues (pain, leaking, bleeding, pooping myself). There are some hygiene issues with the external one. Like I think I said, the internal and external are connected (even says the doctor after exam). He also said the external is more of a skin tag. But, it gets in the way of wiping. I had been using creams for 2 years out of fear that I'd have a thrombosis. I've stopped using creams (only a week or two). I have some discomfort sitting. I can sometimes feel that I'm sitting on the skin tag. But is that worth getting surgery? If the skin tag are gets irritated that bad after playing soccer (and I don't intend on quitting), do I do surgery? Should I just get the banding done and see if he has non surgical options for the skin tag?I'm due to have the hemorrhoidectomy mid day on Tuesday. I feel like I always make the wrong decision on if I should or shouldn't have something done. Had I just had it done a couple years ago, the chance is still there I still had a new thrombosis a few weeks ago, right? Why am I getting surgery? I am terrified of getting the surgery done and terrified of not getting it done. Please help.Thank!"

It used to hurt so much when I was constipated.Moreover, every time I have a bowel movement and I sit more than few minutes the hemorrhoid(if it is one) gets so swollen it's like a piece of meat stuck to the anus so I have to have a bowel movement and immediately get up, it is also so sensitive when I have one.It's draining me psychologically that I cannot receive help. I bought some hemorrhoid cream back when I wouldn't eat much fiber and bowel movements were so painful but nowadays it is not needed as the swelling goes back no normal after I get up. However, it's still hanging outside of my anus.I remember being 16 and feeling something not right on my butt, but never had any issues with it until recently (a year or so). I've never been told to eat a high fiber diet, not to strain and so on so I had to find this out by myself the hard way.I would kindly ask for your help and appreciate your help and opinions so much.I cannot really tell if it's an internal or an external one (I see a skin tag on the hemorrhoid if I'm not wrong) nor can tell the grade of it. Oh, I think I have specified, it's always hanging on my anus.I have some pictures of my butt pushing as much as I could to be able to see every bit of it.

Then the question underneath.I've been having bad hemorrhoids for the past year and a half or so. They;ve been getting worse in the past few months - they don't go back in right away; there's more blood on the paper/dripping in the bowl; and the prolapsing one seems a bit larger.I went to a gastroenterologist yesterday hoping to get rubber band ligation done. He said he doesnt do it at his office, but I'd need to get it done with a colonoscopy at a hospital with which his practice is associated. I'm waiting to get a call back about scheduling, but he told me it could take 2-3 weeks.I've tried sitz baths, witch hazel, and OTC products, and I really want to just get this treated asap and to just get it over with. But shopping around for specialists isn't exactly cheap; not to mention the cost of any procedure. So I want to try anything else I can do before scheduling anything.[u]Anyway, for the question:[/u]Has anyone used those frozen ""suppository"" type of products like Anuice? It's basically a small plastic suppository shaped thing which you freeze, and they claim that by using it for a few minutes a few times a day, you can shrink hemorrhoids. Reviews on Amazon seem good, but I havent seen anyone mention what grade of hemorrhoids they used it for. I also havent seen any reviews for it on other forums or reddit. Is it possible to shrink hemorrhoids this way if they are grade 2 or 3? Or is this just some snake oil?I'd appreciate any input.Thanks so much! "
"Piles","Postitive Hemorhhoidectomy Story","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/postitive-hemorhhoidectomy-story-666262","Hi everyone. I am a 30 year old teacher and mom of two toddlers and have been dealing with hems since I gave birth to my oldest. I finally went to see a colorectal specialist who examined me and recommended surgery for my two grade 3 external hemorrhoids. After I agreed I started googling...and oh boy that did not help my situation. I am writing this down to give any of you who are researching surgery, a story that isn't terrible. After long talks with hubby I realized that most people who take the time to come to an online forum are having issues and that it may seem skewed in favor of bad outcomes. So here is my long story. I hope this helps someone- it was very therapeutic for me to write down.(1) Thursday June 28th- Surgery day! I have been taking 1 cup of miralax each night at the advice of my surgeon and eating a high fiber diet. I have been having one easy bm each morning and have one this morning before I head to the surgery center with hubs at 7:00. I was very scared but they took great care of me in prep. When I came out of anesthesia I was informed that I stopped breathing on the table and they had to intubate me so now I have a sore thorax in addition to a sore bum When I came to it was only like 9:30 and I had a huge pain in my rear, They injected something more into my IV and I was discharged very quickly. Hubs took me home and we got me into bed and got the first percocet into me.I was doing one pill every 4 hours to manage pain and this day passed in a bit of a haze from the effects of being put out.(2) Friday June 29th- Today was the day we realized that I was having a major reaction to percocet. I couldn't stand up without starting to black out, was itching like crazy, and vomited twice (it hurt my stitches sooo badly!). After talking to the amazing nurse at my surgeons office, we decided to half the percocet and supplement with advil. In retrospect this was probably the worst day/night. That night I felt like I had to have a bm and was up and down all night. I finally sat on the toilet and let out mostly watery poop. I was up in the sitz bath and lightly dozing on the couch most of the night.(3) Saturday June 30th- Another bad day. Today we decided that percocet wasn't going to work, even at half a dose. I was still so nauseous from it. Somehow hubby got it into his head that I should try medical marijuana (side note- I have never smoked weed in my life!). We have a friend who has a card and brought over a vape pen with oil in it but I don't think I was doing it right. My lovely little sister heard about it through the grape vine and offered me some 'edibles'. I tried those too and didn't feel any affects. So then mommy that I am, decided to alternate tylenol and ibuprofen every 4 hours the way that you do with a sick kid. It wasn't perfect, but with the lidocaine numbing cream I made it work.(4) Sunday July 1st- this was an ok day, I pooped liquid a few times and it was a very burn-ey feeling. I laid on my side out back in a hammock for 20 mins and that did a lot to perk me up. When taking one of my doses of advil, I choked on the pills, gagged, and threw up so that hurt a lot! This was another night where I didn't sleep well, I was up a lot on the couch.(5) Monday July 2- I was done dozing for good around 5 when my body decided that I needed to bm. I probably went 3-4 times that morning and 7-8 times total that day. That was the day I decided to stop taking miralax. I wasn't on constipation inducing opioids anymore, and I was drinking 90 oz of water and eating right so I think the miralax was just too much for my system. I am still on around the clock OTC pain meds and feeling ok. Also, my mom came over this day and somehow we got on the topic of what my butt looked like (she had this op done 20 years ago). She got me bent over on my bed and took a picture for me so I could see myself. OMG I am soo bruised! I am black and blue all the way up my butt crack. I can see small sutures where the two hems were and a large swollen area between them that looks like a new hem. but have been assured it is just normal swelling. (6) Tuesday July 3rd- Today I was up at 6 and had a bm, another around 8. I was able to get it over with and not take a sit bath although I did put some frozen peas back there. I haven't needed round the clock tylenol either. I still can't sit right on my butt but I can lay on my back for 30 mins or so which is a nice break from being on my side. I am up walking around and not waddling so much like a penguin. What I want most now is for the swelling to go down, and for my GI tract to regulate itself. I was having a soft but formed morning bm every day for over a month and I just want to get back to that. I am a teacher, and was committed to summer school. I was planning to go back to work the 9th but I still don't know if that will work out. I need to be able to poop before work (and only then) and sit for at least an hour at a time. I have my follow up appt thursday and I am hoping I get good news from my dr. In summary, yes the pain was bad and sucked, but I got through this and every day is a tiny bit better than the one before it. It's so hard to see the progress when you have to live through it every day, but you will get through this just like I am! "

Have 2 bowel movements most of days, sometimes 3. Stools are normal formed most of time, loose from time to time. Never watery dhiarrea. - It all started with some anal ich 5 years ago or so. I still have some itch around my anus from time to time. - Last year I noticed a few drops of fresh blood in the toiled 2 times. A few times there was some fresh blood on stool- For the last one year I have some mucus with every bowel movement. Whie or yellow mucus attached to the first piece of stool which comes out. Sometimes there is some clear mucus with the last piece of stool. Its tea spoon amount or less.- Delayed pain after bowel movements. Last year pain was more intesive than recently. It starts usually 30 minutes after a bm and lasts for next few hours. Discomfort and pain in anus. Last year I had that pain for 6 months or so. After a few months without it, pain after bm started this year again, but its not that intesive. Sometimes pain is there, but on some days I'm free of it.I don't have any belly pains. Maybe some discomfort on the left side of belly button. Something like gas caused pain/discomfort. It comes and goes from time to time, usually do not last long.- Recently I noticed some blood mixed with mucus and that's what worry me the most. There are very tiny traces of blood in mucus which is attached to stool. To be honest I wouldn't notice it If I didn't examined it with with a torch. Not sure if hemorrhoids can cause blood in mucus?- Sometimes I have electric shock like pain in my anus. It lasts only for a second. Most of time it affect anus only but sometimes it feels like electric shock which connect my belly button and anus. This is happening maybe once a month or so.So, to sum it up... I have mucus with every bowel movement, anal pain which lasts a few hours after bowel movements, small amounts of blood in mucus from time to time.I'm really worried this could be something more serious than hemorrhoids or a fissure. How all this sounds to you? Could it be a beginning of Chron or Collitis, some kind of cancer?"

The location is similar to where I've had mild discomfort several times in the past and I suspect it could be related to the bleeding. Some days the lump is painless while on others it is not - however I've noticed that when I bleed it hurts less. Could this lump be a vain filled with the blood that hasn't 'popped' when I poop? I've also been trying to figure out what causes the lump to appear. I don't strain, I don't lift heavy items, I drink plenty of liquids and I have a good, fibre filled diet. The only thing I can think of is that i sit for long periods at work and have a habit of resting mainly on my left butt cheek. Could I be trapping blood flow and causing this lump to fill up?I'm honestly at a loss as to what to do about the issue. I still waiting to be seen by a consultant following an 8 week wait so far and get literally zero help, advice or commission from my gp. I feel trapped and low because of this stupid bleeding. It's 3 years since this all started and I sick to death of it. Any advice would be much appreciated. "

At the moment, my main concern is when I have a bowel movement, it takes me a few goes to actually push because it feels like I'm tearing myself open. It's not extremely painful like when I first noticed the haemorrhoids but it does hurt a little and is uncomfortable.I've been applying ointment I got at the chemist, but admittedly not 3 times a day or after each BM as it states. I also have not been taking Coloxyl to soften the stools as advised. So this is probably my fault they're not going away. After today's BM, I noticed the toilet was bloody. It was bright red and I know blood in water can go a long way. There was also bright red blood on the toilet paper, after 1 wipe it's gone.Has anyone else experienced bleeding with their haemorrhoids? Mine are external but could this also mean I have internal ones too?Please note that I am currently moving house, so have been doing a lot of heavy lifting which probably isn't helping my case and because I'm between homes, I haven't had the best diet (more fast-food than I should... limited veggies)"

","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/are-these-typical-symptoms-of-haemerrhoids--665873","So I've had a big scare recently - I've always had what I suspected to be IBS - given me a range of constipation and diarrhea and makes me go to the toilet a lot.I noticed blood in my stools over the last month, slowly increasing until it was happening with every bowel movement. The doctors thought it was IBD or crohn's and have blood tested me but the results gave no indication of that. However, when sitting the other day, i felt very uncomfortable and took a picture of my bum. When i relaxed it, i could see 2 purple lumps at the top of the opening - im guessing these are haemorrhoids. I would find that the blood in the stool would be little specks/streaks of red that would look much brighter when wiped against tissue. Because of my potential IBS - my bowel movements start hard then get much looser - the bleeding normally always comes towards the end of a BM - is this typical of haemorrhoids?this is the bit thats scaring me - at the end of my bowel movements, i'll occasionally do a fart which will produce a lot more blood in a little bloody pooey mucusy sort of discharge - are haemerroids capable of causing this? Now I don't strain loads and im not normally constipated but I do have lots of loose stools and do spend a lot of time on the toilet which I know can also cause them. "

"Piles","Hemorrhoidectomy - Life And Death","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hemorrhoidectomy-life-and-death-623484","Please do not take the title lightly... Let me give you some background. I am a 24 year old male who has been dealing with hemorrhoids for the past two and a half years. I have been trying to treat the symptoms with a well respected doctor for the past year with rubber band ligations. He has been in the field for decades, heads the colon and rectal department at one of the biggest hospitals in our state, and literally teaches people how to perform a variety of procedures. Needless to say, I knew I was in good hands. Although these treatments have helped a little, they have overall failed. After many ineffective sessions, my doctor and I began the talk about surgery. He tells me I have two internal hemorrhoids (Grade III). The amount of turmoil this has caused in my life is absolutely devastating. The hemorrhoids themselves do not physically hurt, but they cause irritation (itchiness, hard to clean, etc.). It has completely sidelined my life for the past two years. Who could think something so tabboo can affect so many aspects of my life. Physically, I do not lift weights for a fear of making my hemorrhoids worse or developing new ones. I was in excellent shape and my confidence was at an all time high when I was consistent in the gym. Working out has helped me mentally tremendously. I have always had issues with anxiety and depression. The fact that it is now stripped of me because of this issue just makes me so depressed.This carries into so many aspects of my life. Work wise, I am unable to perform to my full ability because I am so stressed out from my hemorrhoids and not being able to have a mental release from working out. My boss has even had to sit me down and had a serious talk about my performance. I literally broke down into tears and started sobbing. I admitted to him it was my hemorrhoids and my only option was extremely painful surgery. I've never felt so low.Mentally, I am at the absolute worse position in my entire life. The though of surgery terrifies me. I literally think about it all the time and it consumes my life. I know it is my only option and I'm trying to build up courage to do it. I've heard all of the horrible things about the recovery. The thought of this has literally kept me up. I rarely get even 5 hours of sleep per night. A few months back, I was up for 5 days straight without any sleep in a manic state. I've never felt so terrible...But it kept getting worse... Depression has led me to abusing alcohol more than I usually do. I drink to forget. It isn't healthy and I hit my lowest point where I ended up curled in the fetal position sobbing in the shower... The day after I called my mom and had an emotional breakdown...The thought of suicide has always passed my mind but it was more of a secondary thought. Sort of something that I think about but never really took seriously. But as time goes on, the thought has become more of a reality.I realized this this is daunting and I have decided I want to fight. I have been slowly been building up courage to schedule a hemorrhoidectomy. To say I'm beyond terrified is an understatement. I have read many stories about the recovery and they are nothing short of horrible. Black out pain. Vomiting from pain. Crying yourself to sleep. Worse than childbirth... The list goes on. I have never been in any serious pain in my entire life. I do not know how to prepare for this. But at this point, I have no choice... Either I get this surgery and fight to get my life back... or I don't and just keep on spiraling into a deeper depression and then do something stupid...The reason I am posting this is to ask for support. I need it more than ever in my life. I am at the absolute lowest point I've ever been at and am desperately searching for support. Also, those who have gone through with this surgery, could you please offer me some advice, input, or tips that could at least make this entire process for me easier?I plan on doing an update to this post about how I am doing post-surgery. Thank you sincerely for reading this lengthy post... It's time for me to fight to get my life back! - Maxwell"

Every once in awhile it would flare up, I would get it lanced and it would go away. Off and on for 7 years. Finally it came to a point where I was done dealing with it and wanted it fixed permanently. I went to a surgeon and found out I had grade 3 internal hemorrhoids as well as external hemorrhoids. I was told about the pain after surgery but thought that since I had dealt with this for 7 years I would be able to tolerate the pain so I proceeded with surgery. I was encouraged to take a stool softener a few days prior to surgery and I did an enema cleanse the day of surgery so I felt like I was very prepared. Surgery went as expected and I was very comfortable when I went home and didn't need to start my pain pills until the next day. The next day is when the pain would start and become horrendous. I thought I was prepared for this pain but there was nothing that could prepare you for this. I laid around for 4 days straight hardly getting off of the couch, drinking plenty of fluids, taking a stool softener, drinking Miralax, eating a balanced diet, urinating without any problems, takinf pain pills every 4 hours around the clock and still uncomfortable. I still had not had a bowel movement on post op day 4. I went to the doctor on post op day 4 for some extensive burning that I felt on one of my external repairs. The surgeon said it looked like I was rejecting one of the stitches and it was an open area that I just needed to try to keep dry and clean. That's impossible! Another thing that they don't prepare you for is the constant leakage/drainage from the surgical site. I was told to take minimal sitz baths due to the fact that he did not want the water to break down my stitches faster than expected. A sitz bath was the only thing that felt good at this point so I did it. Day 4 after I saw the surgeon I went home and drink some mineral oil at his request to get my bowels moving. About 6 hours after taking the mineral oil my bowels started to move. This was the worst pain I have ever experienced in my entire life. I was holding on to the walls repositioning in pain, I was sweating, I had goosebumps, I was screaming and deep breathing while trying not to strain to get this bowel movement out. When it finally decided to come out it was very soft which was a blessing but that did not seem to make it any less painful. I was in pain for about 2 hours after that and I did have a little bit of blood during that bowel movement. I had dreaded that bowel movement since the day of surgery but was glad to have it out of the way. I thought I would be prepared for the discomfort since I had dealt with this for 7 years but no one prepared me for the burning that I would feel after surgery. I think that's probably due to the constant wetness from the discharge from the incision site. The doctor said it did not look infected and this was all normal. Day 5 post-op and I am still taking pain pills occasionally throughout the day. I tried to go to Tylenol and ibuprofen but that was not controlling the pain enough. I know that these pain pills will make the constipation worse but I also know that I need to be able to function and keep the pain under control. I have had 3 C-sections in the past, one of which included an open wound that needed to be packed and with that procedure I didn't even take as many pain pills as I have had with this hemorrhoid surgery. With that being said, I would rather have 3 more C-sections than go through this ever again. I am hoping with time that this pain will get better the drainage will go away and I won't have to deal with this ever again. Until then I am wondering how much longer I can deal with this. I had my surgery last Monday and was scheduled off of work last week and am supposed to return on Wednesday. Today is Sunday and I am wondering how I am going to be able to go back on Wednesday. I hope this is helpful and I don't mean to scare anyone away from having the surgery but want you all to be aware that this is not something to take lightly.

I am not where I thought I would be at this point in my recovery. I have pain with every BM, it is just a matter of how intense and how long it will last afterwards. Some days is it not to bad and is a level 1 or 2 that last for 4-5 hours and some days it is a level 10 that last for 10 hours. In the last 5 days I have had 3 level 10 days. The average over all 13 weeks is 2-3 of the really bad days per week. I take a stool softener every day, watch what I eat and drink 6-8 bottles of water a day. So to say I am frustrated is an understatement.My question is this, do I go back to the surgeon that did the surgery and told me I would be good in 3 weeks? Or do I find another surgeon and get a second opinion on my situation. I scared to do either because I know how much an examination is going to hurt.Any advice would be appreciated."

"Piles","Haemorrhoids and Intermittent Bleeding","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/haemorrhoids-and-intermittent-bleeding-651269","I’ve literally had this issue since I was 17 and I’m now 49. I’ve had 2 colonoscopies because of this nonsense (most recent 2012). I’m a very small person so it’s not due to me being overweight, it’s just something in my family and well, it sucks. Anyway I recently bought a new multivitamin that has 100% iron and it has made going to the bathroom scary. We all know iron backs you up but figured my body would adjust to the iron and things would lighten up. Not so much. I irritated my hemorrhoids so much they started bleeding regularly and it hurt to go #2 (I hate it when i read things saying hemorrhoids dont hurt when you use your bowels. Uhh WRONG, they absolutely hurt when they are irritated). Anyway, I started using stool softeners and hemorrhoid suppositories. The stool softeners help but when I discontinue the suppositories, they can still get irritated and bleed, which at 49, is starting to scare the hell out of me. My friend’s husband was just diagnosed with stage 3C colon cancer so now I’m terrified. Isn’t it lovely when you hear stories like that in the throws of a health concern? NOT. Anyone else experience this type of situation?"

"Piles"," Hemorrhoidectomy","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hemorrhoidectomy-656830","Hi all, I underwent a hemorrhoidectomy 18 days ago and promised myself I would share my experience for others. I have been reading other posts on here religiously over the past month or so. Some posts scared me to the point I almost pulled out of surgery!! But I believe I have a happy ending, so want to share a positive story.Quick background - I am in my mid-20s, female from the UK, I haven't had children and never suffered from chronic constipation. My consultant deemed me as a very healthy individual, therefore it came as a huge surprise to us both when he found 2 large internal haemaroids and a large skin tag. Luckily, I have private healthcare through work - I didn't have to go through the NHS and this considerably sped up the process. But I am frustrated that there is still a taboo on haemaroids. If only I plucked up the courage to be seen sooner, I could have avoided surgery. Nevertheless, I had all of the above removed under General anaesthetic. In terms of recovery, my consultant told me that I would be back to myself within a week. However, I know someone who had been through this before and said that timescale was optimistic. It's also important to add that my haemaroids had not 'clot'. I was in no pain whatsoever beforehand. Some would say I'm crazy to undergo surgery.. but my consultant said due to the size, they were not going away.. and they would bleed and clot in the future, it was just a matter of time. I do agree with other posts on here, it's important to find yourself a surgeon who specialises in this type of surgery, maintain a fibre diet, rest and drink plenty of water whilst recovering and thereafter to prevent reoccurance. My recovery can be summarised below: Day 1 - 2: I had to stay in hospital overnight due to low blood pressure. Upon waking up, I was in extreme sharp pain (this was unbearable for me but mainly because I was in no pain beforehand). However I was dosed up on morphine, ibuprofen, paracetamol and tramadol. This all took the edge off and I managed to lie down in relative comfort. Day 3 - 7: In summary, these days were the worst. The morphine had worn off and it was time to open my bowels. The hospital discharged me with ibuprofen, paracetamol, tramadol and laxitives/stool softners which I took religiously. Opening my bowels for the first time was excruciating. I had some padding put up there after surgery and had to force that out. It honestly felt like pushing out razor blades. When I looked down the toilet after, I couldn't believe the small quantity of stools in comparison to the pain I had experienced. During these days, the bath is your only friend!! Especially after bowel movement. I did not wipe for 2 weeks, down there was so swollen and sensitive that I couldn't bear it. My consultant said the anus is remarkably self cleaning, therefore sitting in a sitz bath after BM is sufficient to clean the area. When passing stools, I would recommend hovering over the seat. Do not sit, the pain is multiplied. Just simply stand and hover, try not to strain. If it's not coming, get in the bath and try again later. I read so many books whilst lying in the bath. Some days I had around 8 hot baths, they were the only place my anal muscles would relax. Around day 5 I experienced the most intense muscle spasms in my bottom. Apologies for the graphic details but it felt like my bum was behind sucked upwards. The pain was unbearable and unpredictable. Again, baths helped. At the time, I couldn't see the light at the end of the tunnel. Luckily, these spasms at that intensity only lasted 3 days maximum. I didn't get much sleep during these days, but spent my days lying in bed watching Netflix! This provided some comfort during a very dark time. I should also add, I think it's important to have someone around for at least the first few days. I couldn't get up and down the stairs and relied on my mum/boyfriend to make me food and bring me drinks. There was no chance I could even make a cup of tea, such was the pain. Day 8 - 14: I was told that after a week would be the turning point, and this was true. All of the above symptoms decreased in severity by at least 40%. It felt like the swelling had reduced, I could lie down more comfortably and therefore sleep much better. My priorities for week 2 were to get out the house (I couldn't bear being in for another week) and to restore my bowels to normal. During this 2nd week, I would either be consiptitated and uncomfortable or running to the toilet every hour to open my bowels. I stopped all medication on day 8, the tramadol was making me constipated and laxitivies seemed to give me diaoreha. I ate 2x shredded wheat every morning for fibre. Unlike the first week, each day definietly got better during this 2nd week. I found getting out the house for an accompanied 15 min walk, popping to the shops and doing gentle housework actually reduced the pain. Moving around eased the pressure for me and I would highly recommend, it also took my mind off the pain. Day 15 - 18: I have reverted back to my original diet, I only take 2x paracetamol a day if required.. and my bowels have returned to normal! I.e. BM once or twice a day. I find the fibre provided by cereal is sufficient to keep my stools formed and soft which is just what we want to prevent the haemaroids coming back! I feel 90% back to myself. I drove for the first time post-op on day 15, whilst I do still experience some discomfort sitting down, this is nothing compared to that first week. I am planning to go back to work this week, in total I would have had 2 and a half weeks off. I have an office job so wanted to ensure I can sit for hours at a time before I committed to going back. It's still somewhat painful passing stools, but I'm still hovering and now using flushable wipes to wipe. I do still have a small bath afterwards to relax the muscles and ensure everything is clean down there, but I'll have to stop this when I go back to work! It's more of a 'nice thing' to continue for the moment. I'm also still wearing sanitary pads, my consultant said leakage from that area is common for approx 6 weeks so I'll continue to wear until this stops. My partner has moved back into the bedroom, as my bottom was so sensitive and prone to spasms at the slightest movement, he has kindly been sleeping in the spare room for the past 2 weeks!I think I have covered all of the important parts, but please feel free to ask any questions if you are going through the same experience!! I'm close to 3 weeks post-op now and I almost have my pre-op life back, minus the haemaroids! In another weeks time, I think I will be able to fully appreciate the after effects of the surgery. It has been one horrendous rollercoaster, but having my friends and family to support me has kept me focused on the light!"

I went to specialist and all kinds of other doctors. I was prescribed cream which didn’t help. I also had some other procedures that didn’t help. I started to research things and this is what I figured out and it stopped the bleeding and helped with the hemorrhoids. I’m not gonna go into the why but this is what I do now on a daily basis. I take a probiotic and a prebiotic daily. I add a half a teaspoon of coconut oil to my coffee in the morning to slow the absorption of the caffeine. I try to eat more vegetables but by no means eat that healthy. I do feel better when I work out regularly but haven’t lately and still no bleeding but it does help. I try to stay away from nuts because they seem to cause inflammation in my system. I can eat them but I try not to go overboard. A lot of candy and deserts can cause me to bleed a little sometimes but not like before. I think it is when I eat a lot of garbage you can get constipated and have to strain more during bowel movements. I try to eat more vegetables and fruit to make sure I get enough fiber so I don’t get constipated and have to strain. I also have chamomile tea and manuka honey every night because that help with acid reflux which I was having a lot when I was bleeding a lot. I think my system had inflammation throughout which was causing a lot of the problems. I also use the prep h wipes after every vowel movement. Well this is my routine and has stopped the bleeding and gotten my hemorrhoids in check. I hope this helps anyone who has been suffering without any help. Good Luck."

","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/beeding-again-is-it-ok-to-just-not-worry--653873","Hi, I've been on here before and told that sorry tale about my bleeding during and after a BM. I've had several doctors tell me there's nothing to worry about and a colonoscopy showed only a couple of thrombosed veins and a healed scar.My question is whether others in my position worry about the blood when they too know the cause is nothing to worry about? I just can't stop and it's really effecting my mood, and so my life in general.I can't find any sort of pattern to the cause of why the flare ups happen, and nothing I try seems to work to make it stop once and for all. One doctor told me i need to treat it as a minor inconvenience. Can I really just ignore it and carry on with my life despite the toilet filled with blood each day? "

I have been in surgery several times and had cancer but this takes the cake! The first 2 days I was ok but day 3 was a nightmare! day 7 was also quite painful and the pressure on your anal area is very uncomfortable and almost constant. I am a nurse of 36 years and Im telling you there is no pain after surgery quite like this. I realize that having a grade 4 , prolapsed hemorrhoid was really no better in my case. This pressure is just awful. Please know going in that you WONT be able to work at a minimum for 2-3 weeks respectively. Dont buy your 2-3 day return to work unless your a low grade hemorrhoid person. I never take narcotics but let me tell you for this I DID for the first 2-3 days. There after I bit the bullet because the percocet was giving me ambient dreams and was just as troubling as the pain itself.Plan to be up almost constantly the first few nights and having anal pressure beyond comprehension and spasms. The first BM I was screaming in the bathroom... It was worse than dumb and dumber where Jeff Daniels is shi:::ING on the bowl. ( I have to smile because I cant take the agony anymore). My advise is if you are miserable with your roid, probably do this procedure, but if your doing ok leave it BE... The sitz baths saved me from an untimely death... I have a very high pain tolerance but this was like a body slam... Its rough, so be prepared. Some people end up in the ER on IV and for pain control... Luckily I made it out in one piece. Im still very uncomfortable after 9 whole days and dread even now my BMs. Stinging, burning and PRESSURE. slight bleeding but not terrible.If I can describe this its like someone taking their fist on the inside of your sphincter and pressing as hard as they can... some stinging and extreme urge to crap... The Dr told me regular diet, but I have tried to eat just one meal each day and soft foods as this is a killer. Im hoping to feel better by next week...This surgery is not for the faint of heart. Ive lost 8 lbs so far and its been a painful ride. Take care of the smaller ones early on.. before this is needed!From the agonizing trenches of THD suffering. Debi. Hemorrhoid memoirs, 2018."

This procedure was definitely worse than I had anticipated and I believed the whole “back to normal in 1-2 weeks”. The first couple weeks are definitely miserable no doubt about it. However, now 3 weeks post op, I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. I’m still taking Metamucil everyday and will continue to for the rest of my life hoping to not have to go through this again. I have a couple small amounts of tissue that is still hanging out but nonetheless, things are improving. The swelling is 95% gone, the pain after a BM is almost gone (I still take a bath after each, but it is nothing like the first week). Yesterday I played with my son in the yard and was up and down in the grass several times. In the past I would have had to go inside every 20 minutes or so to push them back in with the amount of up and down action I was doing but thankfully, this is not necessary anymore! I look forward to not having to leave a wedding, sporting event, business event, etc. every 30 minutes to go to the bathroom and push them in. Or even worse, hang out in the bathroom to stop the unwanted bleeding that never came at a convienient time. This is definitely a rough procedure but I can now say, the few weeks of hell is worth getting your life back! Many people say it but it’s so true- Lots of water, lots of fiber (I swear by Metamucil now, warm baths after a BM, use preparation H wipes to clean after, and using a latex glove with frozen water is a good way to ice it). Keep the big picture in mind! All the best!!! "

"Piles","Hemorrhoidectomy - Tips for recovery ","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hemorrhoidectomy-tips-for-recovery-649631","Hey all,Well I’m on day 25 now, and before I start to forget all the things that helped me, I will write them down for you all. I scoured the internet, read some real horror stories - but I am now through it and hopefully this might give you some hope and help as you recover. I am pretty much better, taking painkillers very occasionally (once per day, if at all).I’ll skip the day by day recap (there's enough of those out there!) and give you what I think might be helpful tips.There are some real horror stories out there, and it’s definitely not a nice thing to go through, but you can get through it. Think of how many success stories there are, but just not put on the internet. Only the horror stories seem to make it on. Hope my positive story and tips help.My situation:- I had grade 3 hemmorhoids removed.. big ones. Surgery, not banding.- Drugs: Targin (Oxycontin and something else) for 5 days, along with 1000g paracetamol + 400mg ibuprofen. Movicol twice a day to ease the constipation effects.- Day 12 I went back to work in the office. Not great, but I had to do it. Used paracetamol + codeine as painkillers, which helped. Also, I think moving around actually helped. Because from day 12 onwards I was getting stronger and stronger, and my recovery picked up a great deal. So maybe forcing myself off my backside and moving around a bit helped. But I’m not sure, could be coincidence. - Day 15 I was able to sit without pain! I’d usually have a painkiller but up until this point that would not have got rid of the pain or the uncomfortableness. But from this day, I started to have bouts of feeling “normal”- Day 25: Slight uncomfortble-ness, but not too bad at all. I’m able to sit, swim etc. But am careful not to exert or lift heavy things. When I do that, my bum hurts! Every day is better.. hopefully soon it will be all better.So on to my tips.My tip for the first day:Even if you can’t feel anything, don’t do much: in retrospect I did too much moving around when I couldn’t feel a thing, thinking everything was ok… they put a nerve block in, so I couldn’t feel a thing. Moving around was probably a bad idea, next time (hopefully there won’t be one!) I will just lie down and watch some movies. I probably aggravated the rawness down there which may have made it worse later on. In the evening I started my first Targin tablets (this is Oxycodone and something else to stop the constipation effect of the Oxy). I had 5 days worth of these to see me through the worst (however I needed longer.. more on that later), and Movicol to also help counter the constipation (twice a day).My tip for taking the meds?I took the Targin (Oxycodone) for the first 5 days.. but also at the same time every 4 hours I took Ibuprofen + Parecetamol (Tylenol in the USA I think). None of those interact with each other, so it was safe to take all of them.- Don’t miss taking them!! A couple of times I went past the 4 hour mark, thinking that everything felt a bit better.. big mistake - I would get crippled with pain as they wore off - I would take Ibuprofen + parecetamol immediately when this happened but it takes some time to act, so I would be in more pain than I needed to be in. So for the first 10 days or so, keep taking them all.- When my Targin ran out, I went back to my pre-op meds which I had: Panadeine Forte (Paracetamol + codeine).. I took 500mg of those when I woke up, along with 400mg Ibuprofen.. because I knew I had to poop (usually did in the morning). This seemed to help. Then as time went on (day 14 or so onwards) I wouldn’t need to take them in the morning.. just occasionally if the pain got too bad/uncomfortable.My tip for poopingSmartphone + YouTube: I would get little warning that I would go need poop (probably the movical), but I did just have time to unlock my smartphone, launch youtube and click on anything on the home screen (actually got into Will Smith’s you tube channel) and play it rather loud! I would stick this in front of me on the floor and it would distract me somewhat from what was happening. I think this helped.. try it, it can’t worsen the situation!- Put your feet on books / putting your feet on tip toes to raise the angle of your legs: whilst sitting on the toilet, I lifted the angle of my legs by lifting my heels off the ground, then later, used a book to lift them up. This helped the poop come out easier.- Baby wipes: very very gentle dabs were better than wiping. I did just enough to get me from toilet to shower- Shower: Straight after pooping, I would head into the shower.. hot water.. and I would cup my bum crack so that my arse would sit in some hot water… this really helped. A couple of times, my wife ran me a bath when it was too much lying on the bed. As others have said, this really does help. The shower was always there though, so I used this mainly. Straight into it after pooping. I would gently clean the area with some fingers full of shower gel. This was more effective than trying to wipe/dab clean.- Constipation: One day, about Day 14 I got constipated.. I had been taking the codeine for pain, and also movicol but i was blocked up. Not nice at all. I pooped just little bits about 6 times in a day. Quite painful. My tip, watch out for codeine, it will block you up. Maybe take extra movicol if you move onto codeine. I should have done that.My tips for bum leakageYes, your bum is going to leak, especially after a poop. It’s hard to keep it clean. Shower or bath after, but then you’re still gonna make a mess of your underwear I’m afraid. Until I found out about this...- Womens sanitary pads: Seriously, this tip is a lifesaver! It soon became apparent my arse was not doing a good job of it’s main function: keeping my poop out. Keeping things clean down there is a problem for the first couple of weeks. I would change my boxer shorts 3 or 4 times a day, and I found the bed sheets were a mess in the morning. I pretty much fixed both of these after I found a tip online: use those stick on sanitary pads that women use. Not the ones ""with wings"", but the feather light ones which have a sticky back to them. I could stick these vertically inside my boxer shorts.. this would capture 90% of the leakage, and I could just change the pads rather than by underwear. Also worked for overnight too. But just to be sure in the first few nights when I didn’t have pads, I slept on a towel.My tips for swelling / “oh no! I feel haemorrhoids *after* the op!""?- Worry not: On day 2 I became pretty depressed, as I managed to feel “down there” and I could feel what felt like external haemorrhoids.. NO! I thought - the op didn’t work! I obsessed about this for a few days, it was not nice. My lovely wife actually took some photos with my phone.. yuck - what a mess. Big swollen bits sticking out, worse than I went into the op. I mailed it to my surgeon.. he said he’s pretty sure its just swelling, and will die down after a while. I didn’t really believe him.. but after 10 days I went to visit him and again he said the same thing. They are not hems but will take 6 weeks or more to go down. They are skin tags, I’m now sure of it. As I write this on day 25, I still have them but they are getting softer and slightly smaller. I have been able to sit down and they don’t bother me too much.There you go.. I hope this helps.Good luck! "

","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/horror-story-so-far-please-provide-something-positive-to-help-me-see-the-light--648718","My sprits are very low and I’m somwewhat depressed after today, hoping that someone out there can relate and help me see the light at the end of the tunnel. 6 days ago I had a Hemorrhoidectomy for internal hems that would frequently protrude caused severe discomfort along with massive amounts of bleeding. Day of surgery was ok thanks to all the mess. Day 1 lots of pain that I assumed was normal and what everyone was referring to. Day 2 I had to visit the ER as there was what I came to find out 8 feet of gauze inside me that I could not pull out myself after 3 or 4 feet in the shower and bowl movement did not remove either. The pain from the doctor yanking that from my rear end was excruciating to say the least!! Went home in sever pain with what I assumed was “normal swelling” and pain, I was absolutely miserable the pain so bad that I was unable to sleep at all and walking or sitting was completely out of the question. Day 5 I called surgeon as I was still having scale 1-10 pain, 10! Brings me to today, Day 6, after seeing the surgeon he says, “wow this is worse than before the surgery”. Somehow the tissue he had left made its way out and formed hemorrhoids that were causing all of the “pain/ swelling”. Within three hours I was back on the table being put to sleep for surgery again. After waking from surgery I was in unbelievable pain to say the least. When the nurse and my wife started helping me get dressed after recovery, they were helping change dressings for the large amount of bleeding and then my worst nightmare and the reason I have hit rock bottom- the nurse and my wife notice that there is a small hemorrhoid protruding literally a couple hours of having everything cut out again. The pain is much less then it has been the past 5 days but the bleeding is much more! I just can’t believe after all of this, I’m still not completely fixed and could not be anymore defeated. I’m hoping all of this ends up working for the better but for now, I’m just beside myself. Has anyone had to go through this amount of complication? How are things now 1-2 months later? There’s a chance I might have to go under for a 3rd surgery and am just at wits end.. any encouragement/ positive stories greatly welcomed!! "

I had a colonoscopy because of my recurring problems with hemorrhoids, but it was never sever enough to have anything done to them. I got pregnant at 25 and developed severely thrombosed hemorrhoids which were very painful, in fact they were a concern for my OBGYN when I was going to give birth and they had the colorectal surgeon on stand by in case I needed emergency surgery... luckily none of that happened and I had a pretty seamless birth experience. But that’s not why we’re here, obviously by the title you can see that I ended up having a hemorrhoidectomy almost 3 weeks ago. I not only suffered from hemorrhoids but I also have fibromyalgia with chronic fatigue syndrome, fibro is a chronic pain illness with no cure so pain is my number one enemy in day to day life. When I learned I had to have surgery my main concern was the pain and how I was going to take care of my 1 1/2 year old toddler, the doctor forewarned me of the pain and told me I should set up child care being that I am a stay at home mom. SO I FALL DOWN THE GOOGLE RABBIT HOLE OF HEMORRHOIDECTOMY PAIN. I read all these AWFUL stories and I nearly canceled my procedure numerous times out of the fear that I would be in awful pain, add a chronic pain illness into the mix and I thought I was done for. Well I put on my big girl panties and decided to go through with it, I figured the outcome would be worth it in the long run. I get to the pre op area and I am so scared I was given something to relax me then boom into the operating room I go... when I wake up the first thing that happens is that I pee myself, now this is embarrassing but it’s a good thing because that means I have gone to the bathroom and I can go home. While waiting to fully regain consciousness I start feeling pain, I think “oh no here it comes” the pain is at a 6/10 but I immediately tell the nurse who kindly brings me a pain killer to get me through the drive home (which unfortunately was a 45 mins drive.) So I get home and I am just tired, I go to sleep and have my husband wake me up in a couple of hours for my next dose of the pain killer and we added a stool softener per drs orders. When he wakes me up the pain is at a 4/10 to which he says “the dr said today would be the worse of the pain” and I was SO surprised, was this is? Was this as bad as it was going to be? Ok let’s fast forward cause this post is getting SO LONG lol... Day 5, pain isn’t bad at all! I’ve halved my dose of pain killer but I’m still taking it every 6 hours as directed; I’m uncomfortable but not in pain, however, I have not pooped. I call the drs office and they ask me to come in, his nurse practitioner examines my wound, presses on my belly and tells me I am not terribly constipated but they do need to get me to poop, she gives me some suggestions like more water, miralax, and milk of magnesia if the miralax doesn’t work in a couple of days. I take miralax and try to increase my fluids (the pain killers make me nauseated so it was very difficult to do this). Day 7: bowel movement. Ok so up until now recovery has been pretty painless, my pain being at a 6 at the worse and that was when I first got out of surgery.... until I went to the bathroom. I sat on the toilet and the pain was an 11, I thought I was going to throw up and pass out from the pain. I had a movement and I cried in my shower for about 10 minutes. I swear I’m traumtized.... I spend the rest of the day in bed with pain at a 7, started taking a full dose of the pain killer and kept taking my stool softeners. Day 8: another bowel movement, here we go, another painful painful experience. I’m scared and pacing all over my house, I on my knees praying because I know the pain I’m about to experience. Now this is graphic but I’m writing to explain the process in a way where people might consider the surgery and not think it’s the devil, I sit on the toilet and it all comes out at once, 3 seconds I was done (was a soft serve like consistency), pain level? 6, I hopped into the shower and that was it, I was okay. Day 9: third bowel movement, pain level 5. I am on day 17 now and I am able to go to the bathroom with a pain level of a 2, I have had days where I have 3 BM and days where I only have 1. I am pretty much back to normal, the most annoying part is wearing pads because you will have some discharge from your wound, normal healing process but it means I take a shower about 5 times a day. I really hope this can help someone who needs to have this procedure. If you’ve made it to the end of this I promise it’s not that bad and it’s worth it, you’ll be back to normal before you know it.

Finally, recently, I got a nice health insurance and made my appointment which was today. I was so sure that, I was going to be told that my hems are so bad that the only way is hemorrhoidectomy, and I was actually ready for that, I just wanted to get rid of them so bad I was ready for the pain.But it didnt turn out that way, after the exam the doctor told me I have anal fissures, one in the back and one in the front and that is the sort of pain, no external hems, maybe litlle internal ones but they are not the main problem now. NO surgery is needed for now, he prescribed some creams and I ll see him 6 weeks later.I dont know if fissure is any better than hem, but sure it gives me a hell of pain after every bm. But my point here is go get it checked, you may not have insurance you may spend some pretty bucks but it is worth it, the first step to recovery is knowing what you are dealing with, happy and healthy days to everyone.

So my decision to go for surgery was best and only option.One thing, I would say is : (1) Take care about what to eat. (2) Do not try to recover fast. (3) Give time to heal (4) Avoid sitting for 10 / 15 days. (5) Make drinking water (preferably warm) your passtime.And Surgery will be successful and very relaxing.Hope this will help"

Suffering with an external (pea sized to almost a small grape ) causes me no discomfort, pain . But also at least one internal grade 3, it’s almost connected to the external) again no pain, nothing. Except blood, sigh last week was good went 8-9 days with normal bowel days. Then while on a work trip, decided to have satay soup ( my fav) then next day 4-5 trios to the bathroom, still no blood, but knew it would come. Get on my flight home, go to the truck, low tire , drive carefully to a gas station. Put air in, and squatting, and fighting with the hose. After I’m done, feeling wet, check and blood all over. So wander in to the bathroom, took 5min to get it stopped, look down see blood on the boxers, beige work pants . Make a run to the truck, got my suit case in there, change clothes, drive home. Wash out the pants and boxers and go to bed. No bowel movement till tonight ( 3 days or so) normal soft stool, with the standard blood, clots on the toilet paper) but again a completely painless. So I’m learning what foods to avoid, in creased fiber this week, it’s hard, I hate asking th wife to make separate meals for me, so I stick to cereal and high fiber foods on my own. No the million dollar question, it’s going to take 8 weeks to get in for surgery, doctor recommends surgery, banding is not an option. Normally I’m so proud of Canada’s healthcare system, but we don’t have many options for a 2nd opinion or asking for alternative options. So I still wanna make it through the summer ( praying that I don’t have a “burst” had 3 in the past 2 years, twice on the golf course ( my fav summer activity ) and this past one. But I see all these comments on pain, avoid at all cost, live with it. What to do! Why can’t there be a magic cream to reduce the size of it! Or at least keep it inside damit.

And honestly I wish I had never had it done but for my it was the only option as I had struggled for years with internal and external and in the end they got so painful I had to go on sick from work as I couldn’t sit down or stand for too long and was on tramadol 8 times a day for the pain which hardly touched it to be fair, I’m only 25 had a c section with my daughter so we’re they popped up from I don’t know. Anyways mine were so bad and painful and always bleeding I ended up severely aneamic and ended up needing 5 blood transfusions last November so this was my only option.I read about the surgery watched videos etc and thought this is not even going to be that bad everyone is exaggerating how wrong I was. I am supposed to be going to Amsterdam for a girls trip tomorrow 7 days post op and had to cancel as there’s no way I would of made it and was silly to even think I would be back at work 6 days after and on a ferry for 2 night and Amsterdam 7 days later lol. I had my surgery last Wednesday the whole procedure was weird there was lots of people sat in day surgery then loads of nurses came through to give you your name band and take your blood pressure then you took 2 paracetamol and went through to speak to the anethesist who tried pushing me to have a spinal block so I was awake during the procedure but I really didn’t want to as I had this with my daughter during c section and you cannot move for hours so I opted for the general anaesthesia then I saw my surgeon who said you will be in pain for 2 weeks and I laughed and said no I’ll be fine cannot be worst than the pain I’m in now, Then they called me through and I went into a room with about 5 people in with curtains and beds and got fully undressed and into my gown and taken into the theatre room were I was put too sleep. I then woke up in recovery and the first thing I said as I was coming round is can I touch it which made the nurses laugh, within an hour I could feel a pressure which she said was the packing but then came back and said oh you haven’t got any in there and gave me more pain killers and said I could have some toast and get ready to wait in another waiting room to be collected so I did but at this point I couldn’t really sit down so asked for a pillow to sit on and slightly on my side. I was then given a bag full of laxatives and fibre drink to take home with instructions on and to just continue to take my tramadol. I got to my mums house and managed to have a wee and thought this is great I feel amazing apart from the pressure down there and managed to have a feel it felt bumpy but amazing and could feel a stitch..Then the next morning I woke up still felt great me and my mum were like this is amazing a walk in the park so I went home got straight into bed as I was still tired...Then within a few hours I passed my first bowel movement and wow I was sweating and shaking I was screaming in pain and had to run into a bath we’re i still continued to shake and scream for at least the next hour thinking how can I cope with this...I finally managed with help to get out the bath and lay in bed just still and in shock still waiting for the throbbing and muscle spasms to go away and eventually fell asleep...This continued with every vowel movement for the next 4 days and it was the worst experience of my life I would rather of had contractions a thousand times over than this pain. I spent all 4 days crying shaking scared to go to the toilet screaming so I eventually on Sunday day 4 rang the hospital begging for help asking what I could do and they sent me an ambulance as I was in so much pain I had not had a wee in 17 hours so they came and wanted to take me in but there was not enough beds and honestly I didn’t want to go in I wouldn’t have my privacy to go to the toilet and sit in a bath and just cry and scream till it was over so they managed to ring the hospital and get me a prescription for Oxycodone a small mg of morphine and wrote me a medication plan out to take medication every 2 hours even during the night to alternate taking ibeuprofen my paracetamol and Morphine so I set all my alarms and thought well I don’t have any other choice do I. So here I am 2 days later on day 6 and if I didn’t have that plan or that morphIne I don’t think I would actually be here as dramatic as it sounds but I am and it is slowly getting better it does still hurt very badly to have a bowel movement I make sure I have a bath ran so I can jump straight in and just lay there waiting for the muscle spasms to stop and the pain to subside then I slowly get back into bed. For anyone who is wanting to get this done just because it looks horrible I would honestly put up with it it really is not the end of the world I would only ever get this surgery if it was needed for health reasons which mine really was needed for that it has been the worst 5 days of my life and did not think I would make it but today day 6 has been a turn around I can slightly walk better and move around in bed and slightly sit with a raised pillow under me but them bowel movements I still dread knowing I have the pain after but there’s no tears and I get throUgh it every time and hopefully from now each day is going to get better...I regret having the operation as I didn’t prepare myself fully with the pain but in the long run I know 100% this will be the best fOr me once my hemoglobin gets to a healthy level and I can regain my confidence back and be and return to work and look back and think wow I did it I made it...I hope this story helps people to make the right decision and that it is bad very very bad but it does and will get better just stay on top of your pain meds and definitely your stool softeners and if you need the help ask for it you really are a cabbage for the next week... I’m slowly able to walk and managed to wash all my underwear and towels I have used this past week so that’s bad a stepping stone!!

"Piles","1 day post op","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/1-day-post-op-642434","Hi everyone so had my surgery yesterday morning. In lots of pain with spasms in my sphincter. Doc said internal ones were also grade 4 and massive, and both the internal and external hems were much bigger than when he saw them in December . He used 8 sutures in the internal ones. He said he's left a couple of the external ones ( a couple of the external ones seemed to shrink a bit when he cut into some of the internal ones) and cut out the rest as he thought it might lead to too much scar tissue if he did all of them at the one time as they were so big and he was worried about anal stenosis.

He used 8 sutures in the internal ones. He said he's left a couple of the external ones ( a couple of the external ones seemed to shrink a bit when he cut into some of the internal ones) and cut out the rest as he thought it might lead to too much scar tissue if he did all of them at the one time as they were so big and he was worried about anal stenosis.

"Piles","My cure for piles","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-cure-for-piles-638361","I first got piles while giving birth to my first child 8 years ago and have suffered with them regularly ever since. A big problem for me is that I am allergic to the over the counter piles treatment which makes me red, sore and itchy. Not ideal! Last November I suffered a particularly severe bout of external piles which left me bed bound for 3 weeks! I was in agony and spent my time reading everything I could about piles determined to find a cure/ way to prevent them coming back. Initially I was frustrated as was already doing most of the things the internet suggested to prevent piles: I’m not overweight, I don’t drink or smoke, I take regular exercise running 2-3 times per week and eat a vegan diet. It didn’t seem fair that I had them! I was in so much pain, I couldn’t walk, sit, sleep, let alone work. I felt like I’d never get better as each day I seemed to be getting worse. But based on what I read I’ve made the following changes: I bought a kegel8 pelvic floor machine which I have been using daily for the past 3 months as I read that having a strong pelvic floor can help prevent piles (even if it doesn’t improving my pelvic floor can’t be a bad thing). I bought a ‘go better toilet stool’ from the stress no more website. This is a footstool which you use to put yourself in a more natural position to go to the toilet. I have also made a conscious effort to eat, not just vegan, but a more whole food plant based diet. (Eating more fibre and going to the loo more seems counter intuitive as it’s the last thing you want to do but it really is important). I ate things like porridge which flax and chia seeds, more fruit, vegetable soup, baked beans. And.... So far so good. I feel great and there is absolutely no sign of piles. I’m not sure which change is most responsible for the improvement but if I had to guess I’d say it was putting my feet up on the stool to go to the loo. I now wouldn’t go any other way. You can buy a specially designed stool that fits round the toilet or just use a pile of book etc but give it a go. When I first bought the stool I was in so much agony I couldn’t bare to put my feet up that high so had to just use 2 toilet rolls on the floor to only raise my feet a bit but after a week or so I could bare to get my feet up and I’ve never looked back. I’m writing this in the hope that these suggestions may help someone else. When I was suffering I was trawling the internet trying to find anything to help but struggled to find much other than horror stories. If you’re suffering now you have my heartfelt sympathy. I really hope one or all of the steps that helped me, will help you too. X "

I did have another episode on the golf course last year, during the middle of the round, thank goodness a restroom was right there.

"Piles","Hemorrhoidectomy - My experience","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hemorrhoidectomy-my-experience-624430","First of all, thank you everyone for your posts on these patient forums. I found it very useful, and reassuring, to hear about other experiences and it was good to not feel alone. I've decided to submit my own account of recovering from the surgery as I found it so helpful reading others.I'm a 56 yr old woman and have struggled to manage constipation for many years. I've periodically had complications resulting from constipation – including an anal fissure (which required surgery), thrombosed hemorrhoids, hemorrhoids that I've had injected, banded, and now (finally!) removed. I've never had children.It's Saturday today and I'm on day 4 after my surgery which I had on Tuesday 28th November. So far, I would say I've been very fortunate in that I don't seem to be having such a bad experience as some others I read about. Don't get me wrong, the pain during and following a BM is horrible, there's no getting away from it. And when the pain lingers it's debilitating. But I'm also having plenty of pain free time, and I'm sleeping amazingly well. I expect some of that will have been down to the General Anaesthetic and pain killers, but as someone who seldom gets enough sleep, I'm really appreciating the extra hours! I'm signed off work for 2 weeks and expect I will take the full 2 weeks. I don't feel very mobile yet and once the pain kicks in you don't want to be anywhere other than home and near your bathroom.So I'll say a bit about Tuesday. My admission was at 11am so I went without breakfast and made sure I drank a lot of water before the 9am cut off – I drank about 2L. Once at the hospital, there was a lot of waiting around – the operation wasn't until about 2pm, and we didn't leave until around 6:30pm. Preparation for the op was as described by others on this forum and ultimately included an enema, which I'd never had before. I was a bit ignorant about the enema, I expected it to be more like the preparation I had for a full colonoscopy last year, but the clear out from an enema is much more localised to the rectum, in preparation for surgery. I was a bit disappointed by that as I was hoping to not need a BM for a couple of days after surgery (in the end my BMs started the next day)! The consultant did quite a nice job of describing the operation and explained that they start by stretching the rectum open so they can take a good look before deciding what to remove. Lol it's all so undignified isn't it but what can you do?!! The full procedure normally takes about 50 minutes. In the end I was away from my room for almost 2 hours though – apparently they had a job getting me to wake up again! That aside, the consultant felt the op had gone well and that he'd removed 2 particularly large hems and it had been very worthwhile. When I came round, I was already aware of a throbbing pain and also felt ready to spend a penny … the latter being a good sign as they won't let you home until you've done that. Once back in my room, a nurse came to discuss pain management and once I'd had something to eat, I was given a pain killer.Back in 2001, I had lateral internal sphincterotomy for a fissure that wouldn't heal. The pain killer I was prescribed then was Diclofenac. I didn't respond well to Diclofenac and had a very painful stomach to add to my woes during recovery. This time, they suggested I had a different type of pain killer that was less likely to upset my stomach – so I've been taking Tramadol, along with Paracetemol, and laxatives (mostly Senna) to deal with the constipation brought on by pain killers. I find the Tramadol great even though it makes me quite drowsy – but it definitely helps with the pain. Senna is best taken at night time so that it works while you're asleep, ready for the next day. As I have problems with constipation, I've decided to supplement the Senna with another laxative in the morning but I think I overdid it today and 3 BM in one morning wasn't a lot of fun! I don't know how long I'll take the Tramadol for, I'm tempted to move onto Ibuprofen instead in a couple of days as Tramadol is pretty strong from what I understand.I had read that days 4 and 5 can be the most painful and I would agree that today has been my most painful so far. The BM itself is obviously painful but I find it leaves my whole abdominal area in pain and spasm for quite some time afterwards. Almost like a very heavy period pain combined with a raw pain from the wound itself. The pain killers usually help but I can only take them every 6 hours. Things settled down after a few hours today, and I feel comfortable again now.Anyway I just thought I'd share a few other thoughts and suggestions that have helped me:Make sure you have everything you need at home before going for your surgery. My list included:- Comfie tracksuit bottoms – you won't want to wear anything less comfortable for a couple of weeks at least.- Sanitary Towels – you'll be a bit leaky after surgery – I don't know how long this stage lasts for.- Baby wet wipes.- Peppermint tea – this can help reduce wind, and trumping hurts after surgery!- Paracetemol- Very mild soap- PrunesI'm drinking lots of water and I find that drinking warm water is better for me than cold. My partner and colleagues are a bit sniffy about me drinking warm water, they think it sounds disgusting, but I actually like it and if I don't think about it too much I can even imagine it's like a (weak) cup of tea! I think it helps with the constipation – maybe because I find I can drink more of it when it's warm. It's something I've discovered in the last couple of years.I generally maintain a high fibre diet and have focussed on the same this week – and yes I probably over did it today! - but the idea of having to strain for a BM … well it just wouldn't be possible! I think providing you drink lots of water, then high fibre eating is essential after surgery.I read about the Squatty Potty and decided to order one. It only just arrived today so I can't tell you what I think of it yet.The other thing I did was to have a toilet bidet shower installed. I can't recommend it highly enough. I first came across one on holiday in Turkey several years ago and loved it. My brother has one in his house and I recently stayed with friends who'd attached one to both the loos in their house. Generally though, I think bidets (and bidet attachments) are sniggered about and I'm not sure why – they make so much sense really. Anyway, I finally had one installed a few months ago and it's brilliant. I'm finding it particularly useful now, given that I can't use paper. Mine is only cold water … and given the cold weather it's VERY cold water, but that's OK as far as I'm concerned and still soothing. I believe you can get ones that run hot and cold as well.I'm also very carefully using baby wipes and YES the lovely warm baths – I'm having at least one of those plus a shower each day. For some reason they are a great form of pain relief as well as helping you feel clean.I don't have anything else to report today but will send another update in a day or so. "

"Piles","A ""Good"" Hemorrhoidectomy Experience","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/a-good-hemorrhoidectomy-experience-639839","I decided I needed to write this post to help the next poor guy or gal facing this surgery who stumbles upon all the horror stories out thereTL/DR: My experience was not nearly as terrible as most of the posts on here make it out to be.I'm a 41 year old male in good health. I've had internal hemorrhoids for at least 20 years, but they'd gotten much worse over the past year or so. It had gotten to the point that they would protrude after most bowel movements and any moderate activity would cause them to swell and be painful. They had also started to bleed, so off to the doctor I went and she recommended a hemorrhoidectomy.Starting about two weeks prior to my surgery, I made a conscious effort to increase my fiber intake. I don't generally suffer from constipation, but this seemed a wise idea anyway.My surgery went smoothly. I woke in the recovery room with ZERO pain; in fact, I could barely even tell anything had been done. Very quickly, the nurse had me up and in the bathroom. I had heard that urinating after surgery can be difficult due to the swelling in the area, but I had no problems at all and had a normal pee. I was discharged and on my way home. I was prescribed hydromorphone (dilaudid), ibuprofen, a stool softener, and a topical gel (metrogel).When I got home, I had a large glass of apple juice and some crackers. I was still feeling a bit out of it due to the general anesthesia, so I went to bed. Even though I wasn't feeling any pain, I took a dilaudid based on the nurse's recommendation.My surgeon had advised me ahead of time that she uses a very strong local anesthetic that lasts for 2 or 3 days, so the next morning, I still had very little pain, though I was starting to be aware that something had happened down there. I took off the bandages from the hospital (just loose gauze, really); there was very little blood. I took a few short soaks in a warm tub throughout the day. I bandaged myself with a small 2x2 gauze pad (with the metrogel on it) between the cheeks and a larger gauze pad to line my underwear. These I changed several times a day. I was able to be up and moving somewhat comfortably. The next day was more of the same, though the area was starting to ache more. I want to stress that it was an aching feeling, not a sharp, acute pain like I'd been expecting. I took ibuprofen a few times during the day, but tried to stay away from the dilaudid as I wanted to avoid the side effects of constipation if I could.The third day (not including the day of the surgery) was definitely the worst. By evening, that powerful local had worn off and there was a definite increase in the pain level. Also, I had developed a fever and was worried that meant infection. Ultimately, I took the dilaudid for the pain and more ibuprofen for the fever. Even on this day, though, I would describe the pain as ""significant"" but not ""agonizing"" and it certainly wasn't constant. Hot baths helped quite a bit.The next morning was better, but not great, and it was time for the first bowel movement. I was VERY constipated and it took a HUGE effort to get it out. Surprisingly, however, it wasn't painful, it was just VERY, VERY difficult. I didn't even bother trying to wipe; I just got straight into the shower. I learned my lesson and started taking the stool softeners regularly. I would have another difficult bowel movement the next morning and an almost normal one the day after that.Frankly, after that difficult bowel movement, the worst was over. I stopped the dilaudid, eased back on the ibuprofen, but continued taking the stool softener and applying the metrogel for a few more days. I was back to work 10 days after surgery.I'm now 6 weeks post op. I had a followup at 4 weeks and mentioned that I was having some minor ""leakage"". She noticed that some of the stitches had not yet dissolved and said that can sometimes contribute to the leakage. She removed them in the office and it helped a bit, but I still have the occasional unclean feeling.Overall, it was a positive experience. I can now go to the bathroom without worrying about my hemorrhoids protruding and causing pain every time.So, with all that said, here are my tips for anyone looking at this surgery:1) Before surgery, increase your fiber intake. You do not want to be constipated.2) Have some clear liquids and soft foods available for the first few days. Apple juice, grape juice, bananas, chicken broth, Ensure drinks, etc.3) After surgery, skip the opioid painkillers if you can. The constipation is not worth it. That said, however, don't let the pain get ahead of you. If you need them, take them.4) DO take the ibuprofen if it's prescribed. I think the anti-inflammatory nature is as helpful as the pain killer.5) DO take the stool softeners, and start taking them right away.6) Drink lots of water.7) Lots of hot baths and showers.8) Sign up for Netflix and watch a lot of movies while you recover!-Ed"
"Piles","A few things I want to share after my hemorroidectomy- 15 days Post Op!","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/a-few-things-i-want-to-share-after-my-hemorroidectomy-15-days-post-op--639542","I am a 33 year old female in the US. After my pregnancies my hemorrhoids were a huge ordeal. Caused me pain after bowel movements, bleeding episodes, limited my ability to travel, and also caused pain even when just standing. They were a major problem in my life. So going into the hemorrhoidectomy- I literally at no choice. I couldn't keep living with hemorrhoids impacting my life in such a negative way. I had tried banding over 10 different times, tried every cream- altered diet completely- nothing would work. So I knew I had to face the surgery and I read EVERY SINGLE ENTRY online about this surgery. I was terrified, but I knew I needed to do it. So now that I am 15 days post op I wanted to share my experience with whomever is in the same place I was. I hope this helps someone.First- my rhoids were grade 3 internal and external and as I said they caused me pain and many problems. If you have rhoids that are not causing you pain- I STRONGLY suggest not having surgery. This surgery should be a LAST RESORT. Find a surgeon with compassion. I have seen many colon-rectal surgeons who just show such a lack of empathy, and I promise you a surgeon with compassion will make a huge difference as your recovery continues.Every blog talks about the first week. I hate to say this but I want to be honest and for you to be prepared with what is ahead. It IS as bad as every blog says- at least for me. Maybe even worse than I read. I ended up in the ER for the first night, and then second day passed out from pain/medications and was taken to the hospital to be admitted for 5 days. I am in the US so they wanted it be outpatient but there was NO WAY that was happening. I couldn't even pee for 6 days on my own- literally! I think for me the problem was that I was not reacting well to the narcotics. So those first 5 days were just torture and there was a lot of pleading and praying for medication to kick in. But by day 6 I felt a cloud lifted and was able to look out the window in my hospital room and feel there would be a light at the end of the tunnel. When I think what helped me those first days it would be ice packs and sitz baths. I ate mostly soft foods, fruits and veggies. Honestly I couldn't even eat much. I was careful not too take too many laxatives as I didn't want to be going more than 2 times a day. I went with prune juice instead to keep things moving. If you need to- go in the sitz bath. It sounds disgusting (and it is) but desperate times calls for desperate measures. it will be not forever. As soon as you go rinse yourself off quickly however you can. That will help the burning pain. The first few bowel movements had me shaking and sobbing, but by the 4th or 5th I started to feel like I could manage it. But here I am 15 days later still using the sitz bath to help. I am ok with that because that is a lot better than the extreme burning and stinging pain.By the time I hit the end of the first week my pain management was under control and I had medication that was working. So it was much easier to get to week 2 compared to getting to the end of week 1. Every single day you are closer to healing. Stay positive and remember the worst is behind you at this point. I am on day 15 now and still have swelling and been icing. But I was able to leave the house yesterday for a bit and today I cleaned up the downstairs pretty good because I haven't been able to clean and things were quite a mess!I do still use a gauze pad and have been since the first day of surgery to catch anything leaking or coming out. I feel like I am making progress but am still on medication to help with the pain.With all this said- WOULD I DO IT AGAIN!? Lord I Pray I NEVER have to! Would I encourage someone else to do it- Well? If it is impacting your life as it was mine then I would say yes do it. But first ask your doctor how they handle situations where the pain medication isn't working for a patient? Would they be willing to admit you to the hospital? My Dr admitting me to the hospital was a life saver. Some of the other doctors on his team was pushing me to be discharged on day 3 and my doctor wouldn't allow it until I had my bowel movement and pain was under control. I am extremely grateful for that. So find a Dr with compassion and ask about that. If your hemorrhoids are bad as mine were, the recovery will be more involved. Make sure you have someone by your side that entire first week. And don't expect to be back to work or caring for children prior to the 2 wk mark. I can't really say if this surgery took away all of my pain and problems after bowel movements because I am still healing. But I will check in after a month or two for an update. I am praying for full healing!!If anyone has any questions or anyway I can help- reach out. "

"Piles","Hemorrhoidectomy. My experience.","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hemorrhoidectomy-my-experience--639021","Hello all,I had a hemorrhoidectomy on Friday 9th February 2018. My appointment was booked for 0730am that day although I did not actually go to theatre until closer to 1530hrs that day. That in itself is quite hard to take because you are not allowed to eat or drink prior to the surgery.I woke from the general anesthetic at around 1730hrs. Prior to surgery the surgeon sat me down and advised that there were two options, 1) Stapling the hemorrhoids and 2 cutting them away. He discussed the pro's and cons of both which were,Stapling - A slower recovery time, less pain but a stay over night due to the probability that I would bleed.Cutting the hemorrhoids away - Sever pain, faster recovery and can go home the same day so long as everything goes to plan. He advised that a decision would be made as to which option they would progress whilst I was on the operating table. In the end the decision was made for full removal by cutting the hemorrhoids away.The first mistake that I made was to believe that they were wrong about the level of pain. I chose to discharge myself at circa 2130hrs that same evening. The nurse advised me of the medication that I would need to take which included metronidazole, Senna, Omeprazole, Lactulose Solution and Coedine. So the biggest mistake I made was to believe that there was no pain and any would be manageable. At circa 0400hrs I awoke to some of the worst pain I have ever experienced. I suffer from Diverticular Disease and the pain I get with that I can often take some way before I need to take pain suppressants. I would even go as far as to say that it was worse than when my appendix went and when I broke my nose playing football.By 0700hrs I was back in hospital and was immediately given liquid morphine which did not make a difference to the pain levels that I was in. Next up was for me to be given morphine by way of a drip. All of the above could have been avoided if I had chosen to stay in the care of the NHS for the night.I would never try to dissuade anyone from having surgery such as this because the truth is you are having it because it will improve your quality of life. But please do not be as stupid as I was and believe that the pain is manageable whilst you are still under the influence of a general anesthetic. The pain is going to be bad. But at the same time it is going to get better.10 days on and my experience is that it still hurts to go to the toilet. Warm salt baths after each bowel movement are helping with this. I am hopeful that today will be my first post op without me taking any pain suppressants.I am still bleeding, but it is minor and there is a small discharge so I am having to wear a pad, which as a man is embarrassing but at the same time makes me appreciate what my wife, daughters and other woman have to endure once monthly.Whilst this blog may not be the best written I wanted to share my experience and ask that anyone having a hemorrhoidectomy is well prepared for the level of pain that you will experience. But again I will say that it does get better and from my experience quite quickly too.Good luck people. And prepare yourself one hell of a pain in the proverbial. It will get better."

"Piles","Keeping Post Operative Pain to a minimum","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/keeping-post-operative-pain-to-a-minimum-637398","I I had my surgery 5 days ago I read the various horror stories on this and other sites regarding Hemorrhoidectomy in the months leading up to my surgery. I was filled with so much fear and anxiety I nearly canceled the surgery the day before. However I decided I'd rather be in pain, no matter how severe than continue to have my a painful and embarrassing prolapsed Hemorrhoid. I am 42, and currently have good health care. I didn't want to push this off til I was older and possibly had different circumstances.About 24 hours before the surgery I took 2 Tablespoons of Epsom Salt, which is a very strong laxative. I was in agony on the toilet at various points throughout that 24 hours but I surely cleared out everything that was in there. I figured that'd help the surgery and start me on a 'clean slate' after the surgery. Somewhat miraculously I finally dried out about an hour before the surgery.I was very, very anxious leading up to the surgery but the Dr and team I had were excellent. The surgery went well and I was sent home with various meds, including the all important pain medications. I think the varying results in post operative experience has to do with the skill of the surgeon, technique used, and severity of the problem being corrected. So there's no guarantee anyone's experience will be the same.Before the surgery I bought the followingWitch Hazel Wipes that are flushable. Anal desensitizing lube with 5% lidocaine. This is meant for anal sex, but I figured it might help me.A tool called Lube Launcher that is used to inject the lube. This comes in two sizes and I found the smaller size is better.An Enema BulbLots of Witch Hazel.The first two days after surgery I felt nothing due to the long lasting anesthetic they inject at the surgical site. I knew this would be short lived. I used this time to start regular usage of Witch hazel enemas, followed by the desensitizing lube, then the wipes. I then took a shower. The area is very swollen and it is quite painful to stick anything up my butt but I figured keeping the area clean and numb as possible would work to my advantage.I also have been regularly taking the Ibuprofen, and laxative products I was prescribed. In addition to this I am eating blended bean and vegetable soups, juices, and Slim Fast Shakes. I want to avoid solid stools at all costs. The pain has slowly increased everyday but I'd call it a 3 at most. I have had a lot of pain in my life, but I wouldn't say I have an above average pain tolerance.I have been having about 3 bowel movements a day. After every BM I fill the enema with Witch Hazel, lube it up and clear out. This is quite painful but seems to help the swelling and the pain is short lived. I then follow with the desensitizing lube which provides relief for up to 4 hours. I don't know if I am very lucky but I actually have not needed any of my pain medicine yet and the pain does not seem to be increasing. The bloody BMs are decreasing too. I have a feeling of being cut inside and it stings, but it is far from the agonizing pain I've read about. I don't know if I am just lucky or if my regimen is helping. It is a great feeling to not have a Hemorrhoid popping out of my butt everytime I poop. My condition was getting worse every month to the point where I could hardly push it back in. I'm very glad I had the surgery and hopefully I continue to manage the pain the way I have been."

After a few days of discomfort, the hemorrhoids shrank so that they no longer protruded after bowel movements. I am a bit confused because I have had 7 bandings with the new CRH O' Regan systems and haven't noticed a decreased in whatever is prolapsing. This newer banding method is milder and less discomfort to be sure so don't mind doing repeated bandings but was hoping to see some progress by now. My doctor says I can keep doing repeated bandings and the record for his patients is 9. I went into this not hoping to set new records but look like I am on that path. I am wondering if the fact that the hemorrhoids can be pushed back in means that they are internal hemorrhoid? Any thoughts or recommendations will be appreciated!"

Each person is unique so each contribution offers new insights that may help. If anyone has any questions I am happy to answer them butt (see what I did there), bear in mind this is only my experience.A quick background on me - not that I'm self-obsessed (far from it), but it may help you to decide whether what I have to offer is relevant to you and how realistic my expectations were.I am 50 years old, within my correct BMI, pretty sedentary (allergic to unnecessary exercise), eat reasonably well and am partial to the odd glass of wine or two. I have had a number of surgeries prior to this, including several to remove acute endometriosis and adenomyosis (Uterine lining attached deep in the muscle) and ultimately I opted for a hysterectomy 2 years ago. My other major experience of pain was childbirth.Pain wise I would put the 6-12 hours of chronic pain that I experienced each month with endometriosis up there with the Hemorrhoidectomy and I would put both of them slightly ahead of child birth. The only pain that I would put above this is the pain that I suffered with 3 ""huge"" prolapsed Hemorrhoids and a fissure prior to this operation.I am 9 days post op and whilst there is pain there is light at the end of the tunnel. I am glad I didn't read posts before the op as this would have only increased my anxiety, which would have been pointless as less invasive methods had been tried and failed. The pain on one day prior to the op reached a 10, but was usually between and 8-9 for the three weeks immediately before. I didn't really need to read the posts regarding pain as my Dr told me on numerous occasions that I would hate him for two weeks post surgery. For the record - I don't.Before I proceed I want to say that I feel for the people who had a worse recovery than me, and am mildly jealous of the people who had it easier than me. I'd say I was just below the mid-way mark based on people who actually bother to post on forums.My only regret is that I did not take stool softeners before the op because I was afraid of pooping while I was under. I had a general and for the first 12 hours after I felt blessed. I knew this was a false sense of security so I enjoyed it while I could and walked for 5 mins every 30 mins or so. Good for DVT and gets things moving. I did not take any strong meds until after the first BM so that I knew what I was dealing with and becasue the pain was only 6-7/10. This was a good move. Even without them I had to have a shed load of laxatives to get things going. It took 12 hours for the first BM (which is relatively quick from what I have read). It hurt 8/10, was mostly soft/liquid 3/10 and was closely followed by several more - each 8-9/10 with blood each time - 20-30mls. At lease I knew what I was dealing with personally. I figured the motions were too soft (I didn't want stenosis) but that I could now have stronger PM and things should balance out. TBH the pain meds did not help the pain much but they made me care about it less and helped me sleep. I had requested overnight as I wanted my first BM to be in hospital in case there were issues. I recommend doing this if it's an option. (passing the gauze was a bit scary - it was sort of pliable and I though it was one of the internals. Fortunately a nurse was able to put me straight. Whew!)After discharge I took 3 of the 12 hour slow release pain meds on the first two day and a combination of ibuprofen and paracetamol for swelling. I have also taken Valium on 2 occasions when then spasms were really bad as I did not want to get another fissure from them (this can be an issue.) I have eaten normally but taken 2 large teaspoons of Metamucil and 1 Senna stool softener each day. These have produced 3-4 substantial BM daily. There is the occasional spot of blood and mucus but nothing alarming (read other people's posts for more info on what the range of normal is). The pain varies between a 6-7 during BMs and a 4-8 with spasms after BMs. As a general rule the pain over the last 3 days has decreased on average by 0.5. I have been out for an hour or two for the last two days to build up my tolerance. I was incapacitated for 4 weeks prior and I'm back to work in 6 days (all things being equal). The antibiotics I was on for 5 days CANNOT be taken with alcohol so for once I headed this advice - make sure to check your antibiotics. It was good to get off them and return to having a glass or two of wine. I think it helped relax me and make me feel more back to normal.At 9 days, would I have this operation again knowing what I know now? Yes. I see it as short term pain for long term gain. I had put up with these since the birth of my first child 17 years ago. They caused issues on and off all that time and, as I said, they became intolerable at the end. Would I recommend it? All I can say is, it depends on your current level of pain, your pain tolerance, your expectations and your communication with your Dr. It hurts a LOT so go in with your eyes open but don't panic.I know this is a long post but I want to try to cover what I think might be helpful. Before I go I have a few more tips that I learned personally. 1) Dab don't wipe - wet wipes are your friend but they are not flushable. 2) Use a shower or sitz bath if required (I only needed a shower occasionally after BMs but there are plenty of posters who needed and benefited from sitz bath)s 3) Breath while you poop (think ante-natal classes ladies) 4) Don't try to do much if anything in the first week 5) Take pain meds if you need them but supplement them extra fibre and/or stool softners. If mine happens to be the first post you read I encourage you to read others, they cover things like not being able to pee (mostly men), hemorrhages, stitches and lots else beside. I am not able to assist here as they were not problems that I encountered fortunately. I apologise if there is TMI. I have tried to explain things without being overly graphic. As you read more you will see that there are lot more graphic accounts than this. I sincerely wish you all a speedy recovery and I will be happy if this post even helped 1 person."
"Piles","Haemorrhoidectomy: Positive recover tips! 2 weeks on!","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/haemorrhoidectomy-positive-recover-tips-2-weeks-on--569847","Hi Everyone,Its been just over two weeks from my surgery and I really wanted to post some tips that I have found/finding helpful in my recovery and some positive thoughts post haemorrhoidectomy surgery!Context:I am a 30 year old woman, slim and in fairly good health based in the UK.I have been suffering with IBS for about 15 years, haemorrhoids on and off for about the last 10 years, but more frequently in the last 5. I am a suspected coeliac, and have been gluten free for 5 years.There is a history of haemorrhoids/polyps in the family, and as much as I have tried very hard with my diet, there was no escaping them it seems!Just over two months ago, a haemorrhoid turned up, and progressively got worse to the point it was prolapsed (reoccurring from months previous). I tried every cream available but after four weeks, several doctors/hospital appts I was in agony and there was no sight of it getting better. With an impending wedding (six weeks to go) I went for a private consultation out of sheer desperation (the referral for the NHS was weeks away even though I was in A&E!).It was advised I needed surgery for an exclusional haemorrhoidectomy, using diothermy, to remove three large haemorrhoids.Like everyone else, I turned to the internet for some advice and insight … this is a good and a bad thing!There was some great information out there, but equally some horrifying stories too that really put me off. I wanted to put a list of tips that I have found helpful, and a bit about how I’m doing too because I’m feeling pretty positive about it so far, and I think its important to not let your head take over from how your feeling physically. The key: preparation, preparation, preparation!1. Diet before surgeryI was taking Fybogel (stool softener) and Laxiode (laxative) for about a week before surgery on top of a high fiber diet. This was in part because I was having difficulty passing stools because of the haemorrhoids, but on reflection I think this really helped with the recovery.I found a good balance of all the drinks/painkillers, had an idea of what all the gurgling/cramps were all about and felt like my stomach was moving well already.2. Buy spares of pants/knickers/Pj’sBuy spare pairs of pants/knickers/PJ’s before the surgery. I found I was changing about three times a day for about a week and bending down to put things in the washing machine was not going to be an option!3. Everything in reach.Go round your bedroom/bathroom/house and put everything in reach, ie not on the floor.4. Day of Surgery: Questions and snacksAsk any questions you have, regardless how silly. It will make you feel better and in more control.Take some snacks/drink with you. That sandwich that they wanted me to eat before I left … nope, not going to happen!5. First 24/48hrs: SupportHave someone drive you home, and lay down flat in the back of the car.You NEED someone with you for the first 24 hours at least. I found the come down from the general aesthetic/surgery pretty awful. I was all over the place, very unstable on my feet and unable to think properly. I couldn’t get in/out of the bath without help, let alone the stairs. If I had fallen over in this time, I am not sure I would have been able to get back up.Having someone to call on for fear of moving to cause pain was really reassuring, let alone bring you food/drinks.6. Pain medication: write it down!Keep on top of your pain medication. Set an alarm if you have to, you don’t want to let the pain take over, its really hard to wait for the painkillers to kick in.Write down what you are having and when. In the first 48 hrs I really couldn’t get my thoughts together and would forget what Id had. I managed to take too much one morning and was very sick. It also helps for the person looking after you to check in on how your doingListen to your body about what is/isn’t working. It took me a couple of days to work out that Tramadol was making me very sick! This was not helpful when trying to keep medication, food and drink down. Once I swapped out for Codine I felt a lot brighter.7. Mix laxative drinks with lemonade! (Specifically Laxiode)I found the laxatives too awful to drink straight, lemonade really helped. 8. Deep breathingYes its going to hurt, but if you have to go, go. I read a bit about the lamaze technique and found this helpful. When the pain hits its easy to just stop breathing and strain (do not do this!) Keep taking long deep breaths, I found it really helpful and gave me something to focus on.9. Squatting StoolI have a stool under my feet when having a BM. There is a strong argument that this position reduces the strain on the rectum, I have found this really helpful and recommend it. I also use an empty plastic container upturned, it easy enough to kick out of the way when finished rather than picking it up.10. Sitz bath and showersBefore a bowel movement, get the shower running. You can hop straight in and get clean without wiping (not going to happen!). Don’t use soap, it aggravates.Then run a bath (no salts or soap) and get comfortable for about 20 mins. The bath really was my savour, it really helped relieve the pain, hygiene and I felt promoting healing. (Also, make sure your plug works!)Have two towels – drying off with a wet towel just makes everything even more miserable.11. Condoms filled with water!There is nothing more entertaining than having your 60 year old mother fill condoms with water, this alone will cheer you up!.Ice packs straight after a BM and throughout the day for the first week or so were a life saver. I really feel they helped get the swelling/bruising down. Icepacks were too bulky, crushed ice in bags were either lumpy or had sharp corners.Condoms frozen in the freezer were by the best solution! Perfect shape, no leaks(!) and soft to touch.12. Moisturisera. The baths, and the laxatives, really dried out my skin. Use a good moisturiser to save flaky itchy skin.13. HydrationYou need to drink lots of water, all day long, so get a bottle of water. Drinking out of a glass was just messy and a bottle of water (a half sized one) was easier to lift and allowed me to keep track of just how much I was drinking.14. Hair dryerUsing a towel to dry off was not an option, a hair dryer was a good option. I also found when resting if I was leaking mucus a folded up tissue was helpful.I also used sanitary pads and tenna lady knickers for leakage. The knickers were really helpful to sleep in. 15. Find your routine Because of my IBS and general panic over my bowl I was terrified about BM’s and how often they should be happening. Its safe to say, with the medications, altered diet and stress that my BM’s were all over the place in the first week. I think this is normal but I was keen to get back to a more regular pattern. I think its advisable to aim for your regular movement and not what the internet tells you!16. Diet after surgeryFor the first five days I drank a lot of fresh juices, fruit and veg. I did not eat any bread or red meat. I ate quite a lot of potatoes and rice too. Your aiming for soft stools, not watery or solid. You need volume as well, so try an eat as best you can.Having some other little snacks available if the mood took me was a real nice to have. I have so far avoided anything sweet like cakes, caffine, spicey foods.17. RestWeek one - I literally did not get out of bed apart from trips to the bathroom. I found lying on my left hand side the most comfortable.Week two - I made a point of getting on my feet at least once an hour for a few mins, and increased as the week went on. I also started to go out for short walks for about 10 mins and found this really helpful for my mood more than anything.Week three - I feel like I can sit down (all be it on the sofa). I am much more up and about around the house, and have been out for short journeys in the car. I am being very careful not to pick up heavy items or over do it.18. Netflix!I think Netflix may have saved me on boredom and been the perfect distraction! I am an active person with an active mind so I knew resting was going to be difficult. I got stuck into House of Cards and found it the best distraction because I was so absorbed. I also wanted to go and watch the next episode desperately so was forced to relax! (And yes, I did all four seasons in about 10 days!) I am pretty sure resting properly has really helped with my recovery so far.19. Back to workI am fortunately between jobs at the moment so feel I can take the time to get better at my own speed. Personally, I would not want to go back to sitting at a desk, commuting or standing around for at least 14 days.I feel like I could go back today (day 16), but I think I would ended up taking painkillers for swelling.20. ComplicationsReading peoples experiences there are plenty of complications associated with this surgery and I have been, and continue to be worried about all of them. It really is a mind game. I have made the mental decision to listen to my body, and if something doesn’t seem right then I will go and see someone about it rather than fretting about it. If your not confident in the answer you’ve got, go and see someone else.ConclusionFor me personally I had been in excruciating pain for about 6 weeks prior to the surgery. I was incredibly uncomfortable, miserable and stressed. I was very anxious that the pain would be worse post surgery as to be honest, I couldn’t take much more. To put it into context, for the two weeks prior I hadn’t really left the house as the pain from the BM left me with spasms all day long.I read far too much on the internet before hand on the procedure and this really panicked me. The day of the op and two days after were pretty miserable, but the painkillers really helped. I would say the pain I had before the surgery was far worse which is why I feel my experience has been relatively positive so far. I was just grateful to be knocked out for the surgery as I felt utterly drained with it all. I have had some bleeding and mucus discharge, but nothing that has really made me want to dash to A&E. I was also sent home with a weeks work of antibiotics in case of infection which made me feel more reassured. I can imagine if you have troublesome haemorrhoids on and off for a number of years and have got exasperated with them but are generally still working/on your feet, that the pain/enforced recovery could be a real shock. Its really not pleasant and there is no getting away from it. You essentially have an open wound in an unclean place, with muscles that move.Its certainly a type of pain I have never experienced before. I have been in a very fortunate position that I was able to go private. Not only was I seen quickly and feel really supported with numbers to call/information, I also felt I had some control over my surgeon. I did a hell of a lot of research and ended up seeing a very highly regarded specialist in this field. I credit her largely with my recovery so far and confidence in what’s happening. If you have the option, go and find the best you can. Being on Day 16 I am feeling pretty good. I am on no painkillers, I would not say I am in pain in general, but I can certainly feel something there. The BM in the morning is still fairly painful, but manageable. For me it was about day 14 that I felt like things were finally improving properly.For the next few weeks I am going to continue with the laxatives/stool softener as I feel over exertion could set me back if I am not careful. For the future, I think I will now take stool softners at least once a day and be even more vigilant in what I am eating – I really don’t want to have to go through this again! For anyone reading this who is about to have surgery – remain calm and positive. It wouldn’t have been advised to you unless it was really necessary. For anyone out there who is in recovery and having a bad day – hang on in there! Its done now, you are doing the best you can … it will get better! Best wishes to all,Sophie "
"Piles","Hemorrhoidectomy Recovery","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hemorrhoidectomy-recovery-537956","Hi all Yes it's embarrassing. Yes I haven't shared it with my friends, but it felt important to post this seeing as I'd read everything I possibly could for the last 6 months leading up to last Friday. I had my op on Friday. I'm a healthy, 32 yr old woman who was lucky enough to get these piles during pregnancy 2 years ago. I read all the forums and scared myself witless. I was braced for the worst. I was lucky enough to be woken up in recovery by a nurse telling me ""they got All of them, but couldn't remove the anal polyp inside so you'll have to have it done again in 3 months time"". Oh joy! Since the procedure, I've kept on top of the painkillers, I was given codeine to come home with, but have only taken it twice at night. The rest of the time I've taken paracetamol and ibuprofen. I didn't wait for it to hurt, I kept on top of it. Until today anyway. I've been quite lapse today and I've realised I shouldn't have been. I have been taking 15mls of lactulose twice a day. I also got some peppermint oil capsules to help with the trapped wind. On a scale of 1-10 with pain, I'll say I've not been above a 3. Maybe not even a 2. I was expecting to be off the scale of pain after the scary stories I've read. I had my first BM yesterday. I had prepared myself. Got a stool to put my feet on. Used EMLA cream on the area about 30 mins before. Didn't run a bath (that was a mistake). I was conscious of not straining. I was scared, but it was more watery than I expected. Even though I'd eaten all bran, veggies, smoothies with flax seeds and chia seeds. It didn't hurt as it was happening. It hurt after. Hurt as much as an 8 on the scale. More stinging than agony though. I ran a bath, sat in it for 20 mins and then I was ok. I've slept quite a lot. I've not really been able to sit for longer than 20 minutes, but the lack of pain has been surprising. As I'm typing this, my pain is 0. When I move it feels like it did when I'd not pushed my bum grapes back up after a poo. Hope this is making sense! My bum has been bleeding. Not loads, more weeping. Ive made sure that I've wiped it down with some cotton wool and water before bed. I've had a shower every day. I wonder how long this will last. I'll keep you all updated, as I'm waiting for my next BM which should be tomorrow. For those of you waiting to have this done, don't be too scared. I very nearly cancelled this after what I had read online. I read people saying they were in chronic pain for 5 days after, unbearable pain for 5 days after that. I've been able to sleep, move about etc. I wouldn't be able to go to work, I wouldn't be able to ride a bike, but it's nowhere near how awful I had expected. "
"Piles","Haemorrhoids","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/haemorrhoids-632515","I was diagnosed grade 2 Hemorrhoids only about a months back. I never had any complaint earlier except that I had been having constipation/ delayed emptying since long. I went to the surgeon when I felt some discomfort. He said that I had grade 2 Hemorrhoids internal (no bleeding) at the moment. In view of my advanced age neither I consider any surgery nor the Surgeon felt so. However he prescribed use of Anusol Plus Ointment (Pramoxine Hydrochloride and 0.5 % Zinc Sulfate Monohydrate) or Tronolane (Pramoxine Hydrochloride) and then later injection also. I do not plan to have injection also. My discomfort finished within 2-3 days after using Anusol plus ointment and since then there is no problem/ no discomfort. I like to ask views of other Haemorrhoids patients on following points:1. Should I keep using this ointment without any break even if I do not feel any discomfort? I just apprehend recurrence of problem if I stop using this ointment.2. Would it be better to use the Ointment with lesser frequency?3. Being a steroid, can its prolonged use create any other problems pertaining to Eye problems (early Glaucoma and early AMD) etc. "
"Piles","When will the bleeding end? ","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/when-will-the-bleeding-end--632417","I'm 44 fairly fit and I have a good diet. Following years of lifting weights I had several months of on/off bleeding a year or so ago, and tried all sorts or creams and potions to stop it. Had camera up there to see what was going on, and nothing but soreness was visible. Had an exploratory procedure under general anaesthetic and all that was found was two thrombosed veins and a healed tear. The bleeding continued, but finally stopped last summer. 24 blissful weeks went by, and not a drop of blood, until I had to do some heavy lifting, and it all started again.Its been over a month now, and I've only had 4 none consecutive days where I've not bled. It doesn't seem to follow any pattern, if the stools are soft I bleed, if they're hard I bleed. I don't strain (well, not very much, I really try not to) and the blood keeps coming.I've tried anusol and another clear gel, (but can't remember the name right now. Sericot or something similar.) neither had much affect at all. My doc has told me to stop using them now as they're not working, and explained that it's probably just a weak vein. She's referred me back to the hospital, which is both good and bad. After reading all the horror stories about surgical options, I'm scared to death. I'm finding this is really affecting my life. My mood is super low and I just can't stop thinking and worrying about it. It doesn't hurt, and there's probably only a thimble full of blood each BM, but I can't stop it. The thought of the humiliation of having to tell my HR rep at work if I need time off for an op, or having to sit on a special cushion just fills me with dread. I feel like a zombie. Is there anything I can do to break this cycle? I want my life back. "
"Piles","Hemorrhoidectomy Update: Major blood loss. ","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hemorrhoidectomy-update-major-blood-loss--632222","So I have a open thread on here describing my recovery but decided this issue deserves a new topic. Please read my original post for all the prior details. On Sunday night (9 days post op) something extremely scary happened. Around 5:00 pm after eating a full meal and feeling good I decided to try to have a BM, so after a little bit of straining and no result I decided to go in the tub like I normally do. After about 5 mins in the tub I felt a heavy urge to have a BM so I jumped out of the tub and onto the toilet and had (what I thought was) a good bowel movement but with more blood than normal. I went back in the tub, after about 5 mins I noticed the water turning red from blood so I drained the tub, turned on the shower and went back on the toilet and had another bowel movement with nothing but blood. I began to get light headed and not feel good so I had my wife call somebody to drive me to the ER. I began to feel nauseous and faint and shaking uncontrollably so she called the ambulance. My blood pressure was 52 over 33, my insides were rapidly filling with blood. I got to the ER and told them that I had to release everything that built up inside me and I fainted, I had lost 4 units of blood and had to be transfused. After 3 hours of laying nearly upside down and having unit after unit of blood pumped into me, nearly dying twice from blood loss and having blood just leaking out of me and up my back they took me for surgery. Turns out that one of the stitches from an internal hemorrhoid that was remove had opened up and was pumping massive amounts of blood into my colon. The “BMs” I was having were nothing but clotted blood. This was a horribly traumatic experience, by far the worst experience of my life, I was literally dying and was too weak to do anything about it. I just remember laying there and thinking “I’m gonna die” and I was ok with it at that point. Needless to say I am alive and well.I am home now and everything is ok physically. My surgeon came in before I was discharged and told me that what happened was very rare especially this late into the recovery process and that there is very little info on it because it is such a rare thing, so I decided to write this so people can be informed.

I recently took very sick and the pressure, as well as causing me severe abdomen pain has also caused a bad dose of Hemorrhoids. At first there appeared to be two small pea shaped lumps inside my rectum (I had once had a Hemorrhoid 3 years ago that went away itself after a few days of using a cream), along with a far larger lump that protruded out my anus and had a purple tinge to it. I went to the pharmacy and was given anti inflammatory and a cream to apply. After three days of extreme pain I woke up to the shock of the bed being absolutely covered in blood. The plus point was the pain was almost gone and the huge lump had dissipated. I showered and cleaned myself and noticed a red small ball lump in the shower which I assume was a clot?. I still feel the two smaller lumps and have to wear pads due to bleeding (not much, usually just a small few drops) but enough I’d worry would soak through my clothes and cause embarrassment. That was two days ago and there is still some blood. The other two that are further up only cause me pain during a bm and wiping. Due to work this last week when it started I’ve barely had a minute off my feet and when I have I’ve been sitting on long haul flights, and not always been able to apply the cream. The questions I have that I am hoping someone can answer is 1) is it normal for the bleeding from the large burst one to still be there 3 days later? If so how much longer can I expect it? And 2) now I’m back to a more normal life, what’s the chances of the other two going away on their own with otc creams, baths and some essential oils? And again if so, how long usually? I feel I’m too young to be plagued with this and it’s only because of being so sick recently. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. "

Suppositories seemed to clear this up, but the bloody stool mucus has come back, and now there's pain too. My reading around the subject tells me that external haemorrhoids hurt, but internal ones don't. But then some places say they do. I'm really confused by this, so my question to you all is this:What type of pain do internal rhoids cause? What I'm getting is internal, dull, inconstant aching, very localised to an inside point. It's almost like the ache of a pulled muscle but all in one small spot. It comes and goes, made worse by sitting which I assume is due to pressure on it. It's combining with lower back pain too. Everyone else seems to be talking about burning pains and tearing pains. I am going to try and get an appointment next week to talk about potentially more serious causes because there is a history of colon cancer in my family, but of course this has come to a head when the surgeries aren't open, and now I get to spend Christmas weekend and holidays mostly just terrified of what's going on.

"Piles","Inquiry into Scar Tissue after Hemorrhoidectomy Complications","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/inquiry-into-scar-tissue-after-hemorrhoidectomy-complications-519836","I had the most excruciating expirience with an impaction that began with unholy pain, pouring sweat, vomiting, and screaming. It lasted about 30 min. of me manually evacuating the problem followed by me crying in an Epsom salt bath. I had a hemorrhoidectomy about three weeks ago (never have this surgery at all costs) and I will regret it for the rest of my life. The surgeon removed two internal hemorrhoids, but the sutures I guess left this giant skin tag after the surgery. The next week took a turn for the worse when my internal sutures ruptured and I began hemorrhaging an emense amount of blood. Still have no idea how this happened as I followed all post-opp procedures to the letter. After a few units of blood and a bit of emergency surgery I was released the next morning. Thankfully this surgeon removed that large skin tag the first one left behind which caused a lot of discomfort So the whole cycle of pain began again and I reassumed the regiment of stool softeners, Percocet, regular sitz baths, controlled dieting, and constant ice packs. All I wanted was just a mildly annoying internal hemorrhoid that would not go away gone and I'm left with purple, unsilghtly anus with stiching that of Frankenstein. A week after the hemeroage scare things were getting better. The blood and mucal discharge had subsided and I was finally able to stop wearing menstrual pad (being a man I first had to figure out how to properly put these on and my heart goes out to women) but the pain was still crippling so I continued with the pain killers. I of course ran out a couple of days and had thought nothing of it since I previously had a few yet painful but successful bowel movements. This was a terrible lapse of judgment. I had no idea what the hell was going on when I went to use the bathroom. The pain was instant and that pressure on the sphincter was as if I was passing a bowling ball. After a bit of pushing and screaming agony I called my GI's office in a panic to inquire what was happening and the nurse told me I most likely had an impaction. Thankfully I had a hot Epsom salt bath prepared as is normal following a BM after this procedure because jumping in it was the only brief relief that gave me the constitution to talk to the nurse. She said this one is probably quite severe and my pre existing swelling made matters worse. She instructed me to find any lubricant within reach as I was home alone (all I had was polysporin) and worked me through manually removing the impaction little by little. Once the initial impaction was removed everything else behind it came flying out. It was such an amazing relief but left my anus sore and swollen as if I just came out of surgery. The nurse calmed me down a bit and told me to stay in the tub for a while then follow the usual cleaning and application of a steroid ointment for the inherent damage that had been done. When I was finally able to clean myself and the mess to the best of my ability I crawled to my bed unable to move. I called my sister who thankfully is a nurse and she promptly rushed over to my aid. After preparing an ice pack, and a couple Xanax she monitored my minor bleeding until it finally stopped. So I'm writing this two days after the whole ordeal as I'm finally able to sit up again and I apologize for the long story but I just had to get this horrible expirience out somewhere. I'm back on the stool softeners, sitz baths, Proctozone ointment (which is just a prescription hydrocortisone cream), dieting, and regular ice packs. No more with the pain medication though, I don't care how bad it hurts now I will never go through that again. I'm in constant panic that all this may have damaged my anus so much so that I will develop stenosis and be reliant on stool softeners for life or worse undergo more surgery. I'm only 22, and I'm also afraid my sex life is over or that my partner of five, going on six years, will find my destroyed anus grotesque. He's currently been out of town on business for the month this has all happened but after the second surgery he promptly flew home to stay with me a few days before he had to go back. He's been extremly comforting and supportive of this whole thing, checking on me constantly everyday since the first procedure which was just supposed to be a simple outpatient procedure. He's very understanding of all that's had been done to me and has never been ""grossed out"" by any of the details; only concerned for my comfort and recovery. He has yet to actually see the exent of the damage thought. But I don't know if it's just my insecurities of being a hideous mess who dies sad and alone eating at me but I'm just so afraid my condition may drive him away somehow. Is there anything else I can do other than what I'm already doing to prevent/heal the scar tissue or is my fear of stenosis just unneeded panic? My clinic says not to worry but they said the same after my initial procedure leading me to distrust them. I'm kind of at my wits end here and any advice or wisdom is greatly appreciated.

"Piles","Hemorrhoidectomy- will it ever gets better?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hemorrhoidectomy-will-it-ever-gets-better--625386","Hi everyone! Thank you everyone for sharing your experience as they helped me getting through this recovery tremendously! Every body is a little different, reaction to the traumatic surgery, pain level, bowel movement BM, recovery time. I hope in sharing my journey, it’ll reassure someone that there is light at the end of the tunnel! I’m a very healthy woman in her 30’s with an active life style and balance diet habit. I exercise 2-3 times a week consistently ever since university days. Less than handful of times of constipation in my entire life. My profession also requires me to be on my feet most of the time. I’m always moving. I would never ever imagine myself needed this surgery. So what I didn’t know was I have a family history of weaker veins and development of hemorrhoids. So what happened was I gave birth to my two beautiful children. During all the pushing, my anus basically inflated into a golf ball. It subsided after, but ever since the area has loser skin and weaker veins which leads to hemorrhoids right at the opening and extended to internal, circumferential all around. Every time when they flared up, I’d be in extreme pain on bed rest for a week! So finally my GP told me to consider this surgery since after 6 years, they’re not reducing and I’m not having any more babies. So I did it. The surgeon removed 4 decent sized external/internal hemorrhoids. Not sure if they considered a protruding ones becase the base is external and extending internally. It was very extensive that the surgeon reluctantly left a few anterior and posterior skin tags. She explained that if she removes all, my skin will be too tight and my opening will be way too small for passing stool. Even going through this traumatic surgery, I’m not going to have a baby bum. Oh well. The recovery of this surgery is longer than most surgery. I read a few people recovered within a week- wow. And some, 6 weeks. It all depends on the location and the size of the hemorrhoids +\- fissures. My recovery time is about average I would say. Not as bad as some people posted here and worse than some super-human-1&2-weeks recovery. I would say the recovery is like the following:First 5 days : Discomfort, and worsen after BM after day 3 (because of the local anesthetic freezing- save my life!! Only needed tramadol for pain, sometimes Advil to top up)Second 5 days : Excruciating pain and bed ridden (spams after each BM, almost like contraction during labour that lasts 1-2 hours and needed Percoset —and still painful with meds )Third 5 days : Tolerable pain ( 50% better, tramadol was enough to control the pain)Fourth 5 days : Discomfort most of the time and tolerable pain after BM ( 60-70% better; only taking tramadol after each BM; able to get out of the house briefly; drainage stopped; and still off work)Fifth 5 days: Pain free!! Slight discomfort after BM but no painkiller needed. There are a few small lumps still. They were hard, but getting softer and smaller each day. Slight tenderness when pressure applied to lumps. I massage some hemorrhoid gel to help reduce them. So the pain will pass!!! It’s like a miracle that the pain is gone over night out of nowhere!! What helped me to recover:1) right before going into the operating room before surgery, Ask and REMIND your surgeon to give you a good amount LOCAL ANESTHETIC freezing to the area. It will numb your area for a good 72 hours and slowly subside after. From what I read, this save me for A LOT of grief. My pain level for the first night was 1. Second/third day maybe 2. My first BM was easy and pain free because the area was completely numbed. This is MAGIC and you need it!2) Before surgery 1-2 day, eat clean. The night before surgery, use an enema to clean your system 3) Diet: first 5 days-soft food/lots of soup/stool bulking food like apple and pear and banana. After 5 days - slowly increase texture of food and the amount of food. If BM is too painful, stop eating high texture food. Fruits are great -fine fibre vs coarse. 3) Water- as you eat more, drink more. 4) Stool softener- take it religiously. VOID CONSTIPATION AT ALL COST. Do not take laxative regularly though becase your body will depend on it and it might give you diarrhea. Stool softener will not build dependency. But, if you have constipation, then take laxative as a one time thing. 5) Squirt bottle for cleaning after BM. Isn’t he early days, even baby wipes hurt. Squirt bottle works so well!!6)Sitz bath after BM and whenever pain elevated. I used a baby tub inside my bath tub. Some days, I lived in the bath tub. 7) Pain meds: some opioid pain meds can cause constipation, BUT take them still, especially the first 10 days. Take them when the pain is level 3-4. Do not wait until 8-9 as it doesn’t work as well at that point. Drink a lot of water and take stool softener to compensate the side effect. Adjust your pain meds intake according to your pain level. You may not need to take Percocet around the clock. So I’m 3 weeks post surgery now, pain is gone. But if I eat something more textures like seeds and nuts, my BM will hurt. At 2 weeks mark, I was so worried about irregular BM and strong urgency to go. But now, it’s better 90%. Once a day in the morning. Still taking stool softener- maybe forever! I’m trying to do some mild exercise today. Over the last 3 weeks, I lost 10 lbs and my muscle definition. I’m just happy that I’m returning to (almost) normal! Hope this give you hope in your recovery!! Good luck!! "

"Piles","14 days post op. ","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/14-days-post-op--623772","Figured I'd post some of my experience as well as ask a few questions. First question: how long did your bms cause burning after the fact. I still have to get to the toilet with only moments to spare, and I have to sit in the tub after for relief from the burning lava feeling in my hole. I can't wait for this to end. Next questions: how long did you experience anal leakage? Experience. Day 1-2 I had minimum pain. I barely took pain meds, really only took Motrin to help with swelling and stools softners. I had more anxiety about when the pain would come than anything else. Day 3. Stil minimum pain but had my first bowel movement. Wasn't as bad as I expected but that's probably because I was still numb from the local anesethic they used. Day 4-5. Pain was unbearable but I stayed on top of my narcotic to make sure that I didn't feel like death. Slept most of the day and night. Occasionally over slept. (Make sure you set an alarm for meds or you'll regret it. In the evening I felt the urge to go to the barroom but every time I sat down on the toilet nothing happened. So I spent 3 hours goin back and forth to see if it would happen. Frozen hot dogs in a zip lock bag made the perfect ice PAC for my pain though! Day 6. Still no poop. Called doctor and was told to take a dose of milk of magnesia. If it didn't work in 6 hours, take a second dose. It didn't help. At all. Literally nothing. Didn't have much pain from my but, but mostly pain from feeling pressure of needing to poop but not being able to. I didn't take any narcotics because I was constipated enough. So I took Motrin. I felt weak and tired. Couldn't keep my eyes open most of the day even without meds. Day 7. Still no bm called doctor again was told to double my stopper softners and take miralax. And if nothing to call back. Still only took Motrin and no bm. By this point I was panicked my the though of pooping or needing to go to the hospital. So my anxiety got to an outrageous point. That night doctor told me to take magnisum citrate to wash my bowels. If that didn't work I was to do an enema the next day. I had gas the entire night but no poop. At this point I was barely eating for fear of becoming impacted. And I was only eating crackers, water and occasionally a few pieces of bread. Day 8. Woke up with a lot of pressure to poop. I squatted on the toilet, and ended up having to push out a hard stool that seemed to be a blockage. Didn't poop for 6 hours after that. But I was in pain for a majority of the day. Around dinner time I got diarrhea, it went on well into the night. Still no appetite. The burning pain after bm was almost unbearable. Day 9. Thanksgiving. I didn't sleep well for fear I would soil myself in my sleep. I had 4 bms before noon. I hate a bowl of soup and that was it. Day 10. Still light appetite. But completely off narcotics. Felt like I might see the light st the end of the tunnel. From this point on it has gotten better. Day 11-14. I have still not gained my appetite back, though I'm sure it's more mental than physical. I have a panic attack every time I feel a bm coming, and I only eat 1 small meal a day with stool softners and water the rest of the day. For fear or big bowel movements. I have what I think is a small external hemmrhiod that pooped up Day 12. I've been using witch hazel multiple times a day to help it shrink completely. As well as hemrhiod cream for the ocassional itchy. I have developed a vaginal bacterial infection from the anal leakage. (Yes. I know gross. But just beware it can happen). The leakage and burning after poop are pretty much the only thing left I'm dealing with. I'd say I'm about 85% back to normal. A bonus is I've lost 15 pounds since surgery. I hope this is my new normal. I miss food. And I miss not having to get in warm water after a bowel movement. It's very time consuming.Other than that I'm back to my normal day to day. I've cleaned my house played with my kids and I'm back driving. So I'm mostly back to my normal routine (3 young kids at home.) Just wanted to share my experience. Hope someone can answer my questions. Or walk away with some tips. "

"Piles","Let me tell you a hemorrhoid story","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/let-me-tell-you-a-hemorrhoid-story-617356","Hi kids. I'm currently 24 days out from a single grade 2 hemorrhoid banding, and since I am sitting on a heating pad with Extra Strength Tylenol coursing through my veins for what seems like the millionth day in a row, I thought I'd take the time out to tell my story on how something that seems not too difficult a problem to take care of has turned into one of the hardest things I've ever gone through.First things first. When I was a little girl, a long time ago, I developed an anal fissure which hurt a lot. In response to that, I started holding my BMs resulting in an impaction I had to go to the hospital to have taken care of. I remember being very frightened, embarrassed by the procedure, scared of being left by my family at night and humiliated when nurses laughed at me when I finally passed a huge stool.So I've always had a little love affair with crappy anal problems. I guess it's just one of my ""things"".Anything that happens to me these days when I have to go see my colo-rectal surgeon brings back bad childhood memories.Anyway, 3 years ago I suffered from 3 enlarged internal hemorrhoids and a ring of ""impressive"" external hemmies. By the time I finally broke down and went to see my doctor (I had never been to see her before this), the external hemms had resolved. But I had to get the internals banded in 3 sessions set 2-3 weeks apart. It wasn't a fun process by any means, but it did the trick. I learned that the process is not even almost ""painless"" or ""quick"". But I was in so much discomfort I was happy to have a way to fix it.I felt better but I always lived with the ""what if it happens again"" fear in the back of my head. Most days I thought--that was weird--It'll never happen again.You know what I am going to say next now, don't you?Back in August, my brother-in-law passed away. It was a very stressful time for me and my sisters. I'm a type A personality, and I tried to shoulder a lot of responsibility for getting things taken care of then. Meanwhile, I ignore my grief. Cue the non-stop upset stomach and diarrhea that took place for weeks. Cue the unfortunate familiar unrest in my butt that felt like someone lit a match in there or like I was carrying a bowling ball down there or like someone kicked me in my butt hard.I knew my hemorrhoids were flaring. I called my doctor right away--next available appointment was 5 weeks away. So every night until the appointment I was in pain.Internal hemorrhoids can absolutely hurt. Mine did. Every night. I ended up in the ER one time because my bottom was throbbing. When the doctor did a digital rectal exam, I nearly passed out. It was worth it though, because she prescribed pain killers for me.So finally I get to my appointment with my surgeon. Everyone who knows what is going on with me is happy the day has finally arrived. I've been in agony for weeks.My doctor looks up my posterior, informs me I have one grade 2 internal hemorrhoid that is the cause of all this grief and did I want it banded? YES, I said, YES I DO. I heard her tell her assistant that there wasn't much tissue to grab on to, but 2 seconds later I am up and getting dressed and thanking her for helping me.The next couple of days I deal with the pain of a fresh banding...the constant urge to go to the bathroom when there isn't really anything there. Bonus--I catch my daughter's cold and proceed to hack at night like a crazy person. If you don't already know, every time you cough or sneeze, you feel it in your butt. It was basic agony. But still, I thought, I am going to be okay soon.2 weeks after the banding I went back to have the physician assistant look again because I am having so much pain, especially at night. The pain causes me anxiety which causes diarrhea. I am so stressed I can't get on top of this. The PA looks inside and says the hemmie and band are gone, but that she can see it was banded in a place close to the pain sensors in my anal canal and no wonder it hurts so much. She also tells me my rectum is red and inflamed from the diarrhea. She tells me my recovery is going to take at least 2-3 more weeks and to go home and relax with a glass of red wine. I am so relieved, I hug her. I should have asked for pain relief, but I didn't.Went home that night, trying to relax, and our dog (fur baby) proceeds to have a massive seizure. Her first one. We rush her to the vet and they're like, maybe it'll be only one. I have diarrhea from all the stress at the vet office. We go home, dog has another massive seizure in the middle of the night.Husband and I are stressed to our maximums. Dog gets seizure medicine the next day and is better.I am still completely stressed out. My butt still hurts 24 days after my banding. I have anxiety from knowing I am going to be in pain every day. I am sad because I don't think I am ever going to feel normal again.My doctor assures me I will be fine in a few weeks. Til then, take Advil and Tylenol. Advil doesn't touch the pain, Tylenol is better. I am trying my best to take it easy and get better. I have never had to recover from any procedure really before. I am not good at it, apparently.If you've read this, thank you. This board has been somewhat of a lifesaver for me these past few months. Everyone's experiences have been helpful to me.I am here to sayInternal hemorrhoids CAN hurt.Rubber band ligation CAN be painful.Some people don't bounce back after one or 2 days. or even 2 weeks.Banding a hemorrhoid near the pain sensors might not hurt right at banding but will flare up hours later when it's too late to adjust the band.I am hoping like crazy I feel better soon. This whole enchilada has made me somewhat depressed.Hugs to you all, fellow hemorrhoids sufferers.We are a brave bunch, that's for darn sure.Just one stupid little hemorrhoid."

My experience from the 1st one prepared me for #2. I knew it would hurt for about a week or even two. On day 6 it is the worst!! I'm not sure what it was but it felt like there was a monster haemorrhoid trying to get out. (Same as with first banding) Only this time I didn't freak out because I knew the time table. You can be pretty sure that your doctor who may tell you that some patients say they went right back to work that afternoon, has never had this procedure. That was my big takeaway! They don't know. On day 6, I did sitz baths, ice. For the previous 5 days, I took some homeopathic remedies like Arnica (pain and brusing) and Hypernicum (nerve pain) and it was helpful. But on day six I felt desperate. Same as day 6 on the first banding. I eventually took 4 Advil and went to sleep deciding that it would all fall back into place when I woke up the next morning and it did. Just like last time!! I have one more banding to go and THE END! I felt a good difference only having 2 hemorrhoids instead of 3 and now I can feel the difference only having 1 left. Yes, it was painful. No, the doctor had no idea what it was like. On Wednesday April 27th it will be 2 weeks and I am much better and feel like I will be even better on Wed. Don't freak out - I did for the first one - because it does get better in time. However, do not believe your Dr. who may tell you some of her/his patients go back to work that afternoon. The next day I could barely sit in my car to take my dog to my friends for a play date and once I drove there I was wishing hard that my car would just fly back to my garage with me in it. I'm talking about a 10 minute drive each way!! I have not discussed my hemorrhoids with anyone but my partner, my acupuncurist, and my most magical healer friend. It's awkward to talk.If someone talks about hemorrhoids (hardly ever happens) I'd be happy to chime in. Do you?"

Hope you're doing well :-)My name's Michelle and welcome to My Hemorrhoidectomy Journey posts. This is part 8. Please feel free to read parts 1-7 of My Hemorrhoidectomy Journey to see what has led me up to this point, how and why. Any questions/comments/feedback is greatly appreciated - thanks in advance as always! By the way, today is May 19, 2017, but since it's still early, I'll only be updating up to yesterday, but doing it more as to finish with the 3 wk mark post surgery. And here we go...POD 18:Monday, May 15, 2017.Today was not too bad in general. That or I'm probably getting too used to the pain. I woke up with the usual tolerable pain. I took my regular levothyroxine med in the morn. Kids left to school. I had cereal for breakfast. Afterwards, after husband had left to work, I was enjoying for a bit the gifts I had received from husband, kids & a friend during Mother's Day Week. Had a yogurt for a snack and took a stool softener. Soon, afterwards, around 1pm, I had first bm of day. It hurt, but surprisingly, it was not as painful as usually I expect it to be and not as intense, but instead quite easy compared to the many other bm times. Still had some bleeding as usual with bm, and also discharge. Cleaned up then washed up, and went to bed as I knew the usual afterburn pain wouldn't delay.Afterburn pain came and stayed for several hours, but like I mentioned earlier in this post, maybe I'm just getting too used to the afterburn pain, because it didn't bother me as much as other days. It was still too painful to walk, but I don't know how to explain that although it was bad, it didn't feel extreme as it usually feels after bm. In addition, I just tried to distract myself from the bad pain. I was searching online for food caterer for my kids' birthday party & someone who will let us rent tables & bounce house. In the middle of my pain, I managed to find the perfect party package deal. Found people on Craigslist who do catering & rent bounce houses, tables & chairs. They even help with serving food to guests. And the clowns for entertaining with games & facepainting has already been reserved weeks ago. At the rate I'm going with recovery, those reservations are ideal for the upcoming party and will be less stress for us. Back to topic, lol, the bad pain continued throughout the rest of the day. I eventually took a tramadol along with stool softener. Husband cooked up some chicken, boiling it in water, than shredding it to small pcs and making a veggie salad to add to the side. So, I had some chicken with veggie salad plus a few crackers and a peach for dinner.Pain became tolerable at night time and I eventually fell asleep around midnight.POD 19:Tuesday, May 16, 2017.For the first time, I can actually say that pain has been low today. I felt ok for the most part almost all day. Woke up, took levothyroxine med, kids went to bed, then had a sweet bread with milk. Around noon, I had a yogurt snack again with a fruit and then stool softener. Afterwards, had a late lunch of shredded chicken and veggie salad again. Low-pain time didn't last forever. Right before dinner, I had first bm around 6:30. Much painful than yesterday. It was somewhat difficult to pass as well. And the afterpain felt worse than yesterday, too. No fun, but oh well, after bathroom, went to bed, and pain gradually increased. I was hoping it was going to be the same as yesterday, but no, it was gradually getting worse. Had delicious lentils for dinner around 7:30pm. I eventually took a hydrocone with a stool softener about an hr later, but as the night progressed, pain became more unbearable. If I tried to walk, the pain attacks/spasms would come on, so stayed in bed. Husband gave me icy wet towel. It helped a bit, but little relief didn't last long. I eventually took another hydrocone about 1 hr later. Finally, around 1am, pain finally started to calm down. But lingering pain still kept me up despite all the drowsiness I felt from the pain pills. I eventually fell asleep around 3:30am.POD 20:Wednesday, May 17, 2017.Today seemed to be the most comfortable, Low-pain day that I've had since surgery day. Woke up around 7am, took thyroid med, kids left to school, had some cereal for breakfast, had yogurt and peach for snack with stool softener, then for lunch, had lentils & crackers. I managed to fall asleep around 1:30pm and didn't wake up until about 6:30pm. During that time, kids had come home from school & husband had gone to buy a go cart for the kiddos. Wow, lol. Kids love it, that's for sure! So, afterwards, while husband was busy working on the yard outside, I felt comfortable enough to do a couple things without him noticing, lol. I managed to fix up some laundry. My oldest one, Landen, was helping with taking clothes in & out of washer/dryer, and I folded clothes putting everything where it belongs. I had more delicious lentils for dinner. No pain pills since the night before which was a first since surgery day I think. By the time it was bedtime, I figured that I was probably constipated since there had not been a bm all day, but I didn't really care at the moment since I felt pretty comfortable and mobile for once despite the low pain which didn't bother me at all. I managed to fall asleep around 11am which is pretty early compared to most days since surgery day.POD 21:Thursday, May 18, 2017.So, today marks 3 wks since surgery day and I honestly thought before today that the worse was behind me and somehow I believed that it was really finally getting better. OMG, was I wrong. I realized this morning that that is still not the case. Today has been the worse yet. What I didn't pay for yesterday, I greatly paid for it today. Not to mention very painfully...So, I woke up around 7am as usual, took thyroid med, and soon kids went to school. I had a sweet bread with some milk for breakfast. Soon afterwards around 9am, had first bm of the day. OMG...the worse yet. So difficult to pass, so intense and very, very painful. Not sure how long it took, but I know several minutes had passed. I was shaking during and afterwards as well. The blood along with that bm was a lot along with several blood clots and some discharge. I was crying. I was in lots of pain and I also felt upset because I felt like I had taken a couple steps back. After cleaning up and washing up, I went back to bed, still in tears and in obvious pain. My husband was so sweet as usual, trying to comfort me before leaving to work, telling me to try to be patient and to give it time. He soon left to go to work. Within the next 3 hrs, I had 2 more dreadful bms. Those were not as difficult & intense, but still very painful & each still left me a bit shaken. Well, at least this month's period is over with, but anyways, you can imagine the rest of the day. In lots of pain and in bed. Honestly, I didn't even bother to take pain pills since I l ready know based on experience that they don't help when it comes to extreme pain. Only took a stool softener around noon. But amazingly, I managed to fall asleep for a couple hrs during afternoon. By nighttime, pain was at tolerable level. Husband gave me veggie soup for dinner along with some crackers. Around 9pm, after 48hrs of no pain pills, I took a hydrocone with stool softener hoping it will help me fall asleep easier & maybe bring pain down lower. It eventually brought pain down to low level, but couldn't sleep, and eventually fell asleep around 2:30am. Finally end of POD 21 ***A few side notes...When I wash up down there, it's still with either with warm water bottle or hot shower. I have to admit though that for some reason, hot/warm water is not that alleviating anymore, but instead stinging. But too chicken to shower with cold water, lol, so still wash up anyway to help keep clean, and still am using baby wipes as well, but to help cope with pain, I just do the cold wet towel whenever pain does get really bad.When pain has been low, I've been kind of challenging myself in the aspect of starting to sit for a few min at a time on my rectum. It is still painful, but Idk, just testing myself to see how much I can take.Husband still taking care of most things & prefers to keep it that way until I'm completely ok. Wow. I often think it's too much for him, but he somehow handles it all with always a positive attitude. So grateful & very proud of him Dr appt is next Fri. Wonder what Dr will say. I also wonder how I'll be that night because concert is that night. Probably will need doughnut thing to get through concert. I don't intend to miss it..I am so eager to get out as it has been over 3 wks already since I have been out of this house! No fun at all Will post part 9 either this wknd or sometime next wk. Anyways questions, feedback, advice, comments is always greatly appreciated - thanks in advance - take care and God Bless "
"Piles","Hemmroids/fissures cronic","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hemmroids-fissures-cronic-615119","Hi friend! My name is Kimberly. Age 48 I too have numerous issues in this department and wanted to encourage you and any other readers. My issues include hemmroids internal, external, fissures, tight sphintor muscle from birth. Oh yeah! It's been fun! Have suffered many flair ups over the years And after hours of research have learned a few things. First it can be a very discouraging, isolating experince to deal with pain like this. Second. There is hope. Most recent flair up was six weeks ago. I honestly had never experienced pain like that other than child birth. I have three kids- all natural so I have experienced pain. Come to find out along with the fissures, and sohintor issues I was thrombosed at one point. With so many issues it's hard to know where to start and I swear I tried everything. It's quite a dance to find what works sometimes. My last flair up was due to antibiotics that caused constipation. (Side note) I haven't used antibiotics or been sick in at least 5 years because I have built up my immune system using viteimins.) Tip one stay healthy so you never need to use antibiotics. They don't help the situation. ( UTI - off vitamins for a few days. Never again!) When your fissure is raw don't put anything on it except vasoline when you are going. Sometimes we over stimulate the situation by putting too much down there. My pain was bad enough that nothing got me through but the Percocet and flexril that my husband was prescribed for surgery. That is hard to get if you are not a surgery patient. Don't know what I would have done without it. Anyway it took about 6 weeks to begin to heal. If you have hemmroids and you thrombose believe it or not apple cider vinigar reduces hemmroids in about thirty minutes. ( research) don't over due but very helpful. Soaked cotton ball on the rear for thirty minutes.Aloe Vera juice from the gel of the plant. They sell this in Walmart next to the medimucil. Wonderful natural stool softener. Don't use the ones that aren't pure or talk about using the leaves. That has a laxitive affect witch can inflame an already inflamed situation. Anyway it also has amazing healing properties and drinking this 4 ounces twice a day is what finally started the healing process for me. Healing natural oil. ( it's really called this.) one of the best products I have ever found. Order online) used the hemmroids oil until I felt the fissure starting to heal then used fissure as well. Used too much right after I broke open and again caused painful irritation. Fissures are cuts. Anything you put on an open cut will sting. For hours! Wait until it has begun to heal. Learned that the hard way. Meanwhile went to the collectal surgeon to confirm my situation. At its worst I just wanted to schedule surgery. .... she confirmed everything. My own research paid off. She thought I was medical person! I'm a teacher. 😄 Am a surgery candidate but two days Prior was starting to have some turn around with the aloe. Now what? Decided not to give up too soon and she prescribed nefedipine. Ok I thought maybe this is a good option. Failed to research it before I used it. Side effect- constipation. This is what caused the whole problem in the first place. Sure enough. First application! Won't be using that again. Long story short this is what works:Heavy pain killers when necessary. Opiates constipate so only use as necessary, but when you need it you need it. Oxycodone worked well for me. ( percacet)Aloe Vera juice 8 ounces a day - 4 in the am and 4 in the pm. I will never get off of it again. You can use stool softer at its worst as well. Really helps. Aloe works the best with no side effects.Apple cider when thrombose was acute.Lots of water. This is my nemesis. My struggle. Just forget. Learning not too!More ruffage. Salads really? When I do, I'm better. When I don't I'm not. That simple. Quick sits bath after going. I used the bath tub. 15 min tops. Helps. When I was coming down from the pain killers I added three Advil. Helps with inflimation. As I got better 3 Advil and 4 tynol. I know, I'm worried about my liver too but its only tempory. I'm ok with that. Note: without diet or water intake change you are going to have reacurring problems. Wish I'd figured this out sooner. Slow learner I guess. Time: These injuries take special care, time, and patience. Learned this the hard way too. Healing natural oil a bit further in the healing process. Awesome products. Desiitin ( zinc oxide ) can be soothing as well. Remember don't overdo. ((learned this the hard way.) too much stimulation down there can be too much. If you feel an increase of pain with any of this, hop in the tub and rinse off. Know you are not alone! Together we can get through it and with some changes, come out on the other side. End note: I am a surgery canidate for several things but after a lot of research and reading a lot difficult stories, have decided that I want to try and control my issues by getting healthy. Always the better route. With surgery can come other complications, and I think I've been through enough. Maybe you have too. I'm coming out on the other side and finally feel hope again. Hang in there. We are walking together and together we can get better and stay well. Love to stay in touch with all who would like!"
"Piles","Hemorrhoidectomy (external/5 weeks post op) Experience/Rant and Questions","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hemorrhoidectomy-external-5-weeks-post-op-experience-rant-and-questions-602995","After noticing a very small pea sized bump on a Friday evening, which grew to a thumb sized moderately painful lump by Saturday evening, I immediately went to an urgent care that was open on a Sunday morning. The only reason I didn't go saturday was because I had to go to an out of town wedding. After reading a lot on it, I was hopeful that something could be done if caught fast enough. The doctor that day did nothing but send me to a specialist.An appointment was made for the following week, at which time the doctor examined me and said I was a ""tough man,"" then recommended surgery. (I should have known it was going to be all downhill from there.) I asked the normal questions about healing time (was told a weeked to a week and a half out of work and about a month to be completely normal again), pain levels, chance of it getting better (since it had been regressing slowly), and was told that the surgery gets a bad rep and it's really not that bad. He continued to say if I was dealing with the pain right now that well that the surgery shouldnt be a problem for me. It was also said that I would recieve a packet in the mail for pre-op prep which I never recieved. After calling twice I was told that I needed to take a fleet enima the night before and the morning of the surgery. I was dissapointed about having surgery but felt a little relieved. The surgery was scheduled for two weeks after the doctors appointment which was the 19th of June, 2017.Surgery was fine, anesthesiologist was excellent. I did not see the doctor after surgery which I thought was strange, and was discharged with prescriptions and directions for care. The first day I was bleeding as much as you would imagine a surgery wound would bleed. I was given Oxycodone/Acetaminophen in a 5/325mg caplet for pain, Ketotolac 10mg as an anti-inflammatory, told to take Citrucel Tablets once a day, and prescribed a cream of Diclofenac 3%/Lidocaine 1.5%/Metronidazole 10%/Nifedipine 0.5%. The instructions also stated that if I did not have a bowel movement after 4 days to take Milk of Magnesia twice a day until I do.After 4 pretty easy days I still hadn't had a bowel movement and wasn't taking pain medication because it really wasnt that bad. I'm not really one to complain about pain. So i began taking Mild of Magnesia and on the fifth day I had a bowel movement. It was aweful, about an hour on the toilet, lost a lot of blood (maybe 1/4 pint), and ripped out one stitch. I had surgery on the 19th of June and that day was Friday the 23rd. I had planned to go back to work on the following Monday earlier that week but after that day I called and confirmed I would not be going back to work the next week. I had been taking two sitz baths a day, I took one after and literally just went to bed. I continued to bleed a moderate amount for the next two days. On that Monday I had another bowel movement that was far worse than the first, I had never been so constipated in my entire life, and lost the rest of my stitches. I had been taking pain meds since the 23rd. I started readin up and contacted the doctor. The doctor said that thw medication was correct and that sometimes people loose stitches early but and open wound there wasn't a major worry as long as kept clean. After another very bad bowel movement i started researching laxatives and found out the citrucel was a bulking agent and discontinued taking it. I switched to a stool softener and things got a little better. After two weeks the follow up appointment came, in which the doctor who did my surgery had another doctor do the follow up. After examination, he noticed I had lost all of my stitches and ofcourse still wasnt healed. I also asked because It still looked identical to before the surgery except with an incision next to the hemorrhoid. I was told that the lump was just swelling and that over the next week or two it would naturally go down. He also stated that the open wound wasnt a big deal just more aggravating than a real problem. I also told him that I stopped taking the citrucel and started taking a stool softner. I'm now just over 5 weeks after surgery with my supposedly final appointment is in about a week. I still bleed everyday and more after every bowel movement (maybe a teaspoon or two at most) and they are still painful but not that bad. My first three were almost unmanageable. It now seems like I have another thrombosed hemorrhoid, which is crazy because I'm having a much easier time now than right after surgery, I'm so sick of this. I'm going to see if I cant make an appointment this week.Is a stool bulking agent normally prescribed after a hemorrhoidectomy? That just doesn't seem like a great idea, I firmly believe it didn't do me any favors. Should it take 6-8 weeks to heal? Should I seek a second opinion? Anyone having this surgery should prepare a week before by changing their diet, I wouldn't recommend taking citrucel, take a stool softner and begin it before your surgery, just take two weeks off if you can. The surgery doesn't have a bad rep. I was really of the opinion that most people just don't deal well with pain and that it wouldn't be that much of a big deal. I was wrong. After ripping out stitches in such a sensitive place I'd give it an 8, painful enough to have trouble thinking about anything else. Breaking my femur and having it straightened to be put in traction was like a 7. It's one of those things where you're tired of constantly being uncomfortable even when you don't hurt. "

The reason I went there was because I had burning, itching around my anus and I still do. It looks fine and healthy when it's in normal state, but when I push, it becomes swollen like a balloon. Removing the internal haemorrhoids didn't fix anything. The doctor said these lumps cannot be removed because (well...) I'll start pooping myself. But they have to be removed somehow, I cannot live like this any more, it burns like hell and it's hard to wipe sometimes. I have provided a sample photo illustration of what appears to be my problem (the haemorrhoids are marked in green). Please advise me what are the solutions for this!

"Piles","Hemrrhoid surgery recovery","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hemrrhoid-surgery-recovery-604305","Hello Everyone,I wished I had found this discussion board before my surgery for I truly would not have had my surgery. I went in totally blind and I am very ashamed of myself for not getting a second opinion or researching the surgery myself before. I had external and internal hemorrhoids and the one that was external had been ""out"" for at least 5 years and it was sort of huge. It did not bother me. It didn't give me pain but it was ugly. And the fact that I knew it was hanging and my husband knew it, bothered me. It made me feel less sexy in the bedroom. Everytime I would visit my gyno, they always asked if I wanted it removed. Sometimes I had to got to the gastro doc because of passing blood in my stools and they asked if I wanted it removed. I always said no. I am fine. I can live with it because I always heard it was very painful to remove. I don't know what possessed me this year to go ahead with the surgery but my doctor warned me that I would actually end up hating him because of the pain. I really thought he was putting a little humor in the 'talk"" we had to ease my fear. He was not lying. And I am not lying to you all. I had my surgery on Tuesday, July 25th. The first day I came home, I was okay. I was like okay, I can deal with this. I had not had a bowel movement yet. Second day came and I still had not had a bowel movement and I asked my husband to take a picture of my bum so I could see what it looked like down there cause I was experiencing a little stinging. It actually looked good down there and I noticed a plug looking thing. I called the office and they told me it was a gauze and to leave it alone and let it pass on its on. Second day I actually felt good enough to go to the store and buy some herbal chinese tea to make me go. Cause I was really worried I had not gone in two days. Third day came and that is when the HELL visisted me in the bathroom. Third day, I tried to pass a bowel movement and it was the most horrific terrifying excruitiating pain I have ever felt in my life. The pain split my stitches, went down my lower back came up and hit my heart really bad. I am a heart patient with Congestive Heart failure and I am telling you I thought I was having a heart attack. The pain was literally unbearable. I was sweating, crying, shaking and having muscle spasms. My poor husband didn't know what to do. He tried rubbing my back, I called my mother and her personality did not help at all, her first response was yelling at me to calm me down which only made things worse. HOw in the hell do you yell at someone to calm them down? I could not take her so I went back to the bathroom cause something was trying to pass out, blood splattered everywhere, and the stool got stuck midway, my muscles kept spasmsing out and the pain was horrible. Sweat was pouring off me and my heart was in so much pain. I thought I would pass out.l was so weak at that point and dizzy. My husband took me to the E.R. We first went to the where I had the surgery and they were so freakin rude and unprofessional in the check in, we left and went to another division of that hospital in another city. They were excellent. They immediately got me back in the back and took vitals. My blood pressure was out the roof. Because I was a heart patient, they worked first on getting my blood pressure down. The PA on duty was so super nice. She explained to me what the procedure had consisted of and how to recover at home. She said my doctor should have explained all this too me and I should not have been eating solid food so early. I should have been on a light bland almost liquid diet for the first week to help ease with the stools. The only complaint I had with them was the RN who was ignorant about pain in that area as she applied the deadening cream to my bum. She had not compassion at all. Just rude. It is amazing how rude these people are here in Texas. Anyway, I would not advise this surgery to NOBODY. Not even my WORST ENEMY. And I got some people that I truly hate. I would not even wish this on them. In fact, they should make this a capital punishment for the worst offenders of crime. That is how bad this is. For those who had a good recovery, good for you. I am proud of you but for us who did not, I FEEL FOR YOU ALL AND I KNOW WHAT YOU ALL ARE GOING THROUGH. For those who say it is more horror stories on here, have you ever stopped and thought that there is a reason for that? THIS SURGERY IS HORRIBLE. THE PAIN IS HORRIFIC. We are not lying. This is the worse surgery ever. I wold not recommend this surgery for nobody. Just deal with your hemorrhoids especially if they are not causing you pain. RESEARCH. RESEARCH. RESEARCH for natural remedies. EAT A WELL BALANCED HIGH FIBER RICH DIET. Take care of your INTESTINES and they will take care of you. DO NOT EVER STRAIN IF YOU HAVE CONSTIPATION. TAKE CARE OF YOUR CONSTIPATION IMMEDIATELY. EAT LOTS OF RAW FRUITS AND VEGGIES AND DRINK LOTS OF FIBER RICH DRINKS. JUICE YOUR OWN JUICE IF YOU CAN. I truly wished I had done all the research before. I am on Day 9 and I am still in hell. Blood is still passing when I have bowel movements. I am scared to death to eat anything. My bowels are now too loose cause I refuse to eat anything solid. My skin is always stinging and hurting down there. It hurts so bad and stays sore down there that I can't even wipe myself without pain. I live in the bathroom either soaking or on the stool. My back is still hurting from all the trauma. My butt hole looks horrible since the bowel movements now. I had no one but my husband to help me in recovery and at first he was a darling and he was helping but now he is being a jerk not being compassionate nor understanding that this thing is lasting this long. I am beginning to hate him, myself and I definitely hate my surgeon. There is no relief. I just pray and meditate. My bowels just come out on their own and I cannot control them. I run to the toilet. If I wasn't wearing pads, I would have stools everywhere. This is not an exxageration. IT IS THE GOD GIVEN TRUTH. Don't do this if you do not have to. Sorry if you feel there is more horror stories on here than good recoveries. I feel there is a reason for that because there are less people who experience a good recovery. This is a long hard rough recovery even my E.R. doctor told me that and she was not lying. I am on Day 9 and it still feels like HELL. DAy 1 and Day 2 were way better than this. Good Luck Everybody. Wishing we all recover soon and well and with no more complications. Be blessed and Well. Hugs and Love to all who are suffering with this surgery recovery. "

Once awake enough I went to my room. Ate a bit, had to do two wees and could go home at 7pm. During that time my pain was a 2/10 and discomfort 7/10. There was a little gauze in my bottom as well. I felt really sick on the drive home, maybe motion sickness but it passed. I declined all extra pain meds in hospital but had my Panadol and anti inflammatory before bed. They also have me 20ml lactolose to take.The Next Day / TodayI woke with about 2/10 pain and 8/10 discomfort. Also have some pelvic discomfort. I took another Panadol and another antiflammatory. I moved around a fair bit taking care of my little one. After an hour I was able to open my bowel. The gauze came out and it wasn't so bad. My anus did hurt a bit and had to pat dry with wet toilet paper. I had a sitz bath and went to bed. Was feeling a bit sick.I woke and went for a little walk. I did a suppository because I also have a rectocele and needed to clear it. It wasn't to painful to pass the BM after but it has made me a bit sore and also uncomfortable in my pelvis. I've been laying down and put a bit of ice between my bum cheeks.I had some blood in both bowel motions My surgeon told me ppl get pain because of a Banding being to tight, band near or last the dentate line, to many banded at once, thrombosis. I guess my bands have Been placed ok but he said thrombosis could happen at anytime. So in general I'm uncomfortable with some pain but not horrible.

"Piles","My Hemorrhoidectomy Journey (Part 1)","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-hemorrhoidectomy-journey-part-1--583502","Hi there! My name is Michelle and I am going to be 29 over the summer plus my husband & I are going to be celebrating our 9th wedding anniversary this summer as well. Today is March 29th, 2017 and I'm scheduled to have my Hemorrhoidectomy on April 28th, 2017. There's a chance I might have it a few days before, but will know for sure by the end of this week. So, let me start from the beginning of why I'm getting this procedure done.I have been a constipated person all my life. The hemorrhoids, well, honestly, I don't exactly remember when they began...I just recall it was before or after having our first child. My oldest one was born 3 mos shy of my 21st birthday in 2009. He was born vaginally and I had an episiotomy at the time as well. Our other 3 children were born via c-section. After having my 3rd one in 2011, that's when the bleeding & pain from the rectum really began almost nonstop every time I needed to have a bowel movement.Due to being busy with family, and other things, plus lack of insurance, I just dealt with those symptoms for over 5 years. I bled a lot almost everytime I had a BM, and sometimes I would even bleed rectally when I just had to pee. The pain was excruciating often when I had BMs, at least 3 times a week, whether or not I bled. And then there was the lingering pain from those episodes that stayed with me throughout the rest of the day which makes sitting down and walking uncomfortable. As if that was not enough, I would get a horrible, bad pulsating pain from the hemmorrhoid itself about once a month or so lasting about a day or 2 each time. I still do dread going to the bathroom when I feel I have to poo because most of the times it's just too painful So, finally, after getting my insurance back and now that all my kiddos were about to begin school full time, last summer I decided to start making dr appts and began with seeing a new primary dr in July of 2016. In addition to sending me to other specialists for other minor health issues, he sent me to see a G.I. dr. In August, I saw the G.I. Dr for the first time who ordered a colonoscopy. In September, I had the colonoscopy done, and Dr found and removed a polyp, and said that I have hemorrhoids, one of them very large. So, when I went to my followup appt in October, G.I dr said that the hemmorrhoid should be treated. I told him that I already tried other methods a few years before, like cream and the rectal pills, forgot what they're called, but nothing has even helped. Then he suggested to get it removed or else it will just get worse in the future, as if it wasn't already bad enough. I said ok and he referred me to a colorectal surgeon whom I saw for the first time in December. She checked me and said that I have an anal fissure which has to heal first before getting the hemmorrhoid removed to avoid infection. She also said that the fissure is the main reason why I have been bleeding for what seems forever. She gave me several mini Analphram cream tubes to apply back there, and put me on a fiber diet. I had been seeing her once a month since then, and so glad that the bleeding has gone away for most part, but the pain is still there no matter what and won't leave me alone. I even had a hair get tied up on my hemorrhoid about a month ago, lol...it stung and hurt so much, that even after my husband was able to free my hemorrhoid from that hair, I still wasn't able to sit or walk right for the rest of the day So, finally, just last week, she finally gave me the ok to go ahead with getting the hemorrhoid removed. The fissure is not 100% healed yet, but pretty close to getting there and healing well enough to go through with the procedure. It has been scheduled to get it done in a month.When I had my most recent appt with the colorectal surgeon last week, I was busy with other things, family, and plus friends visiting out of town. Honestly, it didn't really sink in about the whole surgery thing until earlier this week when I finally had sometime to settle down from all the busy-ness...OMG!Last week when I asked the colorectal surgeon about the hemmorrhoid surgery because the pain and feeling uncomfortable won't leave me alone, she did warn me that after the procedure, it will be at least 2-3weeks of a lot of pain and more uncomfortable-ness. I said ok, I just want to get it over with. Well, earlier this week after really realizing what I may be in for, I Googled this procedure, and have read so many horror stories about this which honestly have me really nervous and scared about getting this done. Besides that, I have also read many tips & advice on how to manage an easier recovery despite the fact that the excruciating pain will be there no matter what especially the first 3-7 days after the hemorrhoidectomy is done. I felt that I have gotten so much insight regarding this procedure from this site in addition to other sites. So, since I feel that everything I've read so far has helped me in some way, I feel that it would only be fair & helpful as a way to give back to post my experience of my Hemorrhoidectomy for others going through the same to read and hopefully take something good from it. My Hemorrhoidectomy won't be done until a month from now, so no real hemorrhoidectomy experience to share yet, but I begin by posting this, and will post updates of what I'm going to be doing to prepare for this day in addition to posting about my recovery period after I go through with the procedure.I am going to start planning about when to cut off red meats completely and also when to start on a liquid diet. I have already started taking laxatives again that my dr had prescribed. I had stopped taking them weeks ago and started getting constipated again, so now I'm back taking them. I'm also trying to increase my water intake as it's already a bad habit of mine to not drink sufficient water. Plus, as of next week (after I take a full trip to the grocery store), I plan to increase my intake in fruits & veggies. Terrible how I have my kiddos eat those, but I don't do enough of that for myself, lol. These are just beginning pointers of what I'm beginning to do and plan.You see, I really hope to God that the recovery and pain does not really take that long. As a matter of fact, I hope a 3-week recovery is possible because there is so much to do and so much to look forward to that I hope this doesn't delay/ruin things, lol. My husband and I have a date night to tend to because of a concert we're planning to attend on May 26th. We already have tickets. Would be a shame to not br able to go or enjoy concert due to pain. In addition to that, we're planning for our kids' birthday party to be on the 20th of May. Too soon after hemorrhoidectomy? Guess we'll see, but I really don't want to ruin it for the kids. Then there's the part how my husband will tackle the kids and house especially the first week of my recovery in addition to his busy work schedule. I don't want it to be too much for him which is why I truly want a quick recovery. As everyone else has said, it will get better and afterall, at the end, it will be worth it, or so they say, heheheh. In a later post either later this week or next week, I'll post more about my plans in preparing for this day. Thanks for taking the time in reading this & by the way, any questions/comments/feedback is greatly appreciated - thanks in advance! "
"Piles","Preparing for a haemorrhoidectomy","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/preparing-for-a-haemorrhoidectomy-601852","In the great scheme of things, a haemorrhoidectomy is way down the list of serious medical interventions, unless, of course, there are complications.I’m a fit and healthy 69 year old male who had a haemorrhoidectomy on the 1st March 2017. The operation itself went relatively well and eventually (a month later) healed nicely but the immediate aftermath was a nightmare involving admission to A&E with urine retention and a blocked colon requiring both a catheter and an emergency colon operation. If there was a complication to be had, I got it including a UTI (Urinary Tract Infection), post catheter debris in my bladder and colitis. Nearly five months on I’m still having tests and camera up both ends!On reflection, the problem appeared to be that the trauma of the operation tipped the balance for other things that were happening with my body rather than anything inherently to do with the operation.My offering to the community is therefore about being prepared for the aftermath of the operation.1. Absolutely top of the list – make sure you are not suffering from constipation before the operation. Having a bowel movement after the procedure is not as bad as you might expect UNLESS you’re constipated. You want those movements to glide out, not be forced.2. Don’t wait to go to the doctor about your haemorrhoids; they will only get worse and involve a bigger operation. Sort them early.3. Get as fit as you can before the operation. Any operation can be a traumatic experience for your body and the aftermath of a haemorrhoidectomy can be particularly painful, being fit helps.4. If you don’t have a bidet at home buy a ‘sitz’ bath (no, I didn’t know what one of these was either!). This a ‘portable bidet’ and you can buy them on Amazon for a few pounds/dollars/euros. This allows you to not only wash your backside but provides much needed comfort and relief.5. You will probably be told that the first week after the operation is very uncomfortable but you’ll start to feel better from the second week. Maybe for the lucky few, but I’d say clear the decks for a good two weeks.6. Maintain as scrupulous hygiene as you can. The period after the operation can be messy as your backside settles down and learns to work in its new configuration!7. The aftermath can be very painful. Take the maximum amount of pain killers you can safely take. Remember there are types of pain killers that can be taken with other types of pain killers – ask your doctor for advice.Finally - The best piece of advice I saw when researching the procedure was the comment that “You will survive!” There were times when I wondered, but here I am pretty well back to normal; You will indeed survive!Good luck!"

"Piles","Had haemorrhoids for years, or so I though. But having successfully treated topically the site of irritation is moving around.","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/had-haemorrhoids-for-years-or-so-i-though-but-having-successfully-treated-topically-the-site-of-irritation-is-moving-around--61846","Hi there. This is an awkward thing to describe as it may sound a bit like I'm getting worked up over nothing, or maybe seeing things where they aren't. However, I assure you I'm not.Throughout the last ten years I've suffered from regular bouts of anal irritation. My anus regularly feels raw and itchy and the condition of the skin around my anus weeps and is red and inflamed. This has always been accompanied by a few spots of blood when I wipe.For ages I thought it was a fissure, as there were no protuberances of veins or anything,I've tried to treat it in a few different ways. It has responded to anti fungal cream in the past, which prompted me to try treating it as a candida albicans problem, perhaps due to a food allergy. I tried modifying my diet - cutting out sugar. It made no real difference so I stopped that. I've also practised keeping the area very clean - washing it after a bowel movement with soap designed for sensitive skin or wet toilet tissue if in a public toilet.The upshot is, during the years and through trial and error, I've established two things. 1. No treatment has ever worked consistently and 2. my arse is very sensitive! Even the bleach in toilet tissue can irritate it - so I stopped wetting it to clean my anus. I seem to be intolerant to onions, spices, red wine and garlic, which make my butt crack burn and the skin break down and weep right up the crack.If I cut these foods out of my diet and wash the area at least twice a day the problem seems to limit itself to just my anus, and greatly alleviates even that. But it does not disappear completely. And if I lax in my cleansing routine it quickly becomes worse.So I started to think in a woolly sort of way, could this thing be an auto-immune complaint of some sort - similar to eczma or psoriasis perhaps? One of those ailments whose cause and remedy aren't really understood. This is when I visited my doctor, to try and talk about what I had found. I also think I finally got tired of putting up with this low-level discomfort 90% of the time, wanting finally to do something about it!My doctor didn't physically examine me, but asked me 'Do you see blood on the toilet tissue when you wipe, but not mixed in with your stools?'. I said 'yes'. 'It's just haemorrhoids' said the doctor. So I left the surgery feeling somewhat reassured by this simple, straightforward and robust diagnosis! But also a bit baffled it hadn't occurred to me sooner. And even a bit doubtful, as if in my gut (excuse pun) I doubted the solution was so simple. But I bought some haemorrhoid cream - called Anusol - and tried it...And it worked! The area of irritation around my anus cleared up completely!However, after a few days completely symptom free - horror of horrors, I started to get an itchy rash either side of my anus, on the normal skin of my butt cheeks. My anus itself was fine, but the rash around it burned and came up in weals.So I treated this with antiseptic and also plucked the hair from the area - which greatly relieved the situation. While also still treating my anus with anusol daily, as I was kinda scared the haemorrhoids would flair up again as well as the rash! After 2 weeks though the rash had cleared up and the haemorrhoids were still absent. I had another couple of symptom-free daysBut then... most recently I've been experiencing Tenesmus symptoms - a feeling of pressure inside my back passage, as if I want to empty my bowels, regardless whether I need to or not. Like something pushing my intestines from the inside out. I've NEVER experienced a feeling like this before. It's been here consistently for about three days now.I know Tenesmus is a symptom of a few things but one of them is colitus. I also have a friend with Ulcerative Colitus whose life has been blighted by it and I know some of the symptoms. So I'm worried I may be in the early stages of a bout of colitus or some other irritation of the bowel. Perhaps you'll understand why I would rather be cautious and raise my concerns early.I make no secret I have a sort of inbuilt fear of getting Colitus based on my friend's experiences. I'm feeling a bit superstitious and silly at this point too: I've tried so many ways to alleviate my sore arse and the site of irritation now seems to be moving around and evading my attempts to treat it! The thought I have some sorts of 'bad humours' creeping and migrating around my body has got lodged in my mind. I'm worried this area of irritation, having been turned out of its home in my anus, having attempted to migrate down south as a rash only to be thwarted has now set its mind on burrowing north - up my anal canal, infecting me with colitus!!!I know, it's a ridiculous idea. Phantom 'bad humours' with some sort of malignant intelligence! Once again I crave your pardon. But... is it all that silly after all??Are there some sorts of autoimmune responses that can move around in this seemingly coordinated way?Or could there be any other pattern to what I'm experiencing, that I've missed entirely? Or am I just being rather unlucky and/or going quite mad?Please help. Thanks so much, Bob."

I am a suspected coeliac, and have been gluten free for 5 years.There is a history of haemorrhoids/polyps in the family, and as much as I have tried very hard with my diet, there was no escaping them it seems! About 2 months before the operation, a haemorrhoid turned up, and progressively got worse to the point it was prolapsed.I had surgery to have them removed, three in total. The first two weeks were pretty rough, and I was very anxious/careful for the following four weeks. (I got married 6 weeks after my operation!)I was actually in between jobs at the time and took four weeks off. I know that’s not possible for a lot of people, but I think for me the rest was really beneficial to my own recovery as I wasn’t very strong before the operation.I had a follow up appointment 6 weeks after the op and was told there was a ‘small haemorrhoid’ – gutted doesn’t even cover it.Four the last couple of months I feel a lot calmer, healthier and happier. The operation was certainly worth doing – but I do worry about the ‘small one’. I can feel it, and have at times used cream for a few days to get on top of it. I do worry about it turning into something more, but figure I am doing the best I can and if it gets worse I will get on top of it a lot quicker.I watch my diet like a hawk! I eat a lot of fruit/veg, plenty of water, avoid trigger foods and avoiding stress where ever possible. I leave plenty of time for the bathroom in the morning too. On reflection I wish I had the operation a lot sooner (or had at least been aware of what treatments were available) to get them resolved/improve the situation. I had been suffering for years, and should not have let them impact my life as much as they did. Yes the operation was terrifying and the recovery was pretty miserable – but for me it was very much worth it. I know everyone is different and not everyone is going to be without complications. This is where I really believe you have to listen to your body (and mind) about what you feel is right and wrong. There is no point suffering and wondering unnecessarily. Go and get some advice, see the doctor, ask your family for help! I have posted my original Post below, for tips/things that I learnt and found helpful for my recovery. If you are reading this and wondering what the hell you are about to let yourself in for(!), or are in recovery wondering if it will ever end(!) … it will. Just remain positive and calm. Do the best you can for your body – it will take time, be patient, but it will get better. Good luck, and super speedy recovery to you all! Sophie -- -- -- -- Hi Everyone,Its been just over two weeks from my surgery and I really wanted to post some tips that I have found/finding helpful in my recovery and some positive thoughts post haemorrhoidectomy surgery!Context:I am a 30 year old woman, slim and in fairly good health based in the UK.I have been suffering with IBS for about 15 years, haemorrhoids on and off for about the last 10 years, but more frequently in the last 5. I am a suspected coeliac, and have been gluten free for 5 years.There is a history of haemorrhoids/polyps in the family, and as much as I have tried very hard with my diet, there was no escaping them it seems!Just over two months ago, a haemorrhoid turned up, and progressively got worse to the point it was prolapsed (reoccurring from months previous). I tried every cream available but after four weeks, several doctors/hospital appts I was in agony and there was no sight of it getting better. With an impending wedding (six weeks to go) I went for a private consultation out of sheer desperation (the referral for the NHS was weeks away even though I was in A&E!).It was advised I needed surgery for an exclusional haemorrhoidectomy, using diothermy, to remove three large haemorrhoids.Like everyone else, I turned to the internet for some advice and insight … this is a good and a bad thing!There was some great information out there, but equally some horrifying stories too that really put me off. I wanted to put a list of tips that I have found helpful, and a bit about how I’m doing too because I’m feeling pretty positive about it so far, and I think its important to not let your head take over from how your feeling physically. The key: preparation, preparation, preparation!1. Diet before surgeryI was taking Fybogel (stool softener) and Laxiode (laxative) for about a week before surgery on top of a high fiber diet. This was in part because I was having difficulty passing stools because of the haemorrhoids, but on reflection I think this really helped with the recovery.I found a good balance of all the drinks/painkillers, had an idea of what all the gurgling/cramps were all about and felt like my stomach was moving well already.2. Buy spares of pants/knickers/Pj’sBuy spare pairs of pants/knickers/PJ’s before the surgery. I found I was changing about three times a day for about a week and bending down to put things in the washing machine was not going to be an option!3. Everything in reach.Go round your bedroom/bathroom/house and put everything in reach, ie not on the floor.4. Day of Surgery: Questions and snacksAsk any questions you have, regardless how silly. It will make you feel better and in more control.Take some snacks/drink with you. That sandwich that they wanted me to eat before I left … nope, not going to happen!5. First 24/48hrs: SupportHave someone drive you home, and lay down flat in the back of the car.You NEED someone with you for the first 24 hours at least. I found the come down from the general aesthetic/surgery pretty awful. I was all over the place, very unstable on my feet and unable to think properly. I couldn’t get in/out of the bath without help, let alone the stairs. If I had fallen over in this time, I am not sure I would have been able to get back up.Having someone to call on for fear of moving to cause pain was really reassuring, let alone bring you food/drinks.6. Pain medication: write it down!Keep on top of your pain medication. Set an alarm if you have to, you don’t want to let the pain take over, its really hard to wait for the painkillers to kick in.Write down what you are having and when. In the first 48 hrs I really couldn’t get my thoughts together and would forget what Id had. I managed to take too much one morning and was very sick. It also helps for the person looking after you to check in on how your doingListen to your body about what is/isn’t working. It took me a couple of days to work out that Tramadol was making me very sick! This was not helpful when trying to keep medication, food and drink down. Once I swapped out for Codine I felt a lot brighter.7. Mix laxative drinks with lemonade! (Specifically Laxiode)I found the laxatives too awful to drink straight, lemonade really helped. 8. Deep breathingYes its going to hurt, but if you have to go, go. I read a bit about the lamaze technique and found this helpful. When the pain hits its easy to just stop breathing and strain (do not do this!) Keep taking long deep breaths, I found it really helpful and gave me something to focus on.9. Squatting StoolI have a stool under my feet when having a BM. There is a strong argument that this position reduces the strain on the rectum, I have found this really helpful and recommend it. I use an empty plastic container upturned, it easy enough to kick out of the way when finished rather than picking it up.10. Sitz bath and showersBefore a bowel movement, get the shower running. You can hop straight in and get clean without wiping (not going to happen!). Don’t use soap, it aggravates.Then run a bath (no salts or soap) and get comfortable for about 20 mins. The bath really was my savour, it really helped relieve the pain, hygiene and I felt promoting healing. (Also, make sure your plug works!)Have two towels – drying off with a wet towel just makes everything even more miserable.11. Condoms filled with water!There is nothing more entertaining than having your 60 year old mother fill condoms with water, this alone will cheer you up!.Ice packs straight after a BM and throughout the day for the first week or so were a life saver. I really feel they helped get the swelling/bruising down. Icepacks were too bulky, crushed ice in bags were either lumpy or had sharp corners.Condoms frozen in the freezer were by the best solution! Perfect shape, no leaks(!) and soft to touch.12. Moisturisera. The baths, and the laxatives, really dried out my skin. Use a good moisturiser to save flaky itchy skin.13. HydrationYou need to drink lots of water, all day long, so get a bottle of water. Drinking out of a glass was just messy and a bottle of water (a half sized one) was easier to lift and allowed me to keep track of just how much I was drinking.14. Hair dryerUsing a towel to dry off was not an option, a hair dryer was a good option. I also found when resting if I was leaking mucus a folded up tissue was helpful.I also used sanitary pads and tenna lady knickers for leakage. The knickers were really helpful to sleep in. 15. Find your routine Because of my IBS and general panic over my bowl I was terrified about BM’s and how often they should be happening. Its safe to say, with the medications, altered diet and stress that my BM’s were all over the place in the first week. I think this is normal but I was keen to get back to a more regular pattern. I think its advisable to aim for your regular movement and not what the internet tells you!16. Diet after surgeryFor the first five days I drank a lot of fresh juices, fruit and veg. I did not eat any bread or red meat. I ate quite a lot of potatoes and rice too. Your aiming for soft stools, not watery or solid. You need volume as well, so try an eat as best you can.Having some other little snacks available if the mood took me was a real nice to have. I have so far avoided anything sweet like cakes, caffine, spicey foods.17. RestWeek one - I literally did not get out of bed apart from trips to the bathroom. I found lying on my left hand side the most comfortable.Week two - I made a point of getting on my feet at least once an hour for a few mins, and increased as the week went on. I also started to go out for short walks for about 10 mins and found this really helpful for my mood more than anything.Week three - I feel like I can sit down (all be it on the sofa). I am much more up and about around the house, and have been out for short journeys in the car. I am being very careful not to pick up heavy items or over do it.18. Netflix!I think Netflix may have saved me on boredom and been the perfect distraction! I am an active person with an active mind so I knew resting was going to be difficult. I got stuck into House of Cards and found it the best distraction because I was so absorbed. I also wanted to go and watch the next episode desperately so was forced to relax! (And yes, I did all four seasons in about 10 days!) I am pretty sure resting properly has really helped with my recovery so far.19. Back to workI am fortunately between jobs at the moment so feel I can take the time to get better at my own speed. Personally, I would not want to go back to sitting at a desk, commuting or standing around for at least 14 days.I feel like I could go back today (day 16), but I think I would ended up taking painkillers for swelling.20. ComplicationsReading peoples experiences there are plenty of complications associated with this surgery and I have been, and continue to be worried about all of them. It really is a mind game. I have made the mental decision to listen to my body, and if something doesn’t seem right then I will go and see someone about it rather than fretting about it. If your not confident in the answer you’ve got, go and see someone else.ConclusionFor me personally I had been in excruciating pain for about 6 weeks prior to the surgery. I was incredibly uncomfortable, miserable and stressed. I was very anxious that the pain would be worse post surgery as to be honest, I couldn’t take much more. To put it into context, for the two weeks prior I hadn’t really left the house as the pain from the BM left me with spasms all day long.I read far too much on the internet before hand on the procedure and this really panicked me.The day of the op and two days after were pretty miserable, but the painkillers really helped. I would say the pain I had before the surgery was far worse which is why I feel my experience has been relatively positive so far. I was just grateful to be knocked out for the surgery as I felt utterly drained with it all.I have had some bleeding and mucus discharge, but nothing that has really made me want to dash to A&E. I was also sent home with a weeks work of antibiotics in case of infection which made me feel more reassured.I can imagine if you have troublesome haemorrhoids on and off for a number of years and have got exasperated with them but are generally still working/on your feet, that the pain/enforced recovery could be a real shock. Its really not pleasant and there is no getting away from it. You essentially have an open wound in an unclean place, with muscles that move.Its certainly a type of pain I have never experienced before.I have been in a very fortunate position that I was able to go private. Not only was I seen quickly and feel really supported with numbers to call/information, I also felt I had some control over my surgeon.I did a hell of a lot of research and ended up seeing a very highly regarded specialist in this field. I credit her largely with my recovery so far and confidence in what’s happening. If you have the option, go and find the best you can. Being on Day 16 I am feeling pretty good. I am on no painkillers, I would not say I am in pain in general, but I can certainly feel something there. The BM in the morning is still fairly painful, but manageable. For me it was about day 14 that I felt like things were finally improving properly.For the next few weeks I am going to continue with the laxatives/stool softener as I feel over exertion could set me back if I am not careful. For the future, I think I will now take stool softners at least once a day and be even more vigilant in what I am eating – I really don’t want to have to go through this again!For anyone reading this who is about to have surgery – remain calm and positive. It wouldn’t have been advised to you unless it was really necessary.For anyone out there who is in recovery and having a bad day – hang on in there! Its done now, you are doing the best you can … it will get better!Best wishes to all,Sophie "

"Piles","hemmorhoids - bleeding after ever bowel movement","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hemmorhoids-bleeding-after-ever-bowel-movement-598935","I'm getting frustrated with internal piles that I can't get under control. I've had a colonosopy - bit over year ago - which found internal hemmorhoids but nothing else. I've had bleeding on and off for a couple of years. Over the last month or two, I can't manage a bowel movement without some bleeding and it's getting to me. I raised the issue on my last visit to see my gastro-enterologist and, as an ongoing issue, I tell my GP about it and ask if there's any more I can do. I've tried the obvious self help (diet full of fibre, don't get constipated, raise legs with stool on toilet, suppositories, creams) but can't get it under control. The response of the doctors is to listen then offer nothing more to what I've tried. Last junior consultant said she'd avoid any surgical intervention with 'that area' because of possible complications.It's having a psychological impact too. I used to have 2 or 3 normal (ie not too loose) bowel movements a day. Now, I get so anxious at the prospect of going, i have one a day or one ever two days. I've tried intermittent fasting to 'take the strain' off the area and let it have a chance to heal - doesn't work. Also tried enemas to help me go without stress. They help, but the bleeding comes back. As I say, I'm not constipated anyway. I have to check the pan after going normally and always, now, the water is stained with blood. It doesn't seem like heavy amounts - I always spend only a couple of mins on the toilet, at most.So, in a nutshell, what to do. I don't relish surgery at all, but I can't just accept blood with every bowel movement. I know the piles could progress to a fistula/fissure, perhaps. I also wonder what sort of risk there would be to system infection if it goes on and on without resolution.Help would be appreciated on what more self help there might be (think I've tried most). I don't get much pain/any pain. Sometimes a slight sting with the bowel movement. Besides the blood and evidence of clot, my movements seem normal. I have a vascular liver disease of unknown original which is being monitored but not treated. Otherwise, reasonable health. Bloods normal. Male aged 60. Oh, and I am overweight. Would the simple act (not so simple!) of losing weight get it under control?If not self help, are there any other safe procedures that could be employed.Thanks for reading my post"

Afterwards, I washed up with warm water down there, finished cleaning up, etc. and went back to bed. What I felt afterwards was crazy. I felt shaky, as if I was trembling a bit and out of energy. And within a few minutes, the awful burning came. Started out gradually, and got stronger and quite unbearable I should say. And when I wanted to walk, it hurt sooo much. Pain pills and nothing would calm this burning pain. Lasted for several hrs. During evening hrs, pain finally started to go down to tolerable level. So, yeah, pain-filled day, along with nonstop rectal bleeding, and still some discharge/drainage as well. Not much change in diet. I've also been keeping up with stool softeners everytime I take pain pill and even in between the times I take pain pills.POD 6:Wednesday, May 3, 2017.Today was a similar scenario as yesterday. Bowel movement happened at around 11am, so a bit earlier today. The bm moment was a bit more painful, but still not as bad as I expected. Again, a bit shaken, and when horrible afterburn began, I also felt nausea, lots of it, and not sure why. I was in bed feeling terrible, and wanted to try to sleep it off, but only managed to sleep about 20min or so. I didn't want to know anything about food the rest of the day. The burning pain again stayed with me all day. I finally ate some soup and crackers by the end of the day. Still nonstop rectal bleeding and some rectal discharge/drainage, but less than the previous days. Still taking lots of stool softeners. Also, want to share that during the day while I was in lots of burning pain, I managed to do a bit of shopping online just to distract myself and because I had planned to do so this week anyways, not for myself, but for my mom, sister in law and a couple of friends. Ordered some flowers & treats to be delivered to each of them for Mom's Day, so am looking forward to when they get that later this wk..hope they enjoy POD 7:Thursday, May 4, 2017. Wow, it has officially been a week since surgery day! Am I feeling better? In general, I guess a tad bit..burning pain after BMs are definitely no fun, but when pain is at tolerable level, I can move around more easily and at least urinating doesn't hurt anymore, lol. Bowel movement happened a bit later today around 1pm. Was as painful as yesterday, bleeding as well, but didn't feel shaken as the previous days, and thankfully no nausea. Didn't do this the previous days after bm, so due to not looking forward to horrible afterburn pain and in hopes of trying to prevent it, I jumped in a hot shower. Shower was wonderful. No pain during shower whatsoever. Afterwards, the only thing it did is delayed the afterburn. Enough to comfortably brush my hair & get dressed. Then it started. Oh boy My mom and baby sis stopped by to see me & help out with kids for a couple hrs which was nice. Later during the early evening hrs, still in lots of pain, I managed to go outside for a bit. It hurt, but I felt I needed to do it, and walked very slowly like a penguin around the yard trying to enjoy the late daylight with my kiddos & husband. The bad pain stayed with me til later that evening and finally got to tolerable level by bedtime. Everything else in regards to diet, meds and bleeding was pretty much the same as the previous day.POD 8:Friday, May 5, 2017.Today is our pet doggie's, Chip, first birthday. Since I usually have a painful time walking now and spend lots of time in bed, Kiddos and husband brought Chip to bed so we could all sing Happy Birthday before they started getting ready for school. As soon as I awoke, I realized that I felt out of energy, as if I was in a weakened state. I could barely move and was in more pain than I usually am in mornings. Kids went to school, husband had to leave to work. I could barely get out of bed, and felt very light headed which is not usual for me at this time. Any walking I did were my trips to bathroom. My sister in law had the day off from work and decided to spend the day taking care of me, the house and later my kiddos. Very much appreciated. I had the urge to have bowel movement around 1pm, but it didn't happen. But I felt it qas there, so I made the mistake to push. Only bled more, and afterburn came anyways So, when bm didn't happen, I realized I was constipated. Not sure why. Diet was same, have stayed away from cheese, red meats, ice cream, etc. Have been taking lots of stool softeners more than the hydrocone pills. I honestly don't know what went wrong, but constipation happened. Anyways, went back to bed with painful afterburn. My diet today changed a bit because she cooked some fish. Hadn't had fish for what seemed forever, so I was grateful when she cooked some up, lol. Later, around 5pm, I had the urge to go again. Felt it, and again, pushed, which was not good. More blood, and much more afterburn pain. Plus pain spasms were back. Very frustrating I had some soup for dinner. Sister-in-law left around 9pm. With lots of pain & feeling very weak still, by bedtime, I felt pretty down about today. I couldn't even sleep despite taking more pain pills than usual due to pain. I felt as if it was a step back. I even felt as if the first couple days were somewhat easier compared to now that it has been over a week since surgery day. I stayed up almost all night and finally fell asleep by 4am, but was awake again around 8am.POD 9:Saturday, May 6, 2017.Today thank God was better than yesterday. Pain was at tolerable level all day long. I did wake up with some nausea though, but managed to eat a bit of cereal for breakfast. My husband had to go to work for a while today. I tended to kids' needs when necessary, and stayed in bed. My dad (who lived in Guatemala) called me to check up on me and we chatted for a bit. My Sister-in-law was back around noon. Handled the kids. I felt well enough to walk around, still like a penguin, but was up, and chatted with my Sister-in-law about everything. She stayed for only a couple hrs. I managed to wash a few dishes & do some laundry before husband came home. I had the urge to have bowel movement around 2pm, but when I went, nothing happened. I didn't try to push or strain this time, so no afterburn for once, yay, but still constipated. Didn't even take pain pills all days, except before bedtime, and only took stool softeners through out the day. Still bleeding rectally, but no.more discharge. Overall, in despite of conatipation, day went well compared to all the previous days. POD 10:Sunday, May 7, 2017.Too bad the extreme pain returned today but I see yesterday as a little break from the horrible, bad pain. Anyways, husband had the day off today as he usually does on Sundays. I stayed in bed most of the day again because the weakness seemed to have come back. Still constipated. Had a yummy salad for breakfast. Around noon, I seriously thought that I finally was going to go. Went to bathroom, and did the mistake to strain and push again. Just blood, and the usual awful afterburn. Felt it was a bit worse than previous afterburns. Kept me in bed all day. Nothing helped. Husband gave me ice pack. Didn't do much really. Eventually had chicken soup fpr lunch. Neighbors visited later in the afternoon and that distracted me a bit from the pain. Pain had finally come down to tolerable level during the evening hrs. For dinner, wasn't that hungry and just had some yogurt & fruit. Let's see what tomorrow brings.POD 11:Monday, May 8, 2017.Constipation is finally gone. Had bowel movement around 8:45am. So far, the most painful & intense one since surgery. Lots of blood as I expected. Felt very shaken afterwards. Washed up down there with warm water. Then as usual, awful burning began. Had some cereal for breakfast. Had pain pill hoping it would help and didn't help. Just dealt with it. Had chicken soup for lunch. Surprisingly, had another bm around 6pm while I was still dealing with afterburn from morning bm. Painful & Intense, yes. Blood, of course. In hopes that it would help with the anticipated extra afterburn, I jumped into hot shower. As soon as I got out of shower, the awful afterburn pain returned with a vengeance. Stayed in bed and for dinner, I had a nice salad. Around bedtime, I started feeling lots of pressure and horrible pain spasms in addition to afternoon pain. Went to bathroom, and had a 3rd bm. Wow. Washed up down there. Took another pain pill. And now, I'm still awake finishing up this post. For some reason, I have lots of nausea. Driving me crazy..going to take a pill for nausea. That's the end of POD 11.And yeah, that's my update. Will post part 7 probably by the end of this week. Any questions, comments, advice, feedback is greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading - take care & God Bless "

My name is Michelle and welcome to Part 4 of My Hemorrhoidectomy Journey! Please feel free to read parts 1, 2, & 3 to see how I have arrived to this point and why. Thanks in advance for reading my posts. Any comments/feedbacks is greatly appreciated as well.So, it's very late as I write this. You can say I'm at the end of POD #1, but it's past midnight here, so I guess the very early beginning of POD #2 now? Anyways, it's past midnight and officially Saturday, April 29, 2017 and so happy to say that it's officially my oldest son's bday who is turning 8. Won't be able to do anything with him today for his bday, and glad he's understanding of that, so thankfully my sis in law going to take him out for a bit, and anyways, we will be celebrating his bday & the rest of the kiddos' bday on the 27th of next month Now back to topic, less than 48 hours ago, I had my Hemorrhoidectomy. Yay, lol...let me start by saying no fun at all, but saw it coming anyways.So, shortly after kiddos left to school, got to the hospital with my husband at around 10:25am. They quickly got me into a gown & bed. Some paperwork, questions, took vitals, started iv, talked to my surgeon, then to anesthesia dr, and at around 12:15, they took me to operating room. Everyone was indeed very nice, and by the time I knew it, I was waking up in recovery room with pain in my rectum. I was just thinking, OMG, really?? The pain already so soon? Lol...So, I noticed my blood pressure was pretty low..in low 80s/50s, and had the BP machine checking my BP every 3 min or so. Gradually went up, and had me in recovery room for about 2 hrs before being discharged. Back to pain, it gradually got worse as minutes ticked by, and finally got the urge to ask nurse for pain med. She injected pain med into iv and quickly worked, but made me very dizzy and felt more week but at least pain had gone down a lot.After discharge, we got home. On the way home, every speed bump or sudden stop or whatever hurt. Just tried to sit on side, not on rectum. My mom, brother & Baby sis and my kiddos were all at my house, everyone very supportive. Layed down on couch with stomach faced down. Felt very nauseated, and pain was gradually coming back again. Eventually, my mom, brother & sister left, and husband picked up prescribed meds from pharmacy. Laxatives and hydrocodone. Will only take hydrocodone when pain gets too bad along with one or two laxatives to try to prevent constipation.Last night, I started taking the hydrocodone every 4-6 hrs along with the stool softeners. Also, something that I wanted to point out is that right after surgery, I felt my vaginal part very numb. At first, it felt very hard to pee. Also, the day of surgery, I continued to stick to liquids only diet...you know, water, jello, and soup broth with just a tad bit of veggies. Walking has been pretty tough especially when there's pain, so I have tried to avoid walking as much as I could on surgery day plus the bleeding on the day after surgery seemed normal, not too bad, just ok.Post Operation Day (POD) #1 - April 28:Woke up, took levothyroxine med as usual, then about an hr later, a hydrocodone. Husband left to work, but left me prepared with everything, chicken broth soup, some jello, ice pack, and the meds, well, already had them ready by my bedside prior to surgery. I was able to keep pain at a tolerable level I'm sure thanks to the hydrocodone. Like I said, every time I take one of those, I also take 1 or even 2 stool softeners. I tried to sleep during the day, but when kiddos were home from school, that was a no no. I felt the urge several times throughout the day to have a BM, but never happened. Everytime I would go to bathroom, I would just urinate and maybe pass a small bit of gas, that's about it. I have to say that I'm nervous about my first bm.post surgery...I feel that the worse is yet to come in that aspect. Have kept it clean...always change my pads and even though there has been no bm, I still gently clean with wipies. The bleeding was much less during day, but for some reason, I started bleeding more during the evening hours. I have not just been in bed all day, but have been walking some around the house especially when pain is calm. And just been walking like a penguin. Could be walking around often so soon post surgery be a cause for more bleeding down there? Just wondering. Will see how it goes later and the next few days. But yeah, that's how POD #1 went. I assume worse is yet to come since there hasn't been a BM yet..oh joy, heheheh.Oh yeah, before I forget, this is what Dr did to me on surgery day: She cut off the biggest hem (excisional), and banded the 2 smaller ones. Perhaps that may be the reason for the numbness/pressure I felt? Well, the numbness has worn off, but now there's just this pressure close to vaginal area that even hurts a bit or feels weird when I pee. And I guess the 2 banded ones will fall off in a few days, right? Wonder if that will also be painful.So, that's it for now. I do plan to start eating some solids again..strictly fiber, on either Sunday or Monday. Will post Part 5 in a couple days or so to update all of you on how the following days post surgery go for me. Any questions/comments/feedback is always greatly appreciated! Thanks again, God Bless & Take care "

It appeared right after I had a particularly rough BM where I strained a lot. There was very mild pain but I felt like there was something stuck in there right at the end you know? I examined the area and found that there is a protrusion right at the exit. It hurts to touch and on the top of it its a dark purple/black-ish hue. Anyway It appeared yesterday after that rough toilet visit and that was about a good 20 hours ago. So far it doesnt seem to have grown and the pain is still the same (mild-low) and sometimes none at all. Just feel blockage at the end. From what I've read these things tend to take care of themselves and there are steps you should take to make sure they dont flare up again. But my main worry right now is about my next BM which is going to have to happen soon. I am literally terrified to do it. And I was wondering if there was anything I can do to make the process easier? I'm not even sure how I'm going to get it out considering this thing is blocking the exit just the thought of it makes me more terrified. I've already been drinking water like a fiend. I took some stool softener and ate a bunch of fruit and veggies this morning too. So what can I do? What will happen if its another rough and strained BM? I'm not sure if this post will even get any responses before I have to but im hoping it will."

My name is Michelle and this is part 3 of My Hemorrhoidectomy Journey posts. My surgery is in exactly 3 days from today...scheduled for this Thursday (April 27, 2017). Please feel free to read My Hemorrhoidectomy Journey part 1 & part 2 posts to see what has led me up to the decision of getting the surgery done. Long story short, other treatment methods have not worked for me and have dealt with painful, bleeding hems for 5yrs..almost 6 actually.So, like I mentioned in part 2, we did go on our little Spring getaway to L.A. I felt it was the perfect escape we needed in the middle of lots of stressful things going on in addition to my upcoming surgery. That weekend, which was Easter wknd, was the last time I ate any red meats. Since then, he stuck to soft foods, fiber foods, and some fish. Plus am now taking 2 laxatives daily rather than just one. Am pretty consistent in eating at least 2-3 fruits & veggies per day, plus drinking more water than usual, but I feel that that hasn't been enough in obtaining very soft stools by now. I have been receiving some advice here from this site, plus have been doing lots more research on getting tips regarding this procedure. My being anxious about this has grown some over the last few days, so So has my hunger in more knowledge over the before, during, and after of this surgery, lol.**Here are some additional tips/advice/suggestions that I have gained/learned about during the last week and am highly considering:-No spicy foods-Take Laxative 12 hrs before surgery-Look up Squatting videos to be able to poo in a Squatting position which I supposed to make having a BM more comfortable & less painful post surgery-Stock up on baby wipes & pads (which I already have lots of anyways, so check)-Strict fiber diet 3 days prior to surgery-Clear liquids diet 1 day before and if possible, up to a week after surgery-After clear liquids diet, soft foods/high fiber, lots of liquids, no red meats for at least a month if possible-Hot water bottles? I think for rectum after bm...-Stick to pain meds (not the constipating ones) every 3 hrs (even during night time) for pain management.-Daily sitz baths-Doughnut pillowSo, yeah, I'm pretty much considering almost all these tips/suggestions. I ate fish today for the last time...starting tonight, strict fiber diet, then Wednesday, clear liquids only diet. After surgery on surgery day, continue liquids diet, and want to stick to clear liquids diet at least until Sunday. Sunday I would start strict fiber diet along with lots of liquids.So, will see how it all goes. All in God's hands and hoping pain is manageable especially 1st week, heheheh.Thanks again for taking time in reading this. Any questions/comments/feedback is greatly appreciated - thanks in advance By the way, will post Part 4 shortly after surgery day hopefully some time by the end of this week "

I want to share my experience so people can understand that it isn't always as grim as google makes out.I had 3 hemorrhoids removed last Thursday 18th May 2017, I live in Australia and this is my experience.. I went in for surgery as a public patient at about 5pm, came out and upon waking i was in a bit of pain and found it hard to get comfortable, the nurses gave me a fentanyl drip so I could press the button to boost my dose every 5 mins if needed. After I wore that out i was put on 3 antibiotics a day, 2 Targin daily, 10mg of endone every 4 - 5 hours as well as ibuprofen and panadol and the occasional fentanyl injection. I also need to take fybogel and Lactulose twice daily for soft stools for 6 weeks. I was made aware that I had a sponge of some sort up my rectum and that i'd been given a nerve block to stop pain for 12 - 24 hours. I wont lie, once the nerve block wore off I was in massive amounts of pain, i dreaded pooing and couldn't sit on my bottom at all, i basically laid there on one side staring at the wall as i couldnt move much at all. I was discharged from the hospital on the Saturday (Thursday being my surgery day) and basically followed the directions of the pain relief and stool softeners. I was in massive pain after i'd poo in the toilet and even then i didnt really push when i went to the toilet, i kinda just let it come out on its own, then last night i pushed the sponge out and today (day 6) i actually dont feel as bad! I know i have another 4 - 5 weeks of solid recovery but once that sponge was gone from the inside of my bum i felt a lot less pressure and pain! Today i went to get more refills of pain killers as i dont want to run out and then end up in pain again but i dont feel as if i need them any where near as much as I did which is fantastic! I can see the light from the end of the tunnel abd a huge difference between yesterday and today. I wanted readers to know that yes it does hurt initially but the pain does ease and to my surprise 6 days in i'm feeling much better It is worth doing if you have reoccurring hemorrhoid problems - it does hurt but dont always go off what google says as my experience is different to a lot of those I've read about prior to having surgery.. Good luck with your procedures and just know its worth it. "

It is affecting my life and I have to plan around them. I've read so many scary stories on here that I'm really debating if it's worth just continuing to deal with the roids or taking the plunge to get them removed.My daily routine revolves around having a BM at night which is about 25 minutes and then another 20+ minutes of waiting for the discharge/blood to slow down...then I bundle up a wad of toilet paper and try to get to sleep. Sometimes having to get up to swap the TP due to soaking through..sorry TMI. It's rather hard to walk after a BM so that's why I time it at night so i can go right to bed after. FYI I never have the urge to go. I'm not exactly constipated I just don't ever feel the urge. There have been phases of extreme pain that kept me up for hours after a BM and requiring a sitz bath but lately it's mostly just uncomfortable after a BM. Then by the next morning I'm almost back to normal and the cycle repeats.I've had banding multiple times with little effect. My GP has recommended surgery but I can't bring myself to it. It's hard to plan for months of downtime especially in the summer months I'd like some opinions on what to do. Thank you in advance!"

"Piles","Any idea?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/any-idea--591481","Male. Early 20'sSo I have this feeling of there being something in my lower rectum/anus. It feels swollen, that's the only way I can explain it. It's always there but it feels noticeably worse if say for example I've been sitting down for a long time. I'm almost certain I have Piles because I've seen them in the mirror. Symptoms I experience;Constant ""pressure"" in the rectum.When urinating I feel it more. So pushing to urinate it feels like it's pressing up against something. Even just laying down or walking around I feel as though there is just something there. The closest thing I can describe it to is a sensation of swelling, almost like it's swollen.Slightly harder to go number 2. Like I have to push harder. Even though stool is soft.Things I don't have;I don't bleed at any time, even during Bowel movements.I don't have any pain.I'm just wondering what this could be. I'm thinking it may be internal Hemorrhoids. I'm just wondering what anyone here thinks. Of course the best thing to do is get checked by a doctor which I will do, but in the mean time any thoughts or if someone had something similar I would appreciate it if you could shed some light on the topic.

My name's Michelle and this is part 7 of My Hemorrhoidectomy Journey posts. Please feel free to read parts 1-6 of My Hemorrhoidectomy Journey to see what has led me up to this point, why and how. Any questions or comments is always greatly appreciated - thanks in advance POD 12:Tuesday, May 9, 2017.Today has been an ok day. I spent most of the day in tolerable pain until around 6-7ish pm, had a bowel movement. Of course, afterburn pain began. Rest of the evening was in lots of pain, and I don't recall exactly what time I fell asleep, but I do remember waking up several times during night, but that has been the usual these last several days. I didn't take a pain pill until the late evening hours.POD 13:Wednesday, May 10, 2017.Today was Mother's Day for most of the Hispanic Community, so to all the mamas out there, Feliz Dia de las Madres! Painwise, today was more painful than yesterday because I had a BM in the morning after kids left to school. The afterburn pain was pretty annoying, but surprisingly not as bad as it usually gets. It eventually calmed a bit down without doing anything to relieve pain. Wow. It came down to tolerable level, then a couple hours later, another bm happened during early evening houra, and that time the afterburn pain was much worse than the afterburn from the day's first bm. From there, painwise, the rest of the evening was a lot like yesterday. Oh well...On a bright note, husband & kids surprised me with a huge teddy bear & beautiful rose for Mother's Day. Very grateful as this sweet, sweet gesture did lighten up my day quite a bit POD 14:Thursday, May 11, 2017.It has been exactly 2 weeks since surgery day. Today honestly has been one of the worst. One of those days that got me down quite a bit, both physically & emotionally. Made me really wonder if this is really getting better?I had a BM shortly before noon. The afterburn after that bm was quite unbearable, to the point that I cried and just preferred to sleep it off as much as I could rather than deal with it because NOTHING would relieve the awful burning, throbbing, achy pain. I finally just took a couple of Advil PM around 1pm, and although it took a long time, I eventually did manage to somehow fall asleep around 3pm. The pain didn't let me sleep completely without waking up a couple times every now and then, but I did manage to sleep the rest of the day, and thanks to sleep, was pain free for the most part.POD 15:Friday, May 12, 2017.Today is my 2nd newborn's birthday. Israel is turning 7 yrs old, thank God. Very Blessed to have him - Happy Birthday, Israel! I'm also glad to say that today doesn't compare to yesterday. I was up since 3:30am. Painwise, do feel a bit better, although there was a point early afternoon that it seemed to be getting bad, but managed to take a short nap (I guess for not having the best night sleep) and when I woke up, pain was tolerable again. Too bad period started today, so now at times it feels like double the bleeding down there. Sorry, tmi...Thankfully, after kids got home from school, Sister-in-law came by & took kids out for a bit to celebrate his birthday.I had another bm early evening, and again, terrible afterburn pain, but at least not as bad as yesterday.POD 16:Saturday, May 13, 2017.Pain today was tolerable for most of the day. Can't say the same for the evening part of the day After had bm around 7, felt terrible as usual afterwards. Unfortunately, a lot like Thursday's afterburn pain. My husband suggested cold towels to help cope with pain. Tried it, and yes, it does help quite a bit, but unfortunately, not for long. In addition, I ended up taking 2 hydrocone pills along with stool softener. I finally fell asleep past 1am.POD 17:Sunday, May 14, 2017.Happy Mother's Day to all the mommies out there! Today has felt like a roller coaster for the most part. Woke up with pain, but not extreme. Shortly after breakfast, had a bm. Awful burning pain didn't delay. Took a tramadol pill along with stool softener and husband gave me a very cold towel to help with pain. It did calm down quite some that I even managed to fall asleep for a couple hours. When I woke up, the bad pain seemed to have come back. At that point, towel was no longer working, and it was too early to take another pain med. So, for the time being just dealt with it. It wasn't tolerable, but wasn't extreme either, walking was too painful, so just tried to distract myself with phone, puzzle book, etc. Thankfully, it eventually calmed down on its own and got to tolerable level again. I doubt I'll have anymore BMs for today, honestly, I hope not because I always dread bms, especially the afterburn part Day is almost over here, already nightfall, so this is the end of POD 17 **On a side note, wanted to explain/specify some things that I didn't really mention above...I'm always in pain more matter what, whether it be extreme or tolerable, it's always there. When I say tolerable, it doesn't necessarily mean low, lol..just that it's to a point that it's not that bad and I can deal with it. I've even gotten used to it, so it's ok, and will take that anytime over the really bad/extreme levels of pain that usually happen after bms.I am still walking somewhat like a penguin, lol, and when the pain is really bad/extreme, walking is pretty unbearable which is when I avoid walking or even moving at all. When pain is ok/tolerable level are the times when I do walk around house a bit. My husband is still doing everything for the most part, and prefers that I still don't do anything. I do something every now and then when needed, for example, change our youngest boy's diaper. I also do little things whenever, like pick up some trash, or help wash youngest kids' hands. Unless walking/moving is really painful, I don't like to be completely useless even though my husband prefers I do nothing until I'm completely ok, heheheh. Is possible, he prefers I still spent lots of time in bed. He has been completely supportive and sweet about the whole situation. Has been spoiling me as well. Sometimes I think he is overdoing it. Amazing! So Blessed to have him My diet for the last several days have consisted mainly of fiber cereals, some jello, chicken soup, chicken with beans and rice, some eggs, fruits & veggies, and lots of water, juice and some soy milk.I still have rectal bleeding, but mainly when I have the bms. What I have noticed a lot these last several days is an increase in rectal discharge. Seems a lot like mucous. Not sure still how normal this may be.I am still using baby wipes to clean up after using toilet whether it be pee or poo. After bm, I always wash up down there using hot water. This will either be done by using a water bottle to wash up down there or sometimes I just jump into a hot shower immediately after bm. I still apply hem analgesic cream in hopes that it might do something with pain, but it never really does whatsoever relieve pain, yet I think it helps a tad bit with itching down there because I have had lots of itching in the surgery site for several days now. Another thing that helps a bit with itching are the baby wipes.Every day I still have 1-2 pain meds of some type, whether it be tramadol, hydrocone, or advil pm, and about 3-4 stool softeners throughout the day. Also, sometimes I get nauseated, and take a meclizine for that and in the mornings, always take levothyroxine for thyroids.The pain level during bowel movements these last several days have varied. For the most part over the last several days, they have been tolerable. So far, there has not been a pain-free bm since surgery. But there have been many that have been tolerable pain wise. There have also been a few that have been very painful, and there have been some that have been quite intense in addition to pain, therefore leaving me shaken and a bit weakened afterwards. I have bled with each one as well no matter the pain. For most of the bms I've had the last several days, I have had to push either a lot or a little. I know, not good, but during the moment, Idk what else to do when it doesn't come out on its own. Often before and after bm, I tend to feel lots of pressure down there. On a positive note, at least I have no longer gotten constipated like last week so far...or at least I think so. For every bm time, I do my best to get into a Squatting position by using my daughter's old potty which I use to elevate my feet.As for our upcoming plans, well, we still have tickets for upcoming concert. It's to take place in less than 2wks, on the 26th. I'm really hoping to be well enough to go. It's still too painful to sit on bum, so Idk, but we'll see what happens. We moved the kids' birthday party to June 3rd. Part of it is due to financial reasons, and the other part is to give me more time to heal. That is the official date for their birthday party, clowns have been reserved, and this week will reserve catering and bounce house as well I have followup appt with colorectal surgeon on the 26th as well. Wonder how that will go. And one day before, have school Advising appt, so hoping I'm well enough to attend that appt as well so I am able to continue school later this year.That's it for now. Will post Part 8 sometime next week. Thank you so much for taking your time to read. Any questions/comments/feedback/tips is always greatly appreciated - thanks in advance. Take care & God Bless "

Feel free to read My Hemorrhoidectomy Journey (Part 1) to see what has led me up to this point. My Hemorrhoidectomy surgery was originally scheduled for April 28th, 2017, but this week it has officially been moved to the 27th of April, so only one day difference.On part 1, in addition to sharing my feelings, I also briefly mentioned some of my plans about how to prepare for this day. Today is April 8, 2017 meaning less than 3 weeks to go and this is what has happened so far...Last Friday I started getting some type of stomach virus, so since then, I haven't really eaten much...mostly salads and soups. A couple days ago, I started taking some pills that my primary dr had prescribed for tummy, so since then, trying to eat more, but still kind of hard to finish whole meals, so just taking it one day at a time. Since that sickness got in the way, kind of derailed some things, heheheh. But some exciting news for us is that we're going to take a mini ""Spring Getaway"" this upcoming weekend to just get away from it all. Will be nice to get away with family before surgery day, heheheh. Going to L.A, my favorite city and the only other major city I know so far Now, seriously, since we just did our grocery shopping, starting Monday, the 10th, I will increase my fruit intake to at least 2 fruits a day, and continue eating salads several times each week. I'm already eating a lot less meat due to being sick, but I plan to cut out red meats completely for over a month about 10 days before the surgery, which would mean no more red meats starting on April 17th. What do you guys think about that? That part doesn't seem that challenging anymore since I'm barely eating meats now But I still have to increase water plus fiber intake plus get back on laxatives because I stopped taking them when I started getting sick last week. I'll start with 1 laxative a day for now, and increase to 2 laxatives a day one week before the procedure. I hope this will help me have less painful BMs after surgery day. I also plan to start to implement yogurt in my diet this week.As for family plans, well, I just shared with you about our little getaway next weekend. Then, before the 27th, going to start getting birthday party supplies for my kids' birthday party which we moved to May 27th instead of May 20th. Kids are understanding with moving it one week. Also, my husband is making arrangements with one of our neighbor friends to come and ""babysit"" me and help clean house just a bit maybe once a week during the first 3 weeks or so after the surgery and my husband will pay her for her work and time.I think that's it for now. I'm probably forgetting something, but can't remember now. I'll post Part 3 to My Hemorrhoidectomy Journey most likely after we get back from our little getaway to L.A. about how everything's going and anymore plans I may have in preparing for the 27th. I feel like I'm in a way nesting, lol.I'm still very nervous, but I know that in my case since other methods didnt work, it's for the best.Thanks again so much for reading this, and if you have any questions/comments/feedback/suggestions of any type, please feel free to share them with me - thank you so much in advance!

I am 28 years old, athlete my whole life and no medical conditions except some acid reflux. A couple of days ago I had diarrhea after eating something that didn't agree with me. At the tail end of the diarrhea, after pushing and straining for a while, there was a small amount of bright red blood on the toilet paper when I wiped. Obviously, I freaked out, called my doctor, who advised it sounded like a hemorrhoid and told me to up my fiber intake. He also said if it persists for more than a couple of weeks, he might do a Flexible sigmoidoscopy2 days passed with no blood when I wiped. Then I had a bowel movement where I strained quite a bit and a tiny amount of blood was once again visible on the toilet paper. Another 2 days passed where it was fine with no blood, but today there was blood again. It is very little amount of bright red blood. I also have a burning sensation after I have a bowel movement and some itching.A couple of years ago, I bled after a bowel movement and went to the ER, they checked for blood in the stool, which there was none, and told me it was either a anal fissure or hemorrhoid.I'm very irritated around my anal opening and it's driving me crazy not knowing what's going on.

I have been booked for a camera in 8 weeks time and his only advice was to change everything about my lifestyle (time to give up all indulgences yay).It has not stopped bleeding, and even walking from my local supermarket left me having to wash my anus as well as changing my underwear again.My question is, how long will it take for the bleeding to stop, and is there anything I can do to help stop the bleeding as in my current state I don't want to leave my bed let alone face the prospect of work. I live in the UK so luckily healthcare is free, however I am open to home remedies as well.Thank you."

My anus is very swollen and tender, but there is no itching or bleeding. I got some OTC cream but it's not helping...same with a warm bath and using wipes instead of tissue. I would feel silly going to the doctor for this, especially because I don't have a trusted GP, and my ""lady"" doctor says it's not their problem. Can you even have a hemorrhoid without itching? The pain is unbelievable, and comparable to the level of pain associated with my c sections. So what should I do? And do you have anything that works for you?

The straighter I stood, the worse it stung.I called up a doctor after the weekend for an appointment at a Gastroenterologist as soon as possible which was yesterday. He tells me that I need it taken care of (though he seems to have ignored--after I told him--the now-minimized mounds at the front of my anus). He recommends me to the surgeon in the same building who looks and says, ""Eh, it's not that bad. I wouldn't recommend surgery; try a steroid cream.""Well, that night I had a bowel movement and OMG! The twin peaks came roaring back and that irritation turned mad! I called a doctor while at work for an immediate appointment with a surgeon with a better rating. He takes the time to actually looks and spread em and says, ""Well theres not much you can do in here for this, and these aren't going away on there own. You have a grade 4 prolapse incarcerated internal hemorrhoid, which is what is giving you the pain right now. This is going to die off on its own, but it could take a long time.

Baths and ebson salts were my retreat. I ran out of pain killers on day 5 and of course it is a long weekend. I was going to call my doctor on day 6, a Monday to get refills. That night, another can't sleep, can't pee and so much pain kind of night I decided to try my Advil Arthritis Pain pills. OMG!! I awoke with the I have to pee but why try feeling.

They were a god send, but do constipate you. I limited my usage of them. I'd take two in the morning and two at night. I could definitely feel amazing effects of them. They'd take away the pain within 20 minutes. Lactulose. I took 10mls twice a day. Glycerine suppositories. Day 4 after the op, I called the GP as I'd not been to the toilet properly. She suggested these (£1.10 over the counter at the pharmacy). I still use these to help me go. I'm 16 days post op. A stool to rest your feet on when you try to go to the toilet. It puts your body in a better position apparently. Hairdryer to dry yourself after a wash. You'll not want to rub it. Hot bath after a poo. It'll save you a lot of pain. Start running it as you hop on the toilet. Moist toilet wipes. Prune juice. Flax seeds. All bran. Emla. I've only just stopped using this. It numbs the area after using the toilet. I used it before going to, but found it eased the discomfort after. Lots and lots of water. "

I was on and off the toilet for 3 hours that day. I could barely walk or move for 2 days after. It hurt so bad. On day 7 I guess I had fecal impaction. I was on the toilet all day because I kept feeling the urge to go but only a tiny bit came out each time, and it felt like I was pooping out the moon with razors. So that night I got in the tub, and I had to just stick my finger up there and get it out, and then the rest followed. Gosh it was awful... I felt so much relief. Well the next day, the miralax I had been taking everyday finally caught up with me so I had diarrhea all day long. So so painful. Burning and stinging sensation, and like I was being ripped open by the devil himself. On day 8 I stopped taking all pain medicine so that I wouldn't get constipated. Day 9 was still painful to go, and I was going at least 4 times a day. Day 10 and 11 was getting better. Day 12 I felt like a normal human being. I could sit and walk and do normal things again. BM's still hurt a tiny bit if they are kinda hard but if they are soft then I don't feel any pain but some discomfort. Still go a few times a day. I'm on day 13, and feel great! I've gone to the bathroom 2 times so far, and no pain but slight discomfort on the first BM of the day. What I found to really help is, getting on top of the toilet seat and squatting over it. If I sit on the toilet seat then it hurts pretty badly! Stool softeners are life savers!!! Don't get a laxative. Sitz baths are amazing. I took so many during that first week. I don't need them anymore. I still use wipes and tucks pads. That first week was miserable and so painful. I fully regretted the surgery. Sometimes I laid in the bath tub after a BM and was just wanting to die rather than bear the pain. I'm glad my hemorrhoids are gone but I don't think it was worth it to go through that. My hemorrhoids weren't bad enough to go through something so torturous. I would only recommend doing it if it's seriously a medical problem like bleeding to death, can't poop because of it, or very very very bad. Make sure you cleanse your bowels before surgery because my surgeon didn't make me do that so my first BM was like 5 days worth, that's why I was on the toilet for 3 hours. Just remember to breathe, know you will get through it, it does get better! I'm one of the lucky ones I think because mine weren't so bad because I have read many people don't heal and stop feeling pain until 6-8 weeks. I would recommend taking at least 2-3 weeks off work. I went back on day 9 for a full day. Like I said, I got lucky to heal so quick and soon. So a little back ground first.. I have had 8 previous surgeries, and have given birth before I decided to get this surgery done. After I gave birth, I got hemorrhoids. I had several internal prolapsed hemorrhoids that would end up causing severe pain but eventually burst on their own, and I was left with skin tags. Well for 2 years straight I've had an Internal prolapsed one that would come and go off and on that bothered me and itched. So I decided to get the surgery done! I never did research for the recovery or look up anyone else's experience, (wish I did). Well I had my surgery on 8/30/16 so tomorrow will be two weeks since my surgery. My doctor prescribed me Percocet and Valium for afterwards, and she injected a numbing medicine down there so that I wouldn't feel the pain for 3 days.

"Piles","haemorrhoidectomy-best decision made - positive experience sharing","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/haemorrhoidectomy-best-decision-made-positive-experience-sharing-532831","Hi guys I recently went through a haemorrhoidectomy and had great results. I've been reading lots of dicussions and notes on this site before the surgery so I decided to give back by sharing my experience. I am 22 y.o female, had piles since school days but not servere. Since started working, I had three bad times, each time it took longer to heal. This time it took me 3 weeks to heal so I decided to see a surgeon. I had the best surgeon in the city (I am based in Australia) and gave me advice to do an open surgery during my first consult. I booked in the surgery on the day for 10 days later.So today is Day 19 after surgery (2 weeks and a bit), I am 100% now. I had 2 piles removed, one internal and one external. The operation took less than 30min and I was asleep for an hour. Woke up perfectly and decided to stay in the hospital overnight. I am a big worrier and very bad at pain endurance so the pain part post operation scared the hell out of me when I was reading stuff online. However this is my experience here. PAIN throughout the recovery period was absolutely MANGEABLE. I survived by taking paracetamol- standard dose. The anaesthetic lasted about 8 hours and the soreness started to kick in - but it was totally bearable - nothing like I imagined before. I didn't even need to take any painkillers but the nurse suggested to take some paracetamol to manage before it gets worse so I took 2 tablets 12 after the surgery. Worst part on the surgery day was my reaction to anaesthetic. Threw up twice and couldn't eat anything and I had to have 2 injects for nausea. But it was normal according to my surgeon. Woke up much better and had something to eat the next morning and went home. So now, the most IMPORTANT part -- RECOVERY. Trust me, it is not as scary as you guys all imagined. I had a great surgeon who did a fantastic job - it made my recovery so much easier. 7 days was what I needed to get back to normal life. When I say NORMAL LIFE, I mean cooking, going to work, being able to sit properly, having proper meals with proteins and everything, going for a jog, shopping, and most importantly, having BM without much pain. 7 DAYS! So don't be afraid of recovery, trust me it's not as bad. Alright, some details now. Had first BM one day after the surgery. Scared to death but wasn't as bad. Nothing like passing blades etc, but it was a bit hard at first cos I needed to strain and was scared to break the stiches. But managed to do it in the end, manageable pain and of course I took paracetamol before I went to toilet. Main thing in the first few days was the heaviness and swelling which stopped from standing for too long and sitting. I pretty much stayed in bed most of the time in the first 2-3 days. And diet, I controlled my diet strictly by having only salads. Rice and carbohydrate is bad. No meat in the first week. It helped when having BM. I walked funny during first week but perfectly fine in the second week. Like all the others, sitting in warm water helps after BM. To make it even worse, I had my period the second day after surgery so ... no sitz bath for me but a lot of shower the first week. Pain after BM peaked on Day 6 and 7 somehow - I imagined this is when the healing started. After day 7, it was perfectly find and reduced dramatically. No pain post BM after Day 9. So some key dates here to give you an idea.- I stopped all medicines (painkiller + stool sofener) on day 7. I was never able to time the painkillers before BM properly...not sure if it ever worked.. Make sure you eat lots of fibre after you stop stool softener. Wait for the urge to go to toilet (really important). Would be good if you can go to toilet at specific time regularly. - There is a bit of mucus (light yellow, no smell) from Day 3/4. It's NORMAL (I called my surgeon and asked). It lasted just over 2 weeks for me. Heavy swelling from 1st BM is normal. It reduces overtime. An external pile looking thing is NORMAL - it is the swelling and again, reduces over time. I have a tiny one still now but will disappear soon i hope. - Started driving on Day 7- First day out (grocery shopping) on Day 6, walked a bit funny but who cares .. I was so excited to get out of the house- Bleeding and pain after BM stopped after Day 8/9. Pain during daytime is minimal after Day 5/6 - can start walking around freely then. - First run (2.5km) on Day 16 (just over 2 weeks). It's important to get your stamina back. I struggled a bit cos I haven't been eating properly. - First week the swelling is the worst (even visually...I tried to look). But started to reduce dramatically from second week. I started apply proctocydl (as suggested by my surgeon) from Day 5 to reduce swelling, it helped! - Installed by new digital bidet on Day 11, best thing ever! Strongly recommend it to ALL ..yes everyone who has or has not haemorrhoids, had or had not surgeries ...best thing ever!Can't think of anymore at this stage, but will post more if I remember more. Any questions, let me know ! Totally happy to share my experience on it. Remember, keep a diary of all your experience and progresses and share!! Best decision I made this year ever, to get rid of this annoying problem!!! Should have done it way earlier!!! Positive experience!!"
"Piles","hemorrhoidectomy Surgery recovery anyone else felt good after?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hemorrhoidectomy-surgery-recovery-anyone-else-felt-good-after--531546","Hey everyone! So yesterday I had my hemorrhoidectomy surgery done, going into the surgery I had no idea what they were planning on doing exactly i didn't care either I just wanted something done. A little about my situation. I had a massive skin tag which also had a hemorrhoid attached at the base which was situated at the entrance (skin tag was that big it became exterior) that I could not get rid of, I've had this for about 4 + years at first it was nothing bad but after falling pregnant and carrying it became very enlarged. Also struggling with IBS my whole life I found it hard to control it and would also have other haemorrhoids pop up here and there but cream would fix it. I never had bleeding that I noticed.I got to the point where this skin tag and hemorrhoid was ruining my life. I felt gross and never wanted to have sex with my partner because I thought it was disgusting.So after all this time I decided it was time to do something and surgery was my option. After booking it in I decided to research the operation .... Biggest mistake! So many horror stories and I almost chickened out. But I figured I had to do something! Waking up from surgery I felt great just a little tired but no pain. After getting home I read all my surgery details and found out they had removed the skin tag and a hemorrhoidectomy on the attached hemorrhoid, I also had a rubber band on an internal one. I didn't want to look down there I seen the pics on the net and was so scared. I took the bandage off that contained the aniseptic earlier then I should of. I felt numb down there when wiping from doing a pee (so glad I could pee!) I felt the area with my finger and to my surprise it felt normal minus the skin tag and after having a quick look I was impressed. It's now 24 hours since surgery and I've had very limited pain only sharp jolts here and there when my pain killers are starting to wear off. I am taking ibuprofen 400mg and Panadol taking alternative every 4 hours. I'm also on a liquid laxative and stool softeners along with Metamucil and flaxseed oil tablets which I started taking prior to surgery. I am yet to have a bowel movement and I'm pretty scared about that it sometimes feels like I got to go but it's just gas. But with all the pressure I think it makes it feel like I need to go. I'm up and walking around even doing some cleaning but taking it easy. I'm really hoping this continues and crossing fingers my bowel movement is not horrific as the ones I've read about. I'm staying positive! Anyone else had this surgery and felt as good as I have ? Does it stay this good? Or am I just getting my hopes up. "

"Piles","Haemorrhoidectomy - sharing the experience","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/haemorrhoidectomy-sharing-the-experience-497818","I thought I'd share my experiences of a recent haemorrhoidectomy, in the hope that they may be useful to others. I've certainly appreciated the accounts of others who have kindly shared their thoughts. My problems with haemorrhoids date back some 20 years. In the past decade I've had two treatments of injection which have provided only temporary relief. Having concluded I was thoroughly tired of the inconvenience and discomfort of prolapsing haemorrhoids, I got myself booked in for surgery. As you’ll see below, my operation removed three haemorrhoids. I am, by the way, male and in my mid-forties and I keep myself in reasonable shape (regular gym goer) and have a good fibre and nutrition rich diet. I live in the South East of England and had the operation in a private hospital with a surgeon who’d operated on me earlier in the year to repair bilateral inguinal hernias. Day Zero (Monday) I was out of the ward for approaching two hours. The surgeon had told me the procedure would take between 20 to 45 minutes depending on what he found. Seems like, in my case, it was closer to 20 minutes. I'd been told that they'd want to keep me in for three hours after the op and ensure that I'd managed to eat and drink and go for a pee. Having been nil-by-mouth since 0800, once the usual grogginess of the anaesthetic had cleared, I was guzzling water and it wasn't long before I felt like eating. After having consumed what seemed like endless glasses of water, I finally felt like peeing. Getting out of bed for the first time after an op (I've had a few over the years) is always a little daunting but I felt okay if a little light headed. Standing by the loo and with a little concentration, the pee flowed. Uncontrollably, I also passed some wind which was accompanied by splattered drops of blood. The nurse didn't seem phased by this, saying it was perfectly usual. She said I could expect to pass blood for a few days on bowels movements. Apparently I also had a dressing inserted (cylindrical packing) which would probably pop out the first time I went to the loo. They gave a pile of gauze dressings to put inside my underwear to protect from the blood spotting that I was told to expect. So off I went home. I was aware that the local anaesthetic would wear off something after like 12 hours so, although I felt reasonably comfortable at that time, I was rather fearing what was to come. I'd been warned (by the consultant, in particular) to expect a lot of pain. I was given a supply of ibuprofen and cocodamol (paracetamol and codeine combined into a single tablet). Codeine of course can (and likely will) cause constipation, which is really the last thing you need at a time like this. So I resolved to avoid it if at all possible. For reasons unknown, I'd been suffering for several days from trapped wind and generally feeling bloated. Not a comfortable condition at the best of times and certainly rather inconvenient post operatively. Passing wind in such circumstances is something that requires care; invariably, some liquid is also passed so conducting the procedure sitting on the loo is essential. To my frustration, I needed to repeat several times. I took ibuprofen and went to bed and eventually dropped off to sleep. I had to get up around four times during the night to pee. I think I was unable to fully empty my bladder perhaps due to the after effects of the anaesthetic and probably because I was feeling sore and being ultra-careful. Day 1 (Tuesday) I awoke and felt reasonably comfortable and relieved that, so far at least, the anticipated intense pain hadn't materialised. I wasn't looking forward to the first bowel motion, however. By all accounts, that's when the pain really kicks in. I'm usually very regular in the morning but I'm guessing a combination of having been nil-by-mouth and anaesthetic had slowed things down. I sat on the loo and all that happened was mostly wind. I think the dressing popped out. It was either that or a very thin and regularly shaped stool, which I rather doubt. I gingerly wiped up (thank goodness for moist toilet wipes). In a while, I showered (which provided the chance to clear up rather more thoroughly). For the rest of the day, I took some pain relief (ibuprofen and paracetamol; no codeine). Much of the discomfort came from the aforementioned trapped wind. Eventually I caved in and took a tablet to treat this, but it didn't have much of an effect. The remainder of the day was uneventful. I ate plenty of fruit and a surprisingly hearty dinner (which included lots of veg). There was the occasional wind-breaking operation, after which I needed to clean up using the moist wipes as some blood was passed; I was glad of the underwear protecting gauze. I should also mention I placed old towels everywhere I sat, plus on my bed, just in case of heavy leakage. As bed time approached, the wind episodes increased in frequency. Each a minor procedure in itself, as previously described. After going to bed, it became particularly frustrating. It seemed that as soon as I lay down, my bowel dispensed a pocket of air downwards. I'm not sure about you, but wind pressing up against the anal sphincter is never comfortable (maybe haemorrhoids had been making that worse? I guess I'll find out) and especially so after surgery to the anal canal. So I'd pop off to the loo for the usual wind passing rigmarole. Back into bed. Within seconds, the same intolerable feeling. Cutting a long story short, this went on for an hour. I must have run-around that loop at least 10 times. I was starting to get a little desperate. How much air can one (slim) abdomen hold? A surprisingly large amount, it turns out. I'd love to know how much air I passed. It must have been a good litre or two. It was, by the way, the foulest smelling flatulence I can recall experiencing. Maybe that's what happens when you have decomposing blood added to the usual contents of a bowel. After what seemed like an age, all wind was passed and I dropped into a good sleep. Day 2 (Wednesday) I woke feeling comfortable. The wind issue was no more, I was relieved to discover. I did, however, feel like my bowel regularity was likely to reassert itself. I took ibuprofen and paracetamol, even though I had little or no pain. I was anticipating the widely reported agony of a bowel movement and I was anxious to soften the blow as much as possible. The time came and I kept in mind two things I'd picked up from the posts of others: Remember to breathe. A bowel movement should be involuntary. With regard to risk factors for suffering the onset of piles, I'd always considered myself to be in good shape. I have a good diet and, I thought at least, I didn't strain when going to the loo. I now realise that over the years I'd fallen into the habit of adding a conscious push. Allowing it to just happen is a really important tip; for everyone and in particular, for those who have just had a haemorrhoidectomy. So I sat and waited for nature to take its course and braced myself for pain. Things started to move and a few stools of reasonable size dropped out. So far so good and while not particularly comfortable, it wasn't as painful as feared and no blood in the pan. It felt like there was more coming so I sat and waited. This is where in the past I'd have been tempted to have pushed. I think it's my busy lifestyle: I'm always in a hurry and I've probably habitually tried to speed up everything in life. Turns out that then it comes to going to the loo, patience is a virtue. Some things just can't be rushed. Another involuntary motion came. It was uncomfortable but not particularly painful although my bottom was starting to smart. It was similar to the feeling one gets after a particularly unpleasant bout of diarrhoea; a distinctly sore feeling. I remembered to be patient and once I was sure that that was it, I cleaned up (those moist toilet wipes where once again a godsend). Others have said they've sat in a shallow bath (perhaps containing salt) but I didn't much fancy that. Instead, after a while, I had a cleansing shower. The remainder of the day was uneventful and reasonably comfortable. The advice is to keep the area clean so I took another shower before bed. I slept well although I awoke during the night to pee and was a disappointed to discover my bottom was still weeping a slightly bloody liquid. Clearly gauze underwear protection was still necessary. I also became aware of some external swelling. I started wondering if the surgeon had left a pile in place and that I was inevitably destined for further surgery. After a while, I put it down to a case of pre-dawn anxiety and resolved to wait and see. Day 3 (Thursday) Not long after I awoke I felt the need for the toilet. With the golden rules in mind of remembering to breathe and not adding conscious muscular effort, I headed for the bathroom, mentioning to my wife that I may be some time. This time, progress was slow and frankly, quite painful. Not excruciating but not at all pleasant. Each involuntary push was accompanied by a stinging sensation and punctuated by a few minutes of inactivity. Before now, my impatience would have kicked in and encouraged me to push in an attempt to speed things up. This time, however, I was aware of the need to let nature take its course in its own time. So I sat it out, although I found that standing (carefully!) seemed to encourage the next round of contractions (although perhaps that was just my imagination) each accompanied by a steadily increasing stinging. After about 45 minutes, the task was complete and I had that sense that there was no more to come. I wiped carefully (the ring was really quite sore and swollen) and got straight in the shower, to complete the clean up. Taking a shower is generally a pleasure and this occasion was certainly no exception. I felt quite drained and a little faint. Figuring I needed to up my blood sugar, I had porridge and a vitamin and glucose solution. The morning was spend dozing until eventually at around midday I felt normality returning to my energy level. Throughout the day, I experienced occasional spasms. It felt like my anus was drawing in on itself, not unlike the feeling of a prolapsed haemorrhoid being drawn back in. So far I’ve taken fewer pain meds than prescribed. The routine has settled into ibuprofen, 400mg three times a day and 1000mg paracetamol just once in the morning, in anticipation of a bowel movement. Advice is to keep the area clean so I took a shower before bed. I was still using gauze as an underwear protector and certainly needed to, with my bottom continuing to ooze. I changed the gauze after the morning and evening showers. Day 4 (Friday) Awaking from a restful sleep, I took doses of ibuprofen and paracetamol in preparation for today’s bowel movement. I'd not long been out of bed before the urge took hold. In a post I read someplace, the writer urged caution with laxatives warning that their use could be counterproductive if you're usually regular and reasonably loose. I am, but I can tell you don't bank on this post operatively. I'd been being conservative with the Lactulose, thinking the same. Today, the motions were pretty firm and really rather painful. The whole process took an hour of perhaps 10 cycles of motion and pause. At first, a stool was in mid passing when the contractions paused which added to the discomfort. I took to standing and eventually pacing around in an attempt to encourage the next bout of motion to kick in. I must confess it was somewhat of an ordeal and it left me drained and sore. I cleaned up a bit with moist wipes, finishing the task in the shower. No blood had been evident in the bowl but there was some on the wipes. I took a glucose supplement, took a full dose of Lactulose, had some light breakfast and crashed out. My wife said I looked pale and exhausted. Three hours of dozing later, I felt rather more like myself once more. I experienced the occasional spasm while dozing, which was occasionally quite uncomfortable. Oozing continued at a similar rate to previously. As before, the ooze was bloody and smelt particularly foul. I wondered if this was normal for this stage. Day 5 (Saturday) Another day closer to recovery. I started the day with the usual dosing of paracetamol and ibuprofen, in readiness for today’s bowel motion. This came within 15 minutes of getting up and, thank goodness, was easier than yesterday. It was all over in 20 minutes and four stages. While rather uncomfortable and painful at times it was nowhere near yesterday’s excruciating experience. I felt fine afterwards, particularly after a cleansing shower and was ready to get on with the day. Pads were still necessary as my anus was still oozing a watery, bloody liquid. I noticed that it was smelling less foul now as was flatulence. I was wondering when the oozing would cease or at least slow. By this time, could imagine going back to work. I work in London but live an hour or so away. This week I’d been off sick and I’d planned to take next Monday off as holiday. Now, I could imagine getting back into the usual routine by working from home on Tuesday and perhaps going back into the office the following week. Day 6 (Sunday) It was starting to feel a little Groundhog Day-esque. Today’s bowel motion was much like yesterday’s: painful and uncomfortable and took around 30 minutes but at least wasn’t as bad as Friday’s. Although it did come at the rather inconvenient time of 0530. The formula for pain relief remained the same: ibuprofen and paracetamol to start the day, one or two re-doses of ibuprofen throughout the day (especially before bed). Oozing continues at a similar rate. It increased in the evening with more blood content. Passing wind is still rather inconvenient as it’s still accompanied by bloody liquid. I wondered whether this was normal, six days post-op; glad that I have a follow-up appointment with the surgeon on Tuesday. Day 7 (Monday) Monday was a pretty awful day, not necessarily because of ongoing recovery but because I spent around four hours in tremendous pain resulting from abdominal cramping. It eased in the afternoon but by that time I had an appointment booked with my GP so I went along anyhow in case the problem returned. He had a feel of my belly and decided it was probably due to bowel spasms, prescribing Buscopan (hyoscine butylbromide). I took two straightaway and decided to only take more if I felt a hint of cramping (I didn’t). Day 8 (Tuesday) I saw the surgeon for the first post-op follow-up; he was pleased with progress. He told me he’d removed three piles, each with an incision of around 2cm. He said I could expect oozing to continue for four to six weeks post-op. He thought that my recovery was being aided by showering after a motion and again before bed i.e. making every effort to keep the area as clean as possible. Bowel motions are getting easier but are still decidedly uncomfortable. I had three today, the last of which was quite loose (I’ll cut down on the Lactulose). I did some very light work today (I'm office based and can work from home). I guess it totalled 30 minutes or so, but felt like a good start. Day 9 (Wednesday) Started to feel more like my old self today. The morning’s bowel motion was easier; still mildly painful over in a 10 minutes or so. It was preceded by a fair about of wind, which when passed was accompanied by the now usual moistness. I do look forward to once again being able to fart with impunity! I did roughly a half day’s work and felt reasonably productive. Day 10 (Thursday) Another good day. Did what amounted to a full day’s work and was productive. Still taking ibuprofen and paracetamol, of course. Day 11 (Friday) Challenging day today. My bowel decided to move at 3am, so I went through the usual rigmarole. The stools were pretty firm resulting in a more painful experience than of late. I’d just finished up the whole process and got back in bed and lo and behold, the urge to move came within a minute of laying down. So back to the bathroom to repeat, including showering. All told I lost 90 minutes of sleep and when I finally got back into bed I was rather sore and had occasional spasms, which resulted in poor quality sleep. I was up again at 0700 with another similarly uncomfortable motion. At 0930, motion number four came along. Bowel motions at this time certain rule one’s life: I had to postpone a conference call at late notice due to the last one. So, in short, a disrupted night and a tough day of feeling tired. I still managed to get a good day’s work in, however, and I think I was reasonably productive. I was really starting to look forward to being fully healed and yet, that felt like it was still some way off. Hoping tomorrow is better. Day 12 (Saturday) A good day today. The morning’s bowel movement had a hint of normality about it. If previously, they’ve peaked on the pain scale at around eight and settled on average to around four, today’s was at perhaps two on the scale. I felt quite energetic, easily managing a 5km walk in the afternoon. I wore my fitness band for the first time since the op and clocked up 13,000 steps during the day Day 13 (Sunday) This morning’s bowel movement was a little more challenging than yesterday’s but still not too bad. A little firmer and I’d say it was around three on the pain scale. Needless to say the discharge continues but overall the indications are encouraging. I still require more sleep than usual; I’m not feeling the need to nap but nine hours during the night seems to be what I need right now. Day 14 (Monday) More progress today in that I dipped my toe into a return to commuting to work. I went into London for a meeting, albeit making life easier for myself by having my wife drop me off and pick me up from the local railway station and by getting taxis to/from the venue in London. I felt fine throughout and didn’t suffer any ill effects. Although it was touch and go as to whether I’d make it; it was all down to whether the morning’s bowel movement would be over in time. It was, just (and not too uncomfortable at perhaps “two” on the pain scale). This came after a false start having been awoken at 4am by threatened movement, but which it turns out came to nothing. Anyhow, once the meeting was over I returned home and worked from home productively for the remainder of the day. Day 15 (Tuesday) After yesterday’s exertion I got an early night and had something like nine hours sleep. Today’s bowel movement was the closest to normality that I’ve experienced so far. At this time I’ve stopped taking Lactulose but I am, of course, still taking care to eat plenty of fibre and drinking many glasses of water per day. At this stage, the things I was looking forward to were: Being able to stop planning ahead for pain relief meds in advance of a bowel movement. I think I might be almost there. Ceasing of the weeping and no longer needing to use gauze to protect underwear. I’m guessing there are a few more weeks of this to come. Being about to pass wind without the need to mop up passed moisture. Again, this is probably a few weeks away. Day 16 (Wednesday) Boy, what a day. Turns out stopping taking Lactulose was somewhat premature. I suffered from constipation today. I must have gone to the loo nearly 20 times all told. Each time, I’d feel like my bowel was moving and a large stool was being passed but little or nothing would emerge. It was really uncomfortable: I felt like I was sitting on a hard stool, trapped in my anal canal (I’m guessing that this was indeed the case). Eventually in the mid-afternoon, I finally managed to empty my bowel and gosh what a relief it was. The good news was that little or no blood was evident throughout and the act of finally passing the stools wasn’t too painful so I think that bodes well for my general state of healing. For the remainder of the day (and indeed, night) I suffered from copious wind, which was occasionally uncomfortable but nothing in comparison to constipation. I need to get back on the Lactulose for a while, it seems, at least until my daily physical activity approaches normality. Regardless, I managed to be reasonably productive at work. I had intended to commute but changed my plan to work from home instead. In the afternoon I even managed to pull off a three hour conference call, one hour of which I took from the bathroom; I’m hoping the 15 or so other participants were none the wiser of my suffering! Day 17 (Thursday) Back to a semblance of normality today, thank goodness. Perhaps a little sore following yesterday’s onslaught of bowel motions but today’s movement was straightforward and not painful. Hopefully well on the way to being on the mend. I worked from home (having canned my intention to commute) and had a productive day. Day 18 (Friday) Usual kind of day today. Worked from home productively. All well on the bowel movement front. Day 19 (Saturday) Experienced a little more pain during this morning’s bowel movement and soreness following. I guess it’s my body reminding me that there is still a way to go in order to be fully healed. I hit my 10k step goal today, helped in part by a walk in the local woods. Day 20 (Sunday) Awoken early by the need for a bowel movement (I’d been gassy since the night before). The motion was loose (indication I need to reduce Lactulose, I think) and, a little disconcertingly, was accompanied by bleeding; perhaps as much if not more so than at any time previously. It was bright red, which I took as a good sign (i.e. it was fresh rather than having been bleeding for some time and accumulating) and curiously it stopped as quickly as it had started. The bowel motion, as usual, came in several contractions and on the next one there was no blood evident. I was rather concerned for a moment when I first saw the blood but when it quickly ceased I figured while less than ideal, that it was just part of the healing process. I decided that if it does continue I’ll call the hospital but otherwise best not worry about it. On Thursday I have a follow-up appointment with the consultant. I read that bleeding can increase around this time due to scabbing falling off; that sounds plausible so I took that as a reasonable explanation. My bottom was sorer than it had been of late; not too surprising, I guess. The road to full recovery clearly has a few bumps along the way. On reflection, I suspect I had had an abscess which broke when I went to the loo. That would explain soreness building over a day or so and the blood. Another consistent factor is that later in the day I experienced a yellowish discharge; not particularly unusual in that I’ve been seeing such since the operation but now there was rather more and it was of a gloopy consistency. Evidence of a draining abscess, perhaps. Day 21/three weeks since surgery (Monday) Here we are three weeks in and today’s bowel movement was still quite sore; specifically, I experienced sharp pains for around a minute after each motion. Once again, I was woken early by the need to go to the loo. I did so, showered, and went back to bed for 90 minutes. I had a few spasms (the first for a good few days). No blood today. Soreness continued into the day (I took both ibuprofen and paracetamol in the morning but no more beyond that) but calmed down within a few hours. Day 22 (Tuesday) Woken before the alarm by the need to visit the loo. Today was the first occasion I’d tackled a bowel motion without pain relief cover (although several times before, I’d taken tablets only five or 10 minutes before, so in such cases I doubt it had yet taken much effect); this was more by chance than design. The motions were sore once again but not too bad. Perhaps “three” on the pain scale. I thought I’d try continuing the day with no pain relief but quickly decided it made more sense to take paracetamol due to soreness. Better to be comfortable than try to be a hero (at least, prematurely!). After the now usual loo related shenanigans, I took a few work calls from home and tackled the commute to the office mid-morning. The day went well (no bowel movements, thankfully, given I’m still somewhat dependent upon showering immediately after) and was productive. There was some discomfort but not at all bad. I left the office early at just before 1700 as I felt my energy starting to wane. I felt no need for any further pain relief during the day. So all told, I felt it was a good step towards getting back to normal. As an aside, I ordered some more gauzes as my local chemist’s supply seems to have dried up, I buy non-sterile ones as they’re much cheaper and I don’t see sterility as being an issue at this stage. I used sterile pads for a few days immediately after surgery but reverted to non-sterile when the initial supply provided by the hospital ran out. No sign as yet of these no longer being necessary: still getting a watery, yellow discharge. Day 23 (Wednesday) A good day in which I distinctly felt well on the road to recovery. I commuted into London (a little later than usual, to avoid the morning rush) and felt find all day with good stamina. Today’s bowel movement was easy enough. Still getting the yellowish discharge, of course, so gauze padding is still very much necessary. I’m still taking 10ml daily of Lactulose, as a precautionary measure. Day 24 (Thursday) No pain relief taken before the bowel movement today (which was a little uncomfortable but not really painful although I had noticeable soreness afterwards). I caught myself pushing a little so definitely need to continue to be mindful as I don’t want to return to old habits: remember to let a bowel movement be a wholly involuntary action. By mid-morning I was feeling a little uncomfortable, which I was finding distracting and felt it was sapping my energy so I decided today wasn’t destined to be the first entirely pain medication free day. I felt more focused after taking paracetamol. The next milestones I look forward to are: The remaining soreness to subside and having no need at all for pain relief. Being able to comfortably clean up after a bowel movement such that I don’t feel the need to shower, and the confidence that this’ll give. Weeping to cease such that I no longer need to use gauzes. Beyond that, I still feel the need for an extra hour’s sleep than usual and of course, I look forward to getting fully back to normal and being able to do things such as go to the gym, ride my bike, etc. In the afternoon I had a follow up appointment with my surgeon. He said my recovery was going well and that the op site looks good. He reckons I shouldn’t have problems with lingering skin tags as the area “looks flat”. He said the discharge is plasma and not pus and that there’s no sign whatsoever of infection. In earlier stages of regeneration the skin is very thin and fragile and exudes plasma. The yellowish tinge is simply because of the nature of that region of the body. In short, it’s perfectly normal and of no concern. He said he’d like to see me again in five weeks at which time, with luck, he’ll discharge me from follow-up. In the meantime he said I could return to the gym so long as I was sensible and took it easy. Using the swimming pool is also no problem. As an aside, he made an interesting comment: it’s not well understood how and why the body responds so well to rectal surgery rather than developing, as one might expect, a “raging infection” (his words!). He said it’d make a productive research subject. Day 25 (Friday) Another good day, with a full day at work in the office. I walked to and from the railway station today for the first time, clocking up over 10km according to my Microsoft Band. Day 26 (Saturday) Even nearly four weeks in, bowel movements are still a little uncomfortable. But that said, today was a milestone in that it was the first that I’ve managed with no pain relief whatsoever. Day 27 (Sunday) I received a short message from my bottom this morning: “you’re not out of the woods just yet, matey”. I woke early needing the loo which turned out to be surprisingly uncomfortable for this stage of the game. In a short burst, I’d say it was pushing “four” on the pain scale accompanied by mild soreness for a few hours. It definitely felt like a throwback from a few weeks ago. The only factor I could think of was the meal I consumed on Saturday evening; I made a dish which contained a good volume of spelt, quinoa and wild rice. It’s possible this was a bit scratchy on its way out. I took two paracetamol to calm things down and got on with the day. Week commencing day 28 i.e. four weeks since surgery Recovery from Sunday’s set back took a few days in fact soreness continued throughout the week with even the occasional spasm. That said, I managed the week mostly without pain relief taking a few paracetamol or ibuprofen only here and there when I felt the discomfort was distracting. I started the week with a few days of holiday which included a trip to see relatives, a drive of five hours which I managed without a problem. I worked for the remainder of the week, two out of the three days from home. On the day I went into the office I had a dose of the runs, which was pretty inconvenient. It was the first time I’d had a bowel movement without being able to shower immediately after. The weeping continues as much as ever, necessitating continued use of gauzes. Overall, I feel like there is still some way to go and I’m not entirely sure I feel any better than I did a week ago. Week commencing day 35 i.e. five weeks since surgery A week of mixed results. I believe I have possibly developed an anal fissure. I’ve booked an interim appointment with the surgeon so I’ll find out for sure but the combination of discomfort, pain and also appearance makes me reasonably sure that that’s the problem. The pain peaked around Tuesday, with sharp stabbing pain for a few minutes following the morning bowel motion with strong and excruciating albeit brief and infrequent spasms for a further hour. Reading up on the subject, I decided that I’m possibly over-washing or more specifically, worsening the situation by the use of shower gel. Most contain sodium laureth sulphate which is reasonably unpleasant stuff at the best of times; even the so-called “sensitive” products contain it. So, from Friday, I started using just plain water on my bottom. The wand attachment in our bathroom’s shower certainly helps. I’m also taking 400mg of ibuprofen several times a day, for its anti-inflammatory properties. I ended the week feeling considerably more comfortable and, fingers crossed, am on the home run. Week commencing day 42 i.e. six weeks since surgery A mostly positive week in which the slow process of recovery continues. Just one minor setback on Wednesday, when I experienced during the morning's bowel motion a little more pain than on recent average and a few drops of blood. I was concerned I was experiencing another setback but the subsequent increase in discomfort lasted only for 24 hours. I had a follow-up appointment on Thursday with the surgeon who took a close look and assured me that the recovery was progressing satisfactorily albeit perhaps more slowly than I'd like. He said there was no evidence of a fissure developing although, yes, part of the wound had opened up (very slightly). His message was that healing will take as long as it'll take and patience is the only option. He suggested applying Vaseline as it provides a protective layer. I ended the week with little discomfort and able to operate more or less as normal. I am, however, still experiencing discharge (hence still need to use gauzes as underwear protection) and I've not yet felt sufficiently confident to venture back into the gym. From day 49, i.e. seven weeks since surgery, and the following month thereafter. The shallow recovery curve has continued with just the occasional wiggle here and there. At 11 weeks since surgery I finally feel mostly back to normal and am able to do everything I could before the operation. I do feel like there's more healing to go as I'm experiencing a few occasional minor twinges. I'm still using two (four-ply) gauzes (I was using four and was having to change them three times a day, whereas now they easily last all day) due to still experiencing just a little seeping now and then. Judging by the rate of progress, I'm expecting to be able to ditch them entirely within a week or two. Right now I continue using them just to provide a little extra confidence, if I am honest. So it's taken a while - longer than I'd expected - but I feel I'm finally out of the woods. The results are worthwhile; it wasn't a "

What most people fail to realise is the intense, rasping, drawing pain- with the post motion relaxation of the muscles I felt as if I was going to faint! I have taken to singing while on the loo- while I am singing and doing silly arm actions- I am being distracted and keeping the blood circulating. If you have read Harry Potter after dealing with the dementors then that feeling is ALMOST the same feeling- and a piece of chocolate restores the sugar levels! BUT-I have discovered that baby lotion or wipes - for very delicate and sensitive skin-are cooling (but not long lasting), unquestionably the most time consuming and embarassing part is that it is very difficult to keep clean, and post motion cleansing is painful and uncomfortable. I have taken to using vasaline to keep the area lubricated, and this will help to stop chafting. 'Leakage' is best mopped up with a carefully placed sanitary towel (wings are not needed as you will place it to the back and not the front- and use the cheap ones without the fancy covering- this only makes the area more sweaty and you need the padding for support) and to save embarassing the house dispose of in sented nappy sacs! sittimng is comfy but being still increases a sluggish digestive sysytem- so walks (I have found stairs the least painful of activities) will shift the gut- but you will need extra protection- as acvtivity increases movement of the gut which will increase leakage (think about it!) To keep everything 'soft' I have taken to eating baked apples with rasins and brown sugar, oranges are too acidic, and musli is too far the other way! If you must have a curry then go for something dry! Dont forget the red meat to keep up the iron levels! A towel under the sheet- and if can manage to be alone- then leave the area open to the fresh air (with a i of tissue to catch the drips) take what ever pain relief you are offered...relgiously and if all else fails have a good cry and swear at the invisable man! Take a cushion to work (not a ring- you dont need the downward pressure) and remember to sit on it! As an older friend told me 'years ago you used to convalesce for 3 weeks after this- now you are expected to go home and get on with life and as no one talks about it no one understands what its like'BUT...I can't wait to be pain and leak free- to be able to go to the loo in 5 minutes instead of it taking an hour!"

For many months local GP's telling me nothing was wrong and to leave it alone. It was only after kicking up a huge fuss did they finally refer me to a surgeon who confirmed I had 3 malteaser sized hems in my rectum. They were treated by banding twice in the course of 4 months to no avail, and eventually I was offered HALO in April this year.The HALO helped stop bleeding and reduced swelling/pain, but not enough that it no longer affects my life. And the itching - OH MY GOD THE ITCHING!! Also since the procedure I have been experiencing pinching of the nerves which cause sharp stabbing pains. About 90% of the symptoms are coming from the larger of the 3 hems on one side.I had a follow up with the surgeon last month to discuss surgical removal as the constant itching and pain are still unbearable, but he has refused ANY further treatment on the grounds that it's too soon after my last op and also that it may cause further nerve damage. While I trust that he is giving me his best advice, I cannot comtinue to live like this and was thinking about booking further treament privately. I'm afraid to have a hemorrhoidectomy especially after what he's said, but I was considering going back to less invasive treatments such as banding or sclerotherapy now that the hemorrhoids are smaller.I would be very grateful for any advice or personal experience you guys could pass on to me as I don't know what to do, I just know I can't ""learn to live with it"" as the doctors keep telling me.Cheers!"
"Piles","My 10 years with Haemorroids ends successfully with Haemorrhoidectomy","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-10-years-with-haemorroids-ends-successfully-with-haemorrhoidectomy-36362","I first had an issue with haemorrhoids 16 years ago (when I was 23). I spent a day off work with a bad stomach ache, and straining on the toilet a few times during that day. Later that night I felt a lump, which I now know to be a perianal haematoma which isn’t a haemorrhoid, but it is very very painful and causes haemorrhoids. It is basically a blood clot which the body can break down over two weeks. Pain killers and ointments etc don’t help, the only thing that did is a warm bath. After two weeks it was gone.Fast forward 5 years to 2001, and after a heavy night on the drink I got up in the morning and fell down the stairs, I landed square flat on my back side, which hurt, but thought nothing of it. Later that day I felt a very painful lump, it was a perianal haematoma again, excruciating painful, it changes your mood and nothing at all helps but a bath, creams are useless. But again, because all it is, is a blood clot, the body breaks it down and it’s gone after 2 weeks. After two weeks and 2 days after the perianal haematoma occurred (basically 2 days after the perianal haematoma had cleared up) I felt a pain coming on, getting stronger and stronger, but no lump or anything else I could feel or see. This was the start of internal haemorrhoids.It was very very painful and again all the creams and ointments simply don’t do anything, the only temporary relief was a bath. It hurt all the time, whether I was sitting or standing, I tried carrying on but people must have thought I was miserable, and people simple do not understand, it’s not like you have broken arm that people can see, and you don’t want to tell people what is wrong, and those you do tell, still can’t comprehend the pain.I gave it a chance to clear up, but it didn’t, so I went to the doctor after a month. The GP at the time referred me. I got an appointment for 2 months later at an NHS hospital (so that’s 3 months in terrible pain, having to carry on at work!) During this time I remembered I actually had private healthcare! So contacted them to hopefully get something sorted a bit quicker. The NHS hospital banded me 3 times, it was a bit of a factory line, and a bit off putting by a female student being shown the ropes. It was a painful procedure, and as I left I nearly fainted in the car park walking back to my car. I made it, made it home and was very pleased this should be the beginning of the end. I had a follow up appointment just over a month later.After 2 weeks I was still uncomfortable (but better), so kept my appointment with the private hospital. The consultant there couldn’t really help, he recommended a muscle relaxant.I went back to the NHS hospital for the follow up appointment and said that I could still feel pain. The same consultant was dismissive, questioned my sexuality and said couldn’t I just ignore the pain. My opinion of him wasn’t a good one, and I didn’t want t go back there!The relaxant from the private consultant didn’t help. I continued putting up with the discomfort (i’d no longer describe it as pain since the banding) and it eventually went away, by September it was gone completely, brilliant!A year later I went back to the private hospital because some discomfort had returned. I work with computers so sit down for most of the day, and I was suffering with severe pins-and-needles down the backs of my legs which made sitting very uncomfortable.He referred me to another consultant and in April 2004 that consultant gave me an injection, which seemed to solve the problem for 4 years.4 years later I got a perianal haematoma due to a bike ride, I got it checked at the private hospital again and it cleared up by itself in 2 weeks.A year later another bike ride brought on some pain, and I continued to manage this with off-the-shelf treatments. I was now getting a lump after a bowel movement, this lump would disappear almost immediately however.I went back to private hospital about the pain and was referred for a endoscopy within the NHS (because I no longer had private healthcare) in Jan 2010. That came back OK, and was banded then also. Things were fine for 6 months.Pain came back mid 2010 so I decided to go to my new GP (new doctors since moving house) and money was getting tight for the private consultations.The GP would not refer me, and prescribed Protosedyl. This didn’t seem to work and I started investigating privately funded options like Halo.I kept going back to my GP saying I was trying Protosedyl without much success, I did think it helped but it certainly isn’t a cure.My GP referred me to hospital for a consultation. The consultant examined me and said it was a small pile mass and not much could be done. That was not good news, but he did want to check for an abscess, so that was good news in terms of progress. I was referred for an ultrasound and went for that in Oct 2010. It was not pleasant at all.I was then referred for an MRI. A bit worried by that, and went for that in Jan 2011, again all on the NHS which has always been utterly brilliant since the first 3 bandings I had.All results came back OK and I saw the consultant who then did some banding in Jun 2011. 24 hours later I felt really bad, faint, very cold, shivering, sickness, and slept as soon as I got home, it was like I had some bad reaction to the banding.The pain had been relieved though, for only a month, so went back to the consultant who did some more banding on 24 Oct 2011. Again the pain cleared up and pain came back just after a month after a bowel movement.I decided to go back to the private consultant and to ask his opinon in Dec 2011 and he just said enough is enough and it is time to be referred for an operation with the NHS. I got an appointment for February but could not take it. Got another for April and I went for that.I went into hospital in the morning at 8am. Had an enema at 9:30am which cleared me out good and proper. 11am they came to get me for surgery, 11:50 I woke up, felt brilliant. Then rested.Other blokes on the ward had trouble doing a wee, one wet the bed because he couldn’t feel anything. Luckily I was fine, did a wee so that meant I could go home.I got home at 7pm, and slept slept slept. Got out of bed at about 10am the next morning, felt very uncomfortable but I wouldn’t call in painful, afterall the haemorrhoids were painful!I went out shopping, walking slowly. There was blood, but had a pad to absorb that.I went back to work the day after, I was getting on fine.The next day I needed a poo in the morning, and nearly fainted, the pain was unbelievable, and had to take the day off work.I went to my doctor and he gave me some Lactulose to loosen things up a bit. Going to the toilet became OK after 2 weeks, but successive bowel movements were never as bad as the first.It is now almost 2 two after my operation, and I still haven’t fully healed. I forget about it sometime which is brilliant, a true test that the pain of piles has been eradicated for me. Some bowel movements can hurt sometime, and produce some blood, but it soon stops.There has been a lump, which used to ooze puss, but that has stopped, and the lump seems to be getting smaller, very slowly over time.The operation by the way, was a very simple removal of one haemorrhoid, they didn’t staple, just because it was one, they simply cut it out, good bloody riddance!So after over 10 years, and creams, bandings, injections, the proper haemorrhoidectomy seems to have solved the problem, but the reluctance of doctors and consultants to refer me for the operation is a surprising one. I have heard it maybe because the cure can be as bad as the symptoms. If someone has been struck by this horrible condition in its worst form, they wouldn’t say that!"

This is when they 'bulge' out and look like cushions around the anal opening.Over the course of ten years, they have flared up maybe three times. This is the only time they have been painful in any way.I am considering having them banded so that they fall off, in the hope that my anal opening won't look so ugly... I was wondering what everyone's opinion on this is?I have read some real horror stories about banding on the internet, but it would appear that in almost all of these cases the patients were already in pain with their haemorrhoids.

The hemorrhoids were big enough to stretch the skin quite a lot (I had them for over six months) and every time I have a BM now it still looks and feels like I have them. They're not really skin tags, just soft bulges. I have itching and burning still, usually after a BM and lasting sometimes all day. I sitz bath, eat a very high fibre diet and drink plenty of water.Did anyone suffer from these 'bulges' after their THD / hemorrhoid surgery? And if so, did the skin ever go back to normal and the symptoms disappear?While I'm not in as much discomfort as I was pre-surgery, I'm still upset that I'm not yet 100%, despite the surgery, and am hoping that this is just a temporary problem as a result of having large hemorrhoids, and that it will go away!Thanks for any and all feedback, it's much appreciated!"

I was wrong, and I turned to the interent to read others experiences whih helped me through! For that reason I feel like I owe it to future patients to share my story.I am 42, female, no kids...First sign of Haemorrhoids about 5 years ago - Probably because of my profession - I am an equestrain, spending up to 6 hours a day in the saddle - plus I smoked, drank, ate poorly. I foolishly assumed that becasue I was super active, and not overweight, that these things could never affect me!Mine were internal, and never bothered me in terms of pain or bleeding, however they very occasionally prolapsed which was horrendous! I grew to be constantly constipated, using laxatives every day, which I knew could not be healthy.2 years ago I eventually went to the doctor and was referrred to a surgeon, and I had the HALO surgery.Afterwards was great - I thought I was cured, although the surgeon did warn me that they were much bigger than he had thought they would be.After a year the HALO had failed, and they came back - to be fair I had thought I was 'cured' and did not change my lifestyle much. What an idiot!So in Jan I was again referred 'urgently'. Jeez the change in the NHS in just 2 years! It took a good 6 weeks to see the surgeon and another 3 months to get a date for surgery.Surgery went fine - surgeon wasn't great though - they were trying to discharge me when I went for a pee, and burst into tears when there was bloody 'stuff' hanging out my back passage! Turns out it was packing, and normal, but you would have thought they would have mentioned it! I was still pretty drugged up!That night the local wore off, and the pain started...A dull constant ache that was far worse than a sharp pain..Trust me, in the first week, you will probably think that you are the one in a hundred that surgery has gone wrong for. You aren't. It feels like that for all of us. In the first weeks it often felt like I had a double sword stuck in there.... not nice.In the first weeks HOT baths are your friend! I found that the hotter, the better! And as often as you need! I didn't care, if I needes it at 4am, I'm doing it!After 7 days I STILL had not had a BM... I was in agony, and had even stopped being able to pee, except in the bath or shower. I was convinced I was broken. I could not relax a single pelvic muscleI went to my GP who gave me a muscle relaxant, as well as some Tramadol, plus more stool softeners.As others have said - get off the codeine as soon as you can - that was what was keep me from bms...Take lots of stool softeners and fibre supplements.And you really have to change your diet.High fibre, fruit, veg - NO alcohol, caffeine, meat, dairy, white potatos, pasta or rice. Trust me it's worth it!As others have also said, and it may sound disgusting, but the pain was such that I found it impossible to relax enough to go in the toilet....I had by first bm after 8 days, in the bath...Then, horrendously, I coudn't go again for another week! I thought I was dying! Just a tiny amount in the bath, and having to wear a pad for horrible discharge.My life revolved around what I ate, and trying to have a bm. It was awful, and it becomes really hard to see a way out of it all.The pain came and went, but it was to constant throbbing and the constipation that was the worst...I was taking Docusate Sodium and Lactulose DAILY, plus lots of fruit and veg and soups, and then finally, just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, at day 20 post surgery, I had 3 bms!Squatting is your friend also!! For that week I would squat over a bucket in the bath, being able to soothe the pain in a hot bath immediately afterwards..It's scary, becasue it's hard to imagine that you can ever go normally again...But slowly it got easier and easier..That day was the day when I improved 50%, and that has continued week by week....When you go to the toilet, leaning forward and having most of your weight on your feet than on the seat helps SO much!By week 5 I probably felt 85% back to normal....BUT... then I attempted to wean myself off the laxatives and also to introduce more 'usual' food into my diet, including alcohol..... This was a MISTAKE!BMs, although still regulalr, became extremely painful and hard to pass...So I have gone back on the stool softeners and cut again the alcohol, meat and 'crap' like sweets and crisps!It truly does need a change of lifestyle to facilitate a recovery!Today I feel 90% back to normal..Having gone through it all it is definitely worth it! Mine would only have got worse with my job and age, and never having the urge to go, and taking strong laxatives daily is no way to live.Although I am still taking stool softeners, having a regular urge every day feels so great!This is a couple of months of pain, then discomfort, for what is pretty much a permanent solution to a condition that can affect you for life!You can get though it!Please feel free if you have any questions that I could answer!Good luck with your own recoveries x "

Following a digital examination the GP confirmed that the usual solutions would not suffice and a referral to a Consultant was needed - fortunately I have private medical insurance and my appointment came through quickly.At my first appointment the Consultant completed a digital examination for himself and deduced that my rhoids were “quite large”. At this stage he suggested a Sigmoidoscopy (lower bowel camera) and ligation (banding) to see if that would help - whilst I was told the procedure is uncomfortable and not painful I opted for sedation on the basis that why would anyone choose to be in any discomfort when they really don’t need to be!?![/color][color=#333333]Having researched the procedure online I returned to the hospital some 3 weeks later. I have to say the enema was a surprise in more ways than one – I now understand it’s a necessary requirement, but given the reason it’s being administered is it unreasonable to assume they would be a little more gentle? #Wowzers! Anyway, I waited around all morning and I was eventually taken to the Operating Room (OR). At this point I have to say Sedation is wonderful - I remember nothing between the fluid being injected in the cannula and subsequently being in the recovery room. Given I had been tinkered with all I can remember at this point is feeling as though I needed to go to the toilet. I was subsequently transferred back to my room where I remained for a couple of hours in a little discomfort, but I recall being in pain – the Consultant came to say he would see me at my follow-up appointment and I was eventually released by a nurse that said “it looks like you’re coming back to see us” and I spotted THD on her paperwork.[/color][color=#333333]It was about 2-3 weeks when I had a follow-up with my Consultant, which gave me lots of time to read up on what THD was etc. – compared to the rhoidectomy of yesteryear it sounded like an absolute gem of a procedure. The Consultant asked how I had got on with the ligation and I explained there had been no real change however, he said he didn’t think it would work given the size of the rhoids – so we discussed returning for a THD in 2 weeks’ time. So, there is the background…[/color][u][color=#333333]Day One[/color][/u][color=#333333]I returned to the hospital for my THD last Friday and, given the procedural information I had read on line, I was feeling quite good about it. Having had another fairly uncomfortable enema (by the hands of the person that delivered the previous one! #Ouch) I was told that I was 2nd on the list and would be seen quite quickly – it was roughly mid-morning when I walked to the OR. At this point I was given the cannula etc. before the GA was administered. Quick question: Is it just me that likes that buzzy lightheaded feeling you get with a GA? I’ve had a few in my time and I really enjoy it![/color][color=#333333]The next thing I remember is waking up in the Recovery Room with an overwhelming feeling that I needed a bowel movement (BM) – I’m talking that real desperate need somebody has when they have a stomach upset. I recall one nurse saying it’s probably the packing and the other said the consultant did not use any – I was then told somebody was on their way to transfer me to my room but I could have a bed pan if I needed it. I was quickly returned to my room and I asked if I was able to go to the toilet – I was told I could, but needless to say I actually couldn’t do either of the things one usually does when they visit the lavatory![/color][color=#333333]After a good hour or so I asked if any pain relief was available as I was really quite uncomfortable. I was subsequently given codeine, which did help – mainly because I fell asleep if I’m honest! I was woken by a nurse wanting to take my obs – I said I needed the loo first and the nurse agreed to return within several minutes. I managed to urinate however, upon returning to the room the nurse had quite a fright as found me lying on the bed looking as white as the pillow case, feeling dizzy and sweating – I was given Oxygen for a while. I was given more codeine later on and, after more sleep, I eventually saw the Consultant who said that he would see me again in a couple of weeks, but with regard to that day I could stay overnight or go home. Being tired as I was unable to get any decent sleep, I opted to go home at around 18:30. Upon check out I was prescribed Fybogel (to be taken Twice Daily) and Paracetamol (as and when) – due to other ailments I have access to Cocodamol 30/500 and Tramadol hence I was good to go. The journey home was not too bad however, the left side of my rectum was particularly sore hence I sat with all my weight on the right bottom cheek for the duration. When at home I pretty much spent the evening sleeping, thinking about the toilet or trying to go to the toilet! [/color][u][color=#333333]Day Two[/color][/u][color=#333333]I woke up several times in the night with the feeling that I needed to go to the toilet, so I eventually got up to watch TV at around 04:30. Feeling the need to go to toilet lasted all day – other than briefly after passing wind or a short while longer after taking a Tramadol. I eventually went for a very small BM however, it was quite painful to be honest and I wondered if my body was telling me I needed to but my head was telling me not to – I was literally having spasms, such a weird feeling that happened several times throughout the day. The good news was that whilst I still felt rough, I was more mobile and thought THD may just be the best thing since sliced bread. [/color][u][color=#333333]Day Three[/color][/u][color=#333333]Pretty much mirrors Day two having woken up at 04:00. I went downstairs and eventually managed to go to the toilet for a small BM however, it was soooo painful I felt exhausted afterward. I returned to bed mid-morning for a couple of hours and then remained in the confines of my house for the rest of the day. [/color][u][color=#333333]Day Four[/color][/u][color=#333333]Woke up at a reasonable time and managed to potter around the house all day. Took a 40 minute drive to take my child to school and back and noticed that the desperate urge to go to the toilet has been replaced with a fullness/weight feeling and there is now an aching on the left side of my rectum. I managed to do the smallest of BM’s, which, in the main, was probably my body dispelling some of the Fybogel! In cleaning myself I noticed a small lump on my rectum, which I can only liken to an external rhoid – brilliant, just brilliant! By the afternoon I actually felt like I was in pain until I read about and decided to take a sitz bath – temporarily relieving the pain, until I took more Tramadol![/color][u][color=#333333]Day Five[/color][/u][color=#333333]Today. I’m feeling somewhat down about my post THD experience. It doesn’t seem to be consistent with the majority of literature that says you’ll be running marathons within 48 hours (slight exaggeration, but you know what I mean)! I’ve got what I think is an external rhoid, the left side of my rectum is uncomfortable, and when I sit down or stand up I can feel pressure - like you do when the rhoids are playing up…not to mention that after I drove my child to school today I felt like I’d received a swift kick up the arse when I got back to the house. I had a BM this afternoon and it was painful…AGAIN…I ended up elevating my feet on a footstool to making the passing of the BM more comfortable![/color][color=#333333]Having got all that of my chest, I’m hoping somebody can offer an opinion on the following…[/color][color=#333333]Could the lump on my rectum be linked to the procedure and shrink over time? I’m wondering if I’ve not noticed before as I previously had a prolapse?[/color][color=#333333]Could the lump be a new rhoid or hematoma given the constant feeling of requiring the loo and then my associated attempts to go? [/color][color=#333333]Given I’m now at Day 5, should I really have an aching feeling where I think the procedure was completed?[/color][color=#333333]Given I’m still uncomfortable, would you contact the GP or carry on taking the tramadol for now? [/color][color=#333333]I’m off work at the moment, but I will need a sick note in 2 days – is it likely that I’ll be ready to go back at this point?Many thanks for reading and, where you can, replying with your comment(s).[/color] "

"Piles","Hemorrhoidectomy with NO pain","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hemorrhoidectomy-with-no-pain-492168","I wanted to write this post because before I had this surgery I could find very few positive experiences online. In fact, most people seemed to have absolute horror stories of horrific and long lasting pain. I was seriously considering cancelling my surgery because of what I was reading.I feel that I have a very high pain threshold having had 3 children with no pain relief, and another surgical procedure last year that I recovered from in minimal pain. But I was very scared by all the things I was reading and it seemed that a good 90%+ of people were in hideous pain after their hemorrhoid surgery.So I had mine done on Monday (its Wednesday now) and I went in to have one external one removed that was affecting my relationship with my husband as it made me very self conscious during sex. I also had an internal one but I wasn't having any real symptoms so I wasn't too concerned about having that removed. But if I was having surgery anyway it was probably best to remove it before it became worse. I had banding about 6 weeks ago but it didn't work. During the surgery the doctor found another internal one which he removed and in recovery he told me that I would be in some pain from the procedure. I had discussed my fears with him just before surgery and he told me to expect pain for at least a week, if not two. I found this pretty depressing to be honest but I decided to brave it.So I came round in recovery in absolutely no pain, which is what I expected really seeing as I was dosed up to the eyeballs on the pain relief from surgery still. The nurses kept asking if I had any pain which I found strange. I was given the meds about 2.45pm, woke up about 4pm and left the hospital at 7pm. I got home and I still felt fine, to the extent that I was standing in the kitchen holding my 3 year old and drinking a cup of tea until my husband told me off and made me sit down. I went to bed about 9pm and took two co-codamol and a diclofenac as prescribed but I still wasn't in any pain. I only took it so I didn't wake up in the night in agony.I woke up a few times through the early hours and kept having a little check to see if the pain had started but still nothing. I got up at 8am and felt fine. I took another diclofenac as its anti imflammatory and that seemed like a good idea but I didn't take any painkillers all day. I was taking my twice daily laxative as prescribed but didn't manage a bowel movement all day. I did however manage to pass the sponge thing they placed up there during surgery.I felt a bit achey before bed so I took another diclofenac and two paracetamol and slept through again.So its mid morning Wednesday now and I managed two small BMs at about 7am and 8am today. It was a little bit sore but only how it feels when you've had a bout of bad tummy and made yourself sore from over wiping. I would describe it as slightly stingy but not pain. I have not experienced anything I could honestly call pain. I am a bit achey today so I've taken the same meds as last night but I've only done that because I'm going back to college this afternoon. I'm surprised that I was told to take two weeks off as I really only feel like I've fallen over and landed on my bottom and bruised it and that isn't something I'd miss college for!I realise that a lot of people have had genuine pain from this procedure and I really sympathise with them but I just wanted to reassure people that if you feel you have a high pain threshold then you stand a good chance of being ok after having this done. From the things I read before my surgery I felt I was doomed to be in terrible pain for a long while. Even my surgeon said its not uncommon to still be in pain at 2 months which is a horrific thought.I might post this on a few other sites so apologies if you read this more than once!"

But first a brief back story (excuse the pun!):I live in South Korea and around 3 months ago i had really bad stomach pains, vomitting blood, feeling like death etc. Now, being in a foreign country were English isnt spoken too much i was very scared and went to AE staright away and pretty much got a whole menagerie of tests including a colon and endoscopy. The doctors had a good look around and found nothing wrong. The vomitting stopped almost as quickly as it began and my stomach pain vanished. However, a few weeks later i started passing stool that was very painful and then started seeing a lot of blood. It was everywhere; in my stool, when i wiped and even (and most alarmingly) dripping straight from my anus. This was a very distressing time for me, I couldnt even get intelligible feedback from the doctors (no ones fault i should add!). Anyway, after another round of 'scopys they found I had a Hiatal Hernia! - My first question is has anyone else here been diagnosed with a Hiatal Hernia??So this explained the stomach pain and through my own research/assumption/vague doctor explanation this most probably caused constipation, stress, straining and eventaully resulted in blood flowing freely from my back side. The doctors previously couldnt see hemorrhoids or anal fissures. But after one particulary bloody episode I returned to AE and they said, without tests being carried out, i had either internal hemorrhoids or an acute anal fissure.So my questions are;-How do you know the difference?-Without another (expensive) colonoscopy will I be able to tell?-Do Hemorrhoids exagerate into (or casue) anal fissures? -Are the treatments for each condition different?-Is this a lifetime issue now I've got it?I know what you're thinking; why dont i ask a doctor. Well its not that easy (or cheap) and i figured someone here probably had the same questions and got decent answers (in english) they might want to share?Also, happy(ish) ending; I rarely see blood anymore, except after a particulary hard stool, and only then its when i wipe and no dripping. I put this down to a few things.I started eating a LOT more fiber, i was trying to maintain 35g of the stuff a day which equated to 1 banana, 2 large apples (200g) and 300g of sweet potato (skin on). 3 - 4 litres of water a day too. At the height of my pain i would have a spoonful of olive oil first thing in the morning, followed by a sitz bath and the MAIN thing is squatting while passing, i cannot recommend this last point enough!Im actually experiencing a bit of pain at the moment but im putting this down to having a couple of weeks off my regime. Alcohol and fried/salty food should be avoided for prolonged periods it seems! Also for those of you that work out, avoid lower back exercises, or at least go light on the weights in that area. PS. This forum has really helped me, I have only just discovered it! Also, I want to avoid taking medication at all costs. I will try coconut oil in my sitz bath too, thanks for the heads up!

"Piles","Haemorrhoids or something else? ","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/haemorrhoids-or-something-else--488832","This is long so I appreciate your reading! Back at the end of June I went to the toilet after a night of drinking and passed a lot of blood. It happened for 5 more bowel movements and then stopped other than spotting.A few weeks later and the beginning of July, I went to the toilet and realised I had worms. It was unmistakeable as there were moving worms on the toilet paper and in the bowl! All night I could feel them crawling inside me and in my vagina which was so distressing. I changed my bed, washed everything as you should and took Ovex. The next few weeks were so hard, I was sure they were moving around my body which I now realise wasn't the case but was me being stressed and worrying. That night was the first and last time I saw moving worms.I went to my GP regarding the blood and was sent for a sigmoidoscopy. Nothing was found except 2 internal hemmeroids.I still have strange sensations around the opening of my anus. It isn't like the crawling I had before though. It's almost like a tickle at all times of the day. I wouldn't say it itches, but I am aware of a feeling there. I have taken enough ovex to keep the company in business but the feelings remain. Every time I feel anything, I go to the toilet and crouch over a mirror to check for worms and I can't ever see anything. Occasionally, I will have a small amount of faecal matter left over in the anus which I have read is normal if you have hemmeroids and also some mucous. Now, can I stop my 6 months of stressing and trust the worms have gone and that what I am feeling is from the hemmeroids and possibly my mind being too in tune with every little feeling down there because I am so worried? Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. I feel like I'm losing my mind worrying!"

I had been offered the operation 10 years ago but knew from close family experience that it was a painful op. I then came across the new HALO technique at Glan clwyd hospital wales which promised fast recovery and very little pain. How wrong ! I went into theatre after having the eminia clear my bowels out. Came out of theatre and was in recovery ward from 10.30 till 2pm. I woke with immediate pain in my anus. Like a spasm pain. They tried all painkillers just help me rest. The surgeon recommended morphine as he explained the piles were very large so to expect pain. Eventually they put me on a self administer morphine machine. This help relieve the spasm pain. I was then sent to the ward 6 for overnight stay due to the morphine and the previous medication. On the ward I asked for my bag which was still on the day unit ward. 5 times I asked for my bag. I had no underwear on, blood all over my hospital gown and a pad that obviously was going to fall off once I got out of bed. I wasn't offered a jug of water or food despite asking for them. Bearing in mind I hadn't eaten since night before and it was now starving. After going up to the nurses desk I asked for something to eat. Eventually they gave me a packet of crackers and a slice of cheese. I also asked for a clean gown so I could walk down to the day unit to get my own bag. The nurse shouted across to health care assistant to go for it. Why this couldn't have happened sooner I don't know. By this time I was so upset with the lack of dignity they gave me and the combination of drugs I was in tears. I eventually was given my bag at 5.30pm! I had packed it with food, water, sanatory towels, clean pjs and underwear. All the items I needed but was denied. By this time I just wanted to go home. They removed the morphine and let me go. Said there is no doctor to sign the discharge papers but these will be faxed to my gp in morning. I asked about the dressing/packing still inside me. The health care assassistant said district nurse will visit me. Fortunately i had some tremodol from my last bout of piles to see me through a night. Next morning I went to gp no discharge papers no leaflet on aftercare nothing.gp rang the ward to no avail and said she would follow it up. Gp gave me tremadol and lactose and recommended paracetamol and ibrofine in between tremolo dosage . Once in my system they helped a lot. Day 2 I had a small poo where the foam dressing came out along with blood. Day 3 and pain is bad like a bad bout of painful piles especially when using the toilet. Its difficult to know if i need a poo or sensation is due to swollon piles. I believe it does get worse before it gets better so hoping it will settle down in a week or two. Gp gave me 2 weeks off work which I think I will need as currently having baths and painkillers during the night. I read that the Halo operation was a quick recovery and less pain but in my experience I wasn't expecting this much pain. I did have to have some external piles removed and stitched so maybe that causes the pain rather than the halo. Gp still hasn't recieved the discharge info! I have written this as I gained a lot of info from other people's experience but I would recommend that you keep someone with you if going to the ward as otherwise safer at home. I couldn't fault the nursing staff in theatre or the surgeon. Excellent care until put on ward 6!"

I was pregnant 4 years ago and acquired a rectal tear. I developed a skin tag. 3 months ago I noticed the area around the tag was painful hard and swollen and seem to be discharging a foul smelling clearing red liquid.I was refered to a GI facility. I explained what the issue was as the dr looked at the area and told me it was a hemorrhoid, and since I mentioned blood on the tissue paper she scheduled a colonoscopy. I believed the blood was from the tear but she wanted to make sure. After the the colonoscopy the tag (or hemorrhoid) became double in size. If was hot to the touch and after a month of constant secretion of rust colored thick fluid I began not believing this was in fact hemorrhoid. I finally pushed on it while looking in a mirror and saw the rust colored fluid exiting from my anus. I separated my skin and pushed again to see it coming out of the tear I mentioned earlier. I felt immense relief until the next morning. It was bigger than ever. I walked my kids to the carnival in town and home again. Looked in the mirror and there was a white line down the center and very hot and sensitive . They begged me to take them back later when dad got off work so I decided to deal with it. The kids and I went down the superslide. The last bump ruptured it. I had to walk them home right away and my undies were soiled with puss and blood. I went back to the same GI today after 3 hours of painful sleep and constant discharge. I was again told it was a hemorrhoid and that I needed surgery to remove it. Im worried that this is something more than a hemorrhoid. The dr didn't do a digital exam ever. Didn't test the fluid coming out of me. I fell like she sent me for a needless colonoscopy and now for a surgery that's not fitting the problem. does this sound like a hemorrhoid or an abscess? What can I say to make my dr hear me? If she had seen it on Saturday maybe it would be different. All I got today was her commenting on how she's glad it's draining and if I don't have a fever it's not an issue. Do I really have to wait for it to enter my bloodstream before It gets attention. Help! Advice andunderstanding is needed. "

And forget any ideas about going to the loo.I now have some idea of what child birth must be like after I finally managed the 'two the loo' for the first time after five days, horrendous. Thank god I'm not a woman.Never again, hopefully.I would also add, according to my surgeon, it can take up to three months before everything is back to normal. Although you will feel allot better after the first two to three weeks.I don't know how the information sheet (link below) can say that you can usually return to work around a week later after this particular procedure. As far as I was concerned, not a chance. I'm now nine weeks in and feeling OK. Internally healing is still going on, and am still having the odd day with regular visits to the loo. But I am told this will settle down.Some tips that will help with recovery. Apart from pain killers and drinking plenty of fluids I found warm baths help give relief (albeit for a short while) from the pain, discomfort and that constant feeling that you want to have your bowels open. I was sometimes having up to three baths a day for the first two weeks just to give me some relief. And if you are prescribed Co-codamol pain relief, come off them as soon as you can or you will suffer with constipation, and that isn't good I can assure you.

I have endometriosis and have suffered from pain in the behind for 3 years. He did an MRI on my pelvis, which wasn't where the pain was and told me fibroids were causing bad period pain- this wasn't where the pain was! He'd already done a rigid colonscopy exam in his consultation room and said it looked fine. Ideally I'd have liked an MRI of the bowel as I do think the endo has spread to that area. All the symptoms add up.After telling him that the pain was still there, he told me he'll look for hemarhoids. I hate anal exams but went ahead. As he was poking about I heard and felt lots of snaps and him asking the nurse for more. The pain was pretty bad but bearable.I was also bleeding a lot. He wiped all this off and left the room, said, ""see you in 3 months"" before I'd even got dressed. I left in a hurry, embarrassed and aware I was wearing a white dress, with a lot of bloood trailing down my legs.The nurse found me in the car park and told me she needed to chat, that I'd just had hemrhoid banding done on multiple hemarhoids and I can expect to feel discomfort etc. I just walked away, I had tears streaming down my face and felt awful.Driving back to work was difficult as the pain began to increase. I wasn't expecting to have to take anytime off. I'm my own boss so can't call in sick.It continued for 48 hours, I was sick, the pain meant I couldn't sleep.

He told me that I would not be able to do anything for at least 2 weeks, and to live off laxatives.I am wondering if I would be better having the haemorrhoid's banded, as that was an option.I just thought surgery might be the best option as it would get rid of them for once and all!I am in no pain, or discomfort, but they do bleed, and I did have the same problem 7 years ago (when I decided to leave well alone!) The thought of surgery absolutely terrifies me, but I am more concerned about what happens when I get home!Help!Mary"
"Piles","Bleeding on and off from rectum","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/bleeding-on-and-off-from-rectum-61614","My partner who is 28 has sudden bleeding whilst passing stools which aren't hard, quite a lot of bright red blood, and then it goes back to normal again. He doesn't have any pain but just doesn't feel quite right. He has been to the doctor and been examined but they cant feel piles, so he is having a camera up there in a weeks time, he is obviously quite panicky about it, any ideas what it could be?"
"Piles","Pile relief what can i do next?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/pile-relief-what-can-i-do-next--40909","I have had piles since I was 26, (45 now) my then GP said I may require surgery if the internal piles did not improve. I was having real difficulty sitting down after a bowel movement, really painful. But a change in diet more fibre really helped and more exercise, however I was not overweight. I have managed them for many years, and for the majority of the time they never bothered me. This year, Feb, I noticed a lump on my anus, my internal piles had also erupted again quite bad. I was having quite a stressful time at work and home and had lost nearly 2 stone in weight over 6 months, my diet was shot, no sleep, little food, not good. I visited my new GP and had an internal examination, he said my piles were back, and the lump which was oozing puss was an external pile, not a thrombosed one. He prescribed anusol which worked well on my external pile, reduced the pain .It still kept swelling up, but would reduce back down. I was off work due to my GP advice due to stress and heart palpitations, anxiety attacks etc. My internal piles improved, and stopped using the anusol as the external pile had shrunk down, it hadn't gone away though. Come mid July, I had food poisoning, and as a result was planted on the loo on and off for 24 hours, this made my piles really painful, and the external one grew really quickly again. I went and saw another GP at my practice again, and he prescribed another type of cream. I used this for a few days, but it gave me real bad headaches, he said it might. The pain and piles in and out did not improve, even with a change of diet again. So a couple of weeks ago, I went and seen my GP again, and had another internal examination, he could not see anything to be concerned over, and prescribed yet another cream, which was directly for pain relief as the external pile is directly on my anal sphincter, so painful on a bowel movement, and after. This cream has also not worked, I asked about surgery, and he said the piles are not bad enough for surgery, wow, how bad can they get then..a friend of mine has just had surgery on his piles, and is now permanently incontinent from his back passage. I cannot continue like this, it affects my own self being, it is getting very depressing. Hot baths and direct showers on my external pile which is still a lump and oozing puss (serum the GP said) does help temporarily. My GP said the pile will disappear eventually, but I can't see that happening, it is so painful. What can I do??"

"Piles","Hemorrhoids and Depression","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hemorrhoids-and-depression-26957","Im on this forum now because i'm at the point of looking for anti depresants to help me with this awfull condition.I had piles during my 1st pregnancy and at the birth of my first child but they went within a week so when I got them again after the delivery of my second baby I wasnt concerned, however to cut a long story short 16 months later I have had internal, prolapsed and external piles. I've had them thrombose internally and externally and developed fissures and a Polyp. I've seen 4 different surgens both privately and NHS and have had an Anal streatch, banding, Stapled Hemorrhoidectomy (PPH) botox injection for a fissure, a polypectomy and just last week dopler guided litication (Halo) and skin tag removal but here I am laying in bed unable to work, look after my kids, walk or do anything. Everyone is really putting themselves out for me and my friends and family have been great but they cant go on taking time off and asking about me forever.I still have this feeling of unbeleivable fullness, burning, stinging and after the last operation it looks like I have a new inflamed external hemorrhoid. Its gone way past embaresement for me. I need to get better because I can not live like this much longer.I eat really well and take lactulose to keep my stools soft but i'm unable to exersise. Im so depressed and just want to feel normal again. Go for a walk, take the kids to the park, go on holiday, find a job I cant belive all the things this horrible condition is making me miss. I feel like ive missed my baby growing up. I know how lovely it is to be a mum because I enjoyed every minuet with my first baby but now i'm a different person in an awfull place. Any words of advice or wisdom would be great. Anyone who has got through this or is currentlly going through it and wants to talk."
