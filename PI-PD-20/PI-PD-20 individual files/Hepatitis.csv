"could I have Alcoholic Hepatitis?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/could-i-have-alcoholic-hepatitis--708185","Hello! So I've been going to the doctor because my liver enzymes have been elevated. My doctor has been doing a lot of tests to see what is the problem, but I was just curious if it could be Alcoholic Hepatitis. When I was in college, for about a year, I partied every now and then (I would say like once or twice a month) but when I did, I would abuse the drinking.One time (about six years ago) I ended up in the hospital. The doctors said that I had ""shock liver"" due to the alcohol, and they said I could drink but never in that amount again. So, since then, I continued having a glass or two once in a while.I've been reading online about the possible causes, and I read that not every person with Alcoholic Hepatitis drinks heavily for a large period of time and also that sometimes it could be genetic. My maternal grandfather died of Cirrhosis due to alcoholism.I had told the doctors that I drank alcohol occasionally, and they know I had shock liver (since she was the one who treated me afterwards) but I'm now thinking she could not remember the cause.Now they are doing a lot of tests because they are leaning to Autoinmune Hepatitis.I would like to know if this could be my case. I see my doctor in three weeks, but I am already impatient. Btw, I haven't had any alcohol for months, but my liver enzymes are still elevated the same."

Especially geno type 1.?I had lived with being hep c positive for approximately twenty years. I begun a twelve week course of new medication eight weeks ago. The virus load was (1,200,000) at the beginning of the course. On the fourth week the virus load had been reduced to an amazing (28). On the sixth week blood test the virus is now not detected. My liver function test is normal though my liver has a slightly above average fat content, this too can be reduced through diet and exercise. I still have four weeks of treatment left as I have completed eight weeks now. ?This is reassuring news and much welcomed for those awaiting or just to begin treatment. The medication I have been prescribed is Exviera dasabuvir / Viekirax ombitasvir-paritaprevir-ritonavir / Ribavirin . For all those who may be hepatitis positive, pursue the treatment as it is becoming more available, as the cost although still considerable has lowered and more health authorities are able to offer the treatment than in previous times.?For any one that may be in a state of panic as to whether they may have the virus, the worst case scenario is that even detected positive, the rate of success of cure with the new treatment I have been informed by the hep c team who kindly manage my treatment is a staggering 98% which is brilliant news the hep c community has been needing for a long time.( On hope, foundations are built ) This news is a message of hope, keep focused and whatever your circumstances I hope this news brings comfort and a renewed sense of direction.?If any one has any questions to the treatment and it's side effects, you are welcome to reply.?RegardsRobert"

"Can chronic Hepatitis B ever clear from one's DNA?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/can-chronic-hepatitis-b-ever-clear-from-one-s-dna--40668","Hi. I am 44. Last year in September after being ill for 6 weeks ( doctor's failed to diagnose the correct problem.....) I was finally diagnosed as having Hepatitis B. I live in Spain but am British. I wa told that it was now chronic and therefore I have it in my DNA. Had they diagnosed sooner ( I went to the doctor when every joint in my body became very painful after I had a high fever with major pain similar I guess to severe rheumatism) could they have given me treatment to clear the acute Hepatitis and it would not have become chronic? Now that it is chronic - is it ever possible to clear from one's system after time and without medication? I have been given very very little information here from a decidedly ""frosty"" specialist. I would also like to know if this can affect my ability to have children ie if I ever do then they can be vaccinated against this being transmitted? Any advice and support will be very much appreciated. I feel pretty scared and alone with this although my family, close friends and partner have been very supportive. It is hard for anyone to understand who doesn't have the same thing. I would like to hear from people whi may have been through or are still going through the same thing?"
"Can autoimmune hepatitis go away without treatment? Should I be concerned anymore?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/can-autoimmune-hepatitis-go-away-without-treatment-should-i-be-concerned-anymore--511526","Female, mid 20's. In late March I developed horrible upper right and lower sternum abdominal pains. At first I thought it was gas pains. However, I noticed the pains were not getting better and the pains worse. It hurt to breath. The pains would go and come throughout the day and got worse at night. I had this issue for maybe 3-4 days before going to the hospital. Also, the same day BEFORE those abdominal pains started I developed a rash on my arms and feet, a persistent cough (asthmatic) and was passing dark urine. Eventually the abdominal pains had gotten so bad I was sweating, having chills/ tremors, and looked very sickly (skin got darker). My ribs felt like they were compressing something that was combusting at the same time. It hurt like hell!! When I got to the hospital I was given an ultrasound.Kidneys normal, liver normal, pancreas normal, gallbladder normal. I was given a blood workup. Viral hEpatatis A-C negative, STD negative, and HIV negative. However my LFT test came back as ""a bit elevated"" and had ""non viral hepatitis"" as well as ""mild jaundice"". I was kept overnight and was given a autoimmune test. It came back ANA negative, Mitchondira Negative, but Smooth muscle antibody positive with 1:40 titer. I was discharged from the hospital because my pains had eased from initial arrival and was stable. My LFT test was (AlK Phos 264, ALT: 89, AST: 174, ESR: 74) upon discharge. I followed up with a different doctor for a 2nd opinion about 3-4 weeks later because the hospital wouldn't answe my questions. As of April 17th my liver function returned to normal and I am no longer testing positive for that Smooth muscle antibody test. It is now undectable. Leading my new doctor to believe I don't have that disease. As happy as I am to hear everything has mostly gone back to normal except my ESR which still slightly elevated but decreased. (Alk Phos 108, ALT: 22, AST 32, ESR: 32) I'm still having upper right abdominal discomfort. It's not as bad as it was the first time, but I'm still having some mild discomfort. Why? I told my doctor about it but he didn't seem worried. I don't respond to pain when he feels around. I can't tell him where the pain is specifically either because it's a dull discomfort. I can't pin point it. I was never diagnosed with it as I never had a liver biopsy. My liver function returned to normal before I could. It was just a working diagnosis the hospital gave me because they didn't know why it was elevated, but the GI team said a UTI can sometimes cause an elevated liver enzyme. Yet never treated me for the UTI to see if it would make a difference. It was told to just check back in 1-3 months to make sure everything is ok and that o probably caught some kind of virus that's not hepatitis. What virus could cause that? I'm hEpatatis A-C negative. I was vaccinated for A. "

So I'm sure I didn't get it when I was a kid before getting the vaccines. I am not a drug user, I didn't get any blood transfusion, I only has one sex partner and both of us were virgin before having sex with each other. How is it possible that I could be infected after finishing 5 doses of vaccines? Do you guys think my result for HBcAB could be false-positive? If not, it means I belong to one of the very rare case that the vaccine didn't work? I'm very confused and scared now because I can't know when I got it.

I came to know in 2012, when my lab test of Anti-HDV (antibody Hep. Delta Virus) came as Positive. After taking some herbal medicines for one year, my lab test of Anti-HDV became Negative in 2013. My ultrasound is normal and all other lab tests are normal. My HBsAg titre level is still high at 2069, SGPT (ALT) is 56, SGOT (AST) is 37, and Platelets in CBC is 140 x 10E9/L. My Cholesterol level is on the upper limit of normal range. What does these high SGPT, SGOT and high titre level indicate about my condition? Does it indicate any liver problems?Is my Hep. B on carrier stage and under control? Should I go through any medications or more lab tests? Your advices and feedbacks would be much appreciated.Since last two months, I am having more burps than usual, and my body digests food more quickly, I feel hungry within three hours after lunch/dinner and I always have to eat some snacks every two to three hours. But my weight is not increasing. Please also explain, is it good for my health or not?History of my Lab Tests results are as follows:In 2013:HbSAg: Positive (2069) Hep.

"Hi im 15 and live in the uk","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hi-im-15-and-live-in-the-uk-15258","Hi im Daisy and im 15 years old. I was told i had autoimmune hepatitis c about a year ago as well as having schlerosing cholangitis :cry: It started by me being really tired and losing at least a stone in weight. My mum took me to the dctors and had so many blood tests done but everything came back negative. At least two months later they told me my lfts weren't normal. I then had a liver biopsy, ultra scan and an MRI (in october and i only just got the results back two weeks ago - bloody insane) They suggested things that i had never heard of before and i was worried that i had some incurable disease. I was then later told that had hep c and schlerosing cholangitis and would have to take steroids (40g) a day and the medicine for the rest of my life. I feel better knowing what is wrong with me and hopefully it won't get in the way of me doing stuff later on in life. :wink:"

"Hi, I was diagnosed with NASH 9 months ago, following a ...","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hi-i-was-diagnosed-with-nash-9-months-ago-following-a--963","Hi, I was diagnosed with NASH 9 months ago, following a severe viral type illness 9 months previously. I had noticed I was putting on weight, my legs were becoming very 'tight' and big, I felt lethargic, my brain didn't seem to function properly and the hot flushes were unbearable - although I did manage to not rip my clothes off whilst at work!But for the continued diligence of my GP, with many blood tests, scans and refererral to a hepatologist, I don't think I would be the fit person I am to-day. When the diagnosis of fatty liver disease (NASH) was made, my GTT was around 260 (normal up to around 70!). I was told to follow a diet of no more than 4gm fat/100gm weight. I saw a dietician, which was very fortunate, as I was really struggling with what fats I should/should not be eating. Once I started on my low fat diet, cutting out all chocolate, biscuits, cakes, cheese, anything fried, olive oil (a real surprise that I wasn't allowed this), within the first week I lost approx 5pounds and the hot flushes stopped. Two weeks passed and my ankles appeared! 9 months later I have lost over two and a half stone, feel much fitter both physically and mentally and my GTT at the last appointment was down to 131 - still far too high as far as I was concerned, but my Consultant was pleased!Far from being aggrieved that I have had to give up some of my favourite treats, I am elated that I have a condition which has been diagnosed, which I can manage myself without medication, and which has lead me to feel fitter than I have for years! I have struggled to sort out exactly what I can and cannot eat - food labels can be quite confusing! However, I would be very happy to help other people who are unsure on what they should or shouldn't be eating.The main problem can be eating out. Not in 'posh' restaurants where everything is cooked from scratch, but in cafes, etc. where all the food is pre-packed, and when I say I don't want mayonnaise or butter, etc., they have nothing to offer me. Places like Starbucks are wonderful - they have introduced 'skinny' options - I just wish the supermarkets would follow suit with 'skinny muffins', although certainly the large outlets like Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury and M & S, are trying very hard to introduce many low fat, healthy options, for which I am truly grateful.The weight loss has been extremely slow - often down to one pound in 4 - 6 weeks (after the initial stone, which came off in what seemed like days!). However, I have never been disheartened, as the inches have continued to reduce, and I have gone from a size 18 to a 12/14, dependent on the make/cut. I would be happy to share my experience with others in the same position. I think diagnosis is probably the difficult issue. I could very easily have just accepted that at 52, it was my age/menopause, etc which was causing me to feel unwell, but my GP took on board the fact that I felt 'something wasn't right', and it is to her that I owe my present well being.[i:3c85043ad6]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:3c85043ad6]"
"Diagnosed with AIH after the birth of my son","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/diagnosed-with-aih-after-the-birth-of-my-son-23481","Hi everyone,I was diagnosed with AIH in Jan 2009 after the birth of my son in Nov 2008.The hospital had induced me at 38 weeks pregnant because they thought I had Obstetric Cholestasis (itching of hands/feet) which can be dangerous to the unborn baby. After the delivery I felt great and the symptoms went away.Three weeks later the itching came back even worse and I had loss of appetite and was looking slightly jaundice and this was getting worse by the day. So I went to the doctors and they did a load of blood tests and sent me home. Later that day a nurse and a doctor came to my house and admitted me to the hospital as they were concerned and needed to run further tests at the hospital to figure out what was wrong with me as the blood results were showing that something was seriously wrong with my liver.After doing more tests over that week and asking me millions of questions about my lifestyle etc. they performed a liver biopsy and started steroid treatment (Prednisolone 30mg and Azathioprine 50mg) as they were 99.9% sure that it was AIH. But I didnt get very many answers to my questions in hospital (this seems to be the same everywhere!) My biopsy results finally came back in Jan (first seen a doctor in Nov!) and they confirmed it to be AIH Type 1. They then upped my dose of steroids to 60mg because my liver function levels were worsening and have gradually been weaning me off them and are planning on keeping me on the Azathioprine only.I'm now on 15mg of Prednisolone and 50mg of Azathioprine. I'm just praying that this will stay under control and I can get off the steroids because the side effects are terrible. I have put on 2 stone since taking them and my skin is dreadfull, acne breakouts like you wouldnt believe! I feel depressed most days from everything about I guess but I have my little boy which keeps me going.xxx"

"A general NHS/GP moan and my experience of HA","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/a-general-nhs-gp-moan-and-my-experience-of-ha-23578","I have had HA for going on 7 years. Initially - after a long period of feeling really unwell and being constantly asked if I had a drink problem by my GPs which I don't and never have had - I turn yellow and spent weeks in hospital with HA. Considering my history of polyglandular autoimmune (11 years) I rather feel that someone, during routine hospital appointments and the surgery should have guessed that I have HA. I am now feeling absolutely desperate. I have had a bad reaction to every immunosuppressant prescribed to me which, due to them affecting my stomach badly, I have had to come off even when they have brought my LFT's back to normal. I have just come off prograf due to swelling legs and feet etc and generally feeling really ill. I am on 20mg (started on 60mg) prednisolone and they too are having a bad effect on me - I know I cannot come off them. I have just had another liver biopsy and was told that I have a little scarring - which amazed and delighted me - no cirrhosis which also amazed and delighted me considering the length of time it is taking to get this condition under control and that if I could tolerate an immunosuppressant I would eventually get well again. The prognosis if they do not find one I can tolerate is not good. I too have a GP who knows nothing of this chronic condition and really does not want to ar*ed finding anything out about it and just keeps telling me to ask the consultants at the hospital and we all know what that means in the UK. Constant battles with jumped up secretaries, conflicting information and being treated like a bloody nuisance for having the temerity to ask questions. Sometimes I feel like a boat adrift as sea - I truly have no confidence in my GPs or the hospital anymore. Thank you for reading this general moan."
