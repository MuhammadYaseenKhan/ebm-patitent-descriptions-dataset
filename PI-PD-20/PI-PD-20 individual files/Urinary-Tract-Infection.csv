"Urinary Tract Infection","Constant UTI, no bacterial growth. 6+ months.","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/constant-uti-no-bacterial-growth-6-months--668548","Hi, Situation is as follows:Cystoscopy in 2015, uretha dilation because of 6 infections within 9 months. Told I have a large bladder.Infections come back every now and then until late 2017.I get generalised symptoms of frequency, stinging, kidney back pain, nausea, white cells and blood in my urine.Had a CT scan and ultrasound to see if I had kidney stones. Negative result.Fast forward to now, had 13 courses of antibiotics in 2018, have been infected with constant symptoms for last three months especially. Never have grown bacteria on my samples sent to the lab. Been banned from having sex, caffeine and alcohol which I all comply with. Got married in May and that's a bit of a bummer on our relationship ATM. I got signed off for a month and a half and am awaiting my cystoscopy on August 9th. More than anything, do other people have the pain of utis but grow no bacteria also? I don't remember a time in the last few months I haven't had white cells in my urine. Have been on amoxicillin which did nothing, trimithiprime which again, nothing and now on a daily course of nitrofuratoin. Apparently I shouldn't respond to antibiotics but they help a bit. Please tell me I'm not alone, this is so incredibly frustrating and nobody in my private life gets utis. My dad's got spongy kidneys and his mother had kidney disease but nothing relating to the bladder. From a very upset, tired and mentally drained 24 year old... thank you in advance if you respond. X"

"Urinary Tract Infection","Possible embedded UTI?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/possible-embedded-uti--724961","I'm 22 years old and started with symptoms when I was 17. It started with frequency and then a few days later I developed an uncomfortable feeling of pressure over my bladder. I went to walk in centre and there were white blood cells in my urine and they prescribed me a 3 day course of antibiotics. I didn't feel any better after that so went to my GP and they gave me a 5 day course and sent urine off for culture (came back negative for anything.) Over the years, I've been getting flare ups every so often of either random frequency/urgency or the pelvic discomfort feeling with frequency. My urine has been tested many times but has only ever shown white blood cells. I'm currently seeing a urologist who thinks it's interstitial cystitis but when I came across info on embedded UTIs I thought it could be a possibility. I never had any bladder issues before my first 'UTI' at 17. I'm not sure if this could have caused it but I was on the last few days on my period and I didn't change my sanitary towel for 2 days I think (disgusting I know! Don't ask 😕) shortly after that the symptoms started. Could it be possible that all my issues are actually stemming from an embedded UTI? Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

"Urinary Tract Infection","UTI for 2 months - long term antibiotic or another solution?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/uti-for-2-months-long-term-antibiotic-or-another-solution--713738","Hi Everyone,This is a bit of a long story but please bare with me as I am at my wits' end and would appreciated any advice/feedback!About 2 months ago I developed a UTI while on holiday in France (I live in London, UK). I went to see a GP who did a dipstick test and confirmed that there was blood and pus in my urine. She gave me 10 days of antibiotics (Cefixime) which I took (although admittedly, I think i missed a couple of antibiotics).After I stopped taking these, I still had symptoms so went to see a GP who prescribed me with 7 days of Nitrofurantoin. I couldn't get an appointment with my NHS GP that day so I paid to go and see a GP privately. They didn't do a dipstick test or send a urine sample off to a lab - they just went by the symptoms I described to them and gave me the antiobiotics.After finishing this course, I still felt that the infection hadn't gone away. I got an appointment with my NHS GP who sent my urine off to be cultured. It came back with a high level of bacteria and pus cells but no growth. My GP referred me to a urologist who sent me off for various tests (full bloods, cytology, scans) - everything came back normal. I also spoke to him about my most recent urine culture and he said that as there was no growth, he would not put me on antiobiotics. Instead he asked me to take D Mannose and Cranberry Tablets three times a day.I tried this for a couple of weeks but still didn't feel any better so I went back to my GP who did another urine culture and sent it off to the lab. Again, it came back with high bacteria and pus but no growth. She prescribed me another 7 day course of Nitrofurantoin, which I took, but still didn't feel any better.On Friday I went to see a urogynecologist. He suggested putting me on a long-term low dose of antibiotics - probably Nitrofurantoin. One of my main concerns is whether this will work given that i have already been on Nitrofurantoin twice (albeit a higher dose for a shorter amount of time - 7 days), and this clearly didn't work? It's also concerning that the last urine culture I had said that my infection was sensitive to Nitrofurantoin, which I took for 7 days, and the UTI still didn't clear up! The urogynecologist also did a very brief examination and said that the outside of my vagina looked quite red/sore and suggested using a thrush cream on it.Just by way of background I am a 34 year old female. I had recurrent UTIs in my 20s for a few years (brought on by intercourse). The past year or so, I have probably had 5 UTIs and I'm not sure what has brought them on as I have not been sexually active.My main symptoms are pressure on my bladder and pain when urinating. My vagina also feels very sore and irritated.I just wondered if anyone had any advice in relation to treating a very stubborn UTI that clearly won't go away? Are long-term antibiotics a good solution? I'm just worried because although I have had MANY UTIs before, I have never had one that has lasted this long. They have always cleared up after the first round of antibiotics.Thank you for taking the time to read this and as I've said before, any guidance would be greatly appreciated!x"

Uroligist said my kidney stone had grown and was causing the problems.I had lithotripsy last week and miraculously my stone busted up perfectly. Im peeing tiny grains of sand with no flank pain. But my uti symptoms are still there.It burns not at all when i pee, but just a contant burning while not peeing. Im chugging water so im obviously peeing often. But im burning all the time.Im terrified i have interstitial cystitis since i keep showing i have no infection. I have no stomach/pelvic pain or anything else. Just a constant burning sensation like ive held my urine too long (im not) and pressure like i need to pee even when ive just went.Is this from the kidney stone or IC?

It has been 6 months of weird urinary symptoms that are mysterious. I don't have insurance right now and have serious doctor phobia. It started with a ripping pain at the end of urinating. It would linger for a while after urinating with some itching feeling too. My urine was cloudy. I noticed an improvement in symptoms when I excessively drank water so that made me think it was dehydration. I can never keep the symptoms at bay permanently unless I drink large amounts of water which then makes me urinate all night long. I have no frequency or urgency beyond what results from drinking so much water. I didn't think I had discharge but I do feel a dropping sensation when I first pee as if maybe there was an accumulation of something there. Nothing has appeared on tissue or under garments though. I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary when I inspected my urethra. It all seems to be my urethra. I feel fine between peeing. I am worried about urethra cancer and now I'm worried that not treating whatever this is for so many months will turn into cancer. Everything I read sounds like what I have is urethra cancer. I'm only 37. It also says prolonged inflammation of the urethra causes that cancer which is essentily incurable.sorry, terrified 😦"

I've tried every antibiotic, and end up just becoming resistant to them.I had bladder re-implantation when I was younger due to having kidney reflux.Recently I've been offered this bladder treatment using a catheter, its a solution that lines my bladder. I already had a cystoscopy last year and I remember how ill i was after that. I just wondered if anyone knows more information about this? The hospital have hardly told me any information, and I have to make a decision by tomorrow whether I want it. I literally got the phone call today about an appointment. The treatment begins with the letter H but I cannot remember for the life of me what it's called.With working on a forensic mental health unit for male offenders, a catheter is not ideal for me. Especially if I'm restraining people and this is my dream job, and I was already off sick with pneumonia over summer, so I cannot afford more time off.I was aware they were going to put me on the medication Hiprex one, as apparently its the same as the solution.If anyone has any information about this treatment, I'd be really grateful."

In april this year i noticed a light 'bother' in the region of my prostate, like a small cramp. I have done different blood and urine tests between april and june, that were clear every time (no cancer, no std's, no bacteria).Since it was not clearing up, i went to see a urologist. He noticed signs of infection through echography (fluid in the prostate) and prescribed me Cefuroxim for 3 weeks. These have worked in a first time, but after 3 weeks the bother came back. He then suggested we test everything over again, which resulted in the sudden discovery of enterococcus bacteria in both sperm and urine in july. Even though it was very mysterious that the tests i had done before didn't show anything and now they did, i was relieved to hear that they had find something that explained the bother. Urologist prescribed me Levofloxacine first, but i had to stop after a few days due to painful tendons (is an uncommon side effect). So we changed the treatment to Amoxiciline for 3 weeks.Within the first 10 days i felt great because it had a clear effect on the pain in my prostate, despite the typical side effects of antibiotics (occasional diarrhea, weakness, light nausea). But after that everything turned worse. I suddenly started having acute diarrhea, heavy abdominal pains, and a UTI that went from tip of the penis to prostate (more of a burning sensation than the 'cramp' i had before), swelling of the lymph nodes and light muscular pain and weakness.While continuing treatment, i went to see the urologist again. We tested everything and the results were even more mysterious: enterococcus gone, no sign of a possible std, no HIV, not even high levels of white blood cells. We did find fluid around my testicles on the echography. The conclusion was that my body had no more resistance after having taken so many antibiotics on such a short term... My treatment with Amoxiciline came to an end a few days later and only the heavy diarrhea and abdominal pains went away. Today, a week after having stopped antibiotics, I am still having painful swollen lymph nodes (throat, under my arms and at the base of my legs), muscle weakness, bad physical shape, burning sensation in my penis and light swelling of the testicles and nothing seems to be changing.Does anyone here have experience with this kind of mysterious UTI?Here are some thoughts i had: candida outbreak, mumples, false negative HIV, toxoplasmosis?Thank you for your insights!"

(e.g. E Coli, Klebsiella, Enterococcus Faecalis.) Using antibiotics as a prophylactic is likely to result in antibiotic resistance and at least two antibiotics (Cipro & Nitro) appear to be causing neuropathic problems affecting my bladder and foot.I have serious concerns about both catheters and antibiotics relating antibiotic resistance and potentially serious adverse neurological effects.I wonder if Sacral Nerve Stimulation (SNS) might be a better option.I would be interested to hear from anyone else who is having a similar experience and/or has had experience of SNS for urine retention."

I did notice an immediate difference in the pain when I was taking the antibiotics. However, by the 4th day of treatment I noticed My infection stopped responding to the antibiotics. So I just assumed maybe it's residual burning and irritation from having a UTI for awhile. Plus I thought once I finish the course maybe it needed time to kick in so waited a few weeks to see if there would be difference. So about 3-4 weeks later I decided to go back to the doctor to have my urine retested as the burning would come and go and was still causing me slight discomfort. My results came back today that I still have a UTI. Apparently it's the SAME bacteria from the first time. My lab culture says its ""1,000-9,000 cocci gram positive isolated"". I'm glad he bacteria hasn't grown back to the 10,000-50,000 amount I was seeing on my culture before after so many weeks. Why didn't the antibiotics kill off ALL of the bacteria? What do I do now?

Eventually I stopped going to the doctor and whenever I got another one id just drink loads of water and take painkillers as needed and it would clear up on its own within a few days. I had an ultrasound of my bladder and kidneys about 5 years ago which was normal at that time. The past few years it seemed to have settled and I hardly ever felt like I had a UTI. But for about 6 months or so now I feel like I might have had one, but just not had the symptoms. The only thing that has brought it to my attention is the smell of my urine (TMI sorry). It has a really strong smell and often smells like fish. I work in a hospital so I do a urine dipstick test regularly and for the last 6 months or so every single time I’ve tested my urine it’s positive for nitrites and leukocytes. Some (but not all) of the time it has +1 protein too. I basically feel like I’ve had a constant UTI for about 6 months, but just haven’t had the pain or any of the other symptoms (except the smell) if that’s possible? I’m just wondering what I should do about it. Since it’s not really bothering me I haven’t been to the doctors as I didn’t really see the point. But I’m wondering if it could be causing damage that I don’t know about if there has been an infection there all that time. Is it ok to just ignore it if it’s not causing me any problems?

I had been swimming/took a bath/had my period when it started so I couldnt really tell what had caused it. After my period was done I went to the ER for burning and lower abdominal pain/pelvic pain on the left side. She couldnt see anything. Vaginal PH was 5.0 and Leucocytes in Urinstix were plus 2. She said it is unspecific vaginitis and gave me Cefuroxime/Metronidazole 500 mg each twice daily for7 days and Fluomizin for the vagina (A cream against bacterial Vaginosis in Germany). I took it and it got better for around 5 days then the burning came back. I couldnt tell if it was urethral or vaginal. I felt some tiny bumps then I went to the ER and a resident told me it was Herpes!. I freaked out but wasnt convinced. I went to a specialist she said that is vestibular papillomatosis and definitely not herpes and that the burning is just irritation and it ll go away on its own. For the next 2 days I had horrible burning from my urethra especially AFTER peeing and pelvic pain on the left side and while peeing I sometimes felt as if a string is being pulled on the left side. I ended up in the ER again. Blood was all good. Urinstix showed leucocytes plus 3. The doctor said it could be a UTI and gave me an aminopenicillin antibiotic (it is widely used in Germany and scandanavian countreis). The pelvic pain is a bit better but the burning is not and I am so desperate and driving myself crazy. It is the second day of the antibiotic and I should take it for 3 days.My questions to u guys: Can UTIs burn that badly? especially AFTER peeing more than during?. Do u recommend any home remedies for the burning?. How long did it last in ur case? Could this be a yeast infection without any discharge?"

"Urinary Tract Infection","Urethral Issues, possible UTI","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/urethral-issues-possible-uti-692814","I'm a female and on about the 20th of December I made a huge mistake of shaving my pubic area with hair conditioner in the bath tub. I was mentally under a lot of stress, exhausted and restless during this time due to exams (possibly this contributed to weakening my immune system?). The following morning I noticed a slight discomfort, a burning sensation in my urethra after peeing. I thought this was odd because I have been drinking water continually for past two weeks leading up so I knew I was not dehydrated. The pain continued after I peed for about two hours, so I continued to drink more water in hopes to flush whatever it was out of my system. That night I woke up to vaginal cramping and watery discharge, that's when I knew something was wrong. After a little research I assumed that I was experiencing a yeast infection due to the discharge and discomfort, so I got over the counter AZO cream that you take once for treatment. However, the following days the burning sensation is my urethra was only getting worse, even though i was strictly drinking cranberry juice and water, so I invested in AZO uti pain relief and cranberry pills instead and took them religiously. The pain was hardly subdued and it felt more like it was leaving my urethra dry and faintly burnt. For about a week the symptoms went away, but they came back full force so I went back to my regimen of cranberry tabs, water and uti relief, even though it was not doing much. The symptoms have been on and off, but this past weekend I noticed that my urine was cloudy with an unusual odor, along with slight abdomen pain, which I researched was a sign of a possible kidney infection. I met with my doctor on Tuesday to get a diagnosis but surprisingly my urine results came back negative. She decided to give a vaginal examine. After a cotton swab she said I had a ""little"" yeast in my vagina so she prescribed me an antibiotic for a yeast infection. Although i felt frustrated, because i have not experienced any vaginal itchiness or burning that would correlate to a yeast infection, I took it anyways with claims that it will give relief within 24 hours. It has been two days and my urine will sometimes come out cloudy still and the pain I get from peeing has returned, and i feel the urge to urinate frequently even though I just went. I doubt it's a uti at this point but I am unsure of what it could be."

Since then I have not had a single UTI and it has been 1.5 years. However I do still now sometimes get urine infection-like pain especially if I dont drink enough water so I keep myself topped up on water often. What I find really works to get rid of that annoying uncomfortable pain is to COLD blow dry my private area focusing on my uretha opening and/or squirting cold water on it via a sports cap bottle. Also to note for info, before I had a cystoscopy I used to be prescribed antibiotics for many years which starting making me resistant to anti-biotics, so instead after researching I began to use powdered cystitis relief cranberry sachets mixed with water (can be bought from supermarkets - tescos, sainsburys). These sachets were horrible to drink so instead I bought big empty capsules and poured the powder into the capsules to drink with water to avoid tasting the horrible metal tasting drink. I told my doctor about this and he was surprised why this worked for me.Ps. I am a 28yr old female.Happy to help if you have questions. There is always light at the end of the tunnel!"

(He wanted to give me an injection of antibiotics to get me started off strong, but they only had a kind containing an allergen on hand, so I ended up not getting that shot.)The pills seem to be helping with the basic UTI - urination isn't painful anymore, at least - but my back pain is getting worse. It's like a constant throbbing on my right flank, and then randomly my lower back will spasm quite painfully for a minute before settling back into the throb.I don't know if I should be concerned that it seems to be getting worse at this point, or if it's just too early in the medication cycle for the antibiotics to have kicked in... I'm wondering if I need to go back to the doctor first thing in the morning - this office doesn't let you call and speak to your doctor or a nurse; you have to go in for an appointment - or if I should give the antibiotics a bit more time."

This morning, I’ve had a lot less pain peeing and less feeling like I need to pee constantly. But I’ve started getting pain in my left side of my abdomen.. Maybe the colon area? I’ve heard of a UTI infection spreading to the kidneys without proper treatment. I was wondering if this can spread to other areas of the body too? Not sure why my side is throbbing in pain. I’ve also been taking painkillers like ibuprofen and codeine.... Maybe the colon pain is down to all the pills? I really want antibiotics to be a last resort. I’ll take them if I have to.

Everytime I visit the doctor they prescribe me the same antibiotics and don't ever seem to take any concern to them being prescribed to me on a very high basis. I have even asked my doctors each time if there are any other possible treatments I can look at long term to help deflect these infections, to which each doctor suggests ""if the antibiotics dont work, come back"". They have never failed to free me of the current pain but for the infection to return a couple of months later? I have heard of long term prescriptions, does any one have any experience with these? I am desperate at this point, i have a active sex life which is also being affected, i am afraid on occasion to be with my partner in fear I'll get an infection even with following suggested protocol, showering before, showering after, and staying dormant on the toliet each time after sex to urinate whatever I can.

During this time it was discovered that I am very allergic to Sulfa medication. Not fun. Anyhow, my current concern has me scared. Two weeks ago on a Wednesday my husband had to drive me to the walk-in clinic because of a bladder infection. It got bad fast, with blood and clots in my urine. They testing my sample and gave me Macrobid twice a day for 5 days. By that Saturday morning, I couldn’t see blood anymore but still passed a clot now and then. But my back/side started hurting. So I when back to the same clinic. He showed me the print off that stated I had an E. Coli infection and tested against antibiotics I was on the right medication. So to continue taking it and make an appointment with my primary doctor at some point during the week. The on Monday morning (last Monday) I took my last pill. Still continuing to drink as much fluids as I could handle, still not sleeping very much at all. Still had the crazy urgency... not every 20-40 secs but once I felt I had to go, within seconds it became a crazy issue were it felt I might not make it to the bathroom. Fast forward to Wednesday morning at 4 am, I woke up with extrem pain, soak with sweat and had to run to the bathroom. BAM bright red blood and the clots were so large I think I may have torn myself. I could leave the bathroom longer then 5 minutes without panicking to get back. This continued till about 6:15 when everyone else in my house started waking up. My back/right side was hurting so badly I couldn’t sit. The pain to pee was so bad. I dropped to my knees a few times. My husband called my mom to come get me and rush me to ER, and told me he would meet me there once the kids left fo school. ER was crazy, they got me in fast, gave pain meds and started IV for Cipro 7 days. Gave me CT to check for kidney stones, I didn’t. They found I have multiple infections from my kidneys down. Sent a referral from the hospital for a urologist given my history and these past two weeks. I just finished the last pill last night. The urgency is still unreal the second I calmly feel I should go, seconds later it’s panic. My lower back is still so sore and my middle back to right side is bad. And the pain is starting to slowly get worse and worse since I haven’t had any meds today and the urgency is also getting a bit worse. I’m starting to get scared. I e never had an infection this powerful before. And overall just feel unwell, even have a sinus infection and a croup sounding cough and my wrists and knee hurt badly too.

"Urinary Tract Infection","New Member Questions","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/new-member-questions-670565","Hi!I am brand new here & have several questions.First, though, a little history...I am a 61 year old female not sexually active who has suffered from recurrent UTIs for over 40 years. Sex was often the culprit, but for the past couple years I have been abstinent.In the past few years my UTIs began to become asymptomatic UNTIL my bacteria levels were pretty high. THEN I would have urgency, foul odor, back pain, urgency & burning.It would take an average of 2-4 rounds of antibiotics to clear the infection.Last year I had a UTI I thought had been resolved, but it got into my bloodstream causing sepsis and gangrene. Since then I have insisted I have a urinalysis done every other month to make sure I am clean since I am asymptomatic.Now to my questions!I tested positive for bacteria & squamous cells in my recent test. I got the results before my doctor so when I called office about treatment they didnt have report in my chart. The medical assistant told me 'some bacteria' in your urine is normal, but dr. would look over report and get back to me.Is it true some bacteria in your urine is normal?2nd, these squamous cells reportedly can come from vagina & what I may think is a UTI could be yeast or vaginitis...not a UTI?3) If it is yeast or vaginitis is the treatment not with antibiotics?4) Has anyone been treated for UTIs with estrogen cream? My PCP is recommending it because of my frequent infections. He said post menopausal women often have thinning of the vaginal walls due to lack of estrogen which leads to both vaginal infections & UTIs.I appreciate any input.Thank you.Kathy"

"Urinary Tract Infection","Urethra","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/urethra-671725","Hello,I am a female and I am 24 years old. This might be a little long so I apologize in advance. Around August 2017, I had my first UTI ever and I had no idea what is was until I talked to my roommate. I was told that the normally go away on their own and take to AZO until it does, well it didn’t go away on its own. So I woke up one morning before work and I could barely stand because I was in so much pain due to my kidneys. I went to the ER and they gave me Antibiotics in an IV and then a prescription for antibiotics for another one to two weeks. I took the entire amount and I felt a lot better but then after a two weeks, I got another UTI and since then it has been an issue up to this point. The only way that I can describe the pain I am feeling is that of a UTI, my only pain is in my Urethra. I have burning and discomfort constantly now. I have been tested for all STDS more than once and the results have come back negative every time. At this point I have been in so much pain that I decided to see a Urologist, the first one I saw pretty much put me on every kind of antibiotic she could thing of for short periods of time because when my urine is tested, there is some kind of bacteria there but when it is sent to get cultured nothing appears. I had been with this doctor until June but nothing she had done had helped me up to that point. I then decided to change doctors because my previous one had put me on a hundred pills and nothing was helping. I would like to say that up until last year I was very healthy person and things just changed then. My previous doctor did take a scope and insert it in my urethra to bladder (sorry I don’t know the medical term) and noticed that a part of my bladder seemed to be “gravely” which she associated with a bladder infection. But after so many antibiotics nothing changed. So back to my new doctor, I saw here in June and she said I have a low grade bacterial infection in my bladder which will take 3-6 months to cure. Because I do have bacteria in my urine, she believes that there isn’t enough bacteria to culture but enough to irritate my bladder and urethra. She said it would take about 6 to 8 weeks to feel a difference. Currently she has me own SMZ-TMP 400-80MG and PHENAZOPYRID. She also had me take a single dose of AZITHROMYCIN 500 MG (two tablets). My worry is that I still do not feel better and I am on week 4, after I took the AZITHROMYCIN which was on Tuesday 07/31, I felt better but today (08/02/2018) I have the uncomfortable and burning feeling again. I am just at a loss and I have called her and she keeps saying just wait it out, it takes a while but I am worried that it is not going away. I will say that I have had bladder tests done, and my previous doctor had me on bladder relaxers because she believed I had an over active bladder (that cramped a lot) she didn’t do any test but I did do a bladder test recently and it showed my bladder was “slower” then normal but she believed it was due to the bladder relaxers. I do want to say that the only pain I have is in my Urethra, I no longer have sex and I do not drink alcohol or caffeine. Please help. "

"Urinary Tract Infection","UTI-like symtoms, negative test results?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/uti-like-symtoms-negative-test-results--592904","I'm 23 and I've been struggling with this for a couple years but I've never been able to do anything about it because my test results ALWAYS, always come back negative. Essentially I have every symptom of a UTI but no proof that one exists. I've researched STIs/STDs for fear of those but I have no other symptoms other than extreme pain when I pee and/or if I have sex. It's hard to narrow down when my symptoms seem to pop up because it just comes in waves--for example, I could be alright for WEEKS before another episode happens, or I could go a day and be fine but then have it pop up. The other weird symptom I have (TMI) is that once I try to pee, if I've already tried a couple minutes before there obviously won't be any liquid to pee out, so I'm just struggling with my body's desire to pee and it's painful because there's nothing THERE to pee. Sometimes if I can get into weird positions I can pee a little at a time for relief but this obviously interrupts daily life a lot. I've been to the ER, I've had multiple labs run, I've taken antibiotics a couple of years ago (which now thay I live a more holistic lifestyle am kind of against now)--I was even taking the D Mannose supplement to see if that would calm my system down. A weird thing that happened with me a couple of months ago was an allergic reaction I had to taking an antibiotic called Minocycline--my derm had prescribed it for my acne. (This is why I am now holistic.) My health coach believes that this antibiotic wiped my system of ALL bacteria, so my thought was maybe that my pH levels are still off? But that STILL wouldn't make any sense because I've had this problem for the past 4 years As a side note, I do take care of myself down there--regularly washing (no soaps though!) and no douching either as that's bad for the pH too I believe. I've even tried to researching to see if it's the shape of my urethra that's the problem, or to see if it could be something deeper like a kidney infection and/or bladder infection. I'm so lost and sick of being in pain, please if you have any idea what this could be please help me! "

This will be the six time I've had to take antibiotics this year. THIS YEAR. I only ever had twice a year before this. I got the contraceptive implant in my arm earlier on this year in February after gaining a new sexual partner early January. Sex was more frequent in January than it has been after getting the implant, so I don't understand why they would start happening. I had three from February - April. During April all of my results came back negative so I had to fight it on my own. I did so, but during this time my first period after getting the implant in February came and lasted for about 10 days. This bout lasted about 2 weeks until it finally went away. My next period came about early June and lasted for the normal seven days. HOWEVER, two weeks later after the end of the last period i got my period during another UTI that also came back negative and yet showed up with Leukocytes and blood. My doctor theorises that my sample was way too diluted as I had had over a liter of water before the sample was taken. I was given trimethoprim which never works for me, and demanded keflex two days later when symptoms became unbearable. The keflex started to work within 12 hours like it has in the past in my experience. This is now the tenth day on that period, and my UTI has once again come back. I do believe the last UTI i got was because I did not go to the bathroom after sex and forgot to take the antibiotic I am supposed to take after intercourse. Yesterday, I had sex again but this time peed and showered. however I forgot to take the antibiotic. I had felt symptom free for like four days before it came back. Can anyone help me?

"Urinary Tract Infection","Natural Remedies for UTI","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/natural-remedies-for-uti-665428","Hello all! I’ve struggled with UTI’s a couple times in the last few years and every time they’re unbearably painful and cause a lot of stress and disrupt in my life. All previous times I’ve ended up rushing to the emergency room and getting whatever antibiotics they choose to pump into me, anything to get rid of the pain. I just got a uti a few days ago while traveling in rural Guatemala, far from immediate medical care. I’ve had enough uti’s to notice the symptoms while they’re faint, before it gets extremely painful. I knew I wouldn’t have the option of medical care so I went into survival mode, trying to figure out the best alternatives to antibiotics. Over the next day and into the night I ate about 3 cloves of raw garlic (a known natural antibiotic), I took shots of apple cider vinegar (full of probiotics, boosts immune system and much more), drank kefir (more probiotics and other health boosts!), took vitamin c supplements, and drank turmeric, ginger, lemon elixirs. Now I didn’t think it would work because I’ve never had uti pain go away without medication. However, that night, after doing all of these things, the pain started subsiding drastically within an hour. The following few days, I repeated all of these things and was able to get rid of my UTI fully without any medication. I don’t know about you guys, but I prefer to avoid antibiotics when I can. There are so many side effects that come with artificial medicine. Not to mention, you could get rid of your UTI with antibiotics, yet replace it with a yeast infection... which is a common side effect to antibiotics. I felt so envigorated, healthy, strong, and powerful... knowing that I could beat this terrible ailment with purely natural sources. I rarely go online and post my opinion. But I thought this was an important thing to share with women out there, because I know others are going through the same thing I am. "

","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/uti-related-to-menstrual-cycle-contraception--664953","Please be advised that this discussion will be rather long, but I have some interesting symptoms that I would like to discuss with anyone who can relate or simply has an input. I've grown up with urinary tract infections my whole life but never really had a SERIOUS issue. Always cure with antibiotics (Keflex, Trimethoprim never worked). This year I started a new relationship in January, and ended up getting the contraceptive implant in my arm in February. Before this, there were no issues and sex was more frequent BEFORE getting the implant. Please keep that in mind.I started getting weird symptoms in February-March that felt like the beginning of urinary tract infections. With my history, most doctors just gave me the antibiotics and sent me on my way. However in April I had such intense UTI like pain it scared me so much and cultures were coming back negative with no indication of anything causing them. This obviously scared me as my doctor has told me about interstitial cystitis and it was the last thing that I wanted. It scared me so much. Eventually after three weeks the intermittent pain flares passed and I was able to go back to work. I saw a specialist who found no symptoms of interstitial cystitis when I went in to see him and actually informed me that although a urine sample may have bacteria in it, the sample can still give a negative result as there may not be enough bacteria to classify it as an infection. As a result he gave me a low dose of keflex to take after intercourse. During this intermittent pain, my period lasted for 10 days!My next period after this was perfectly normal and exactly 28 days after, which is very normal for me. I've always had a relatively perfect cycle. Recently, last Monday, I had intercourse but forgot to go to the bathroom after. As someone who is experienced with UTI's I'm ashamed I let myself just fall asleep. I also forgot to take the antibiotic. I went to the doctor on the Thursday when the symptoms started to pick up. He did a dip test and my urine came up with white blood cells. He sent it off for analysis and gave me trimethoprim even though I said it never worked. And of course, on Saturday, the symptoms got so bad I had to rush back to the doctor only to find that the sample I gave on Thursday showed up with 'no significant growth'. I did another sample and I had to demand that this doctor dip test it - which found white blood cells were still present. This concerned me. I also understand that white blood cells also show up with interstitial cystitis. Freaking out, I demanded Keflex as I was not convinced there was no infection. I was given 500mg 3x a day. Keep in mind this doctor I was suspicious about. She wasn't going to send this new sample off for testing, and even left the lid off it for a prolonged period of time which as a Zoology graduate, I know is a big NO NO with any biological sample. Of course, within 24 hours of taking the first Keflex antibiotic my symptoms began to subside and I've felt very comfortable ever since. I've had no influx of pain like I had experienced. Yesterday, I just got my period again with nasty cramps 2 weeks after the end of the last one, which is not normal. As I said I have always had a perfect 28 day cycle with no cramps.None of this, including the irregular periods, ever happened before i got the contraceptive implantFrom what I understand, if it was an interstitial cystitis flare the antibiotics would not have made a difference at all as there is no bug to treat. I have not yet been diagnosed with interstitial cystitis as it is being investigated. Taking into consideration the information I have given you, I was wondering what everyone thought of my experience? Has anyone else experienced a correlation between UTI or interstitial cystitis flares and contraception and/or menstrural cycles? I would be very interested to hear any opinions. "

I think it was 1 week later (25.5?) I started getting the feeling where after I pee, I feel like there's a tiny bit left right at the entrance of my urethra but usually nothing more comes out and I do feel like I'm completely emptying my bladder every time. I assumed it was a UTI and stupidly waited 2 weeks. On the 8th this month I finally went to the nurse - the symptom wasnt worse or better but I was starting to panic about nerve damage from ads. She said I had a UTI (3 things showed up on the stick I forgot exactly what, plus high temperature) and was treated with an antibotic beginning with N?It was a 3 day course (took me 4 days because I started in the evening) but I was no better at all. I went back on 12.6 and got trimiphrim (sorry can't spell it) for 5 days. I was starting to feel somewhat better on the 2nd day and then I stupidly had protected sex (with my long term partner) on the 4th day.. it didn't last long though because I had burning pain (I'm not sure if that was related to the UTI though because it was my 2nd period day and I'm usually more sensitive as well as I don't think there was enough lube). The rest of the day and yesterday (last antibiotic) I feel even worse! I feel so stupid for having sex during a UTI! And now today I still have the same stuck feeling. That day I had sex I also strained to pee alot afterwards (to see if I could get the stuck feeling out) and since then the rest of my urethra feels itchy/aroused and a dull ache sometimes. I'm starting to wonder if it's even a UTI because surely after 2 courses I should be better now?Anyway my questions are:Do I need more of the same antibiotic since it was working until I stupidly had sex?Do I need a different antibiotic?If everything comes back clear (I'm seeing the doctor either tomorrow or Wednesday), what does it mean that I still have symptoms?Is it nerve damage?Other symptoms:Temperature ranging from 36.5c-38cSide acheSince attempting sex:Almost constant burningDiscomfort under belly buttonRandom itching/aroused feeling in rest of urethra (behind pubic bone)Better in mornings and worse throughout daySorry this is long and if it doesn't make sense, my anxiety has taken over my life since withdrawing, my head is all over the place and my thoughts are coming at like 100mph but on the outside I'm such a zombie. My biggest fear that's taken over my life for 2 years now is the fear of PGAD (persistent genital arousal disorder), Pundendal neuralgia, intistial cystitis and nerve damage. And now I feel like I've finally gotten them so yeah I'm very anxious and suicidal. "

I wanted to share my experience to help calm my anxiety and hopefully relieve someone else's frustrations.I am a 33 year old active female with healthy weight/ blood sugar/blood pressure. I am a former social smoker and have 2-3 beers a week Other than UTIs, I have had zero health issues in my three decades on this planet. My first UTI occured at 17 after I became sexually active. Between the ages of 17 and 30, I have probably had 10 UTIs that responded very quickly to antibiotics. None of these UTIs occurred in close proximity to one another. I also don't think anything was cultured.When I was 28, I had visible blood in my urine with zero pain. I went to an urgent care thinking a UTI was coming and by some miracle I was getting an advanced notice. No such luck. I was quickly referred to a urologist who did a CT with contrast, Cystoscopy, blood tests and urine tests. All came back clear. The multiple appointments and tests happened over a month or so and the bleeding stopped . It never happened again until 2018, but I'll get to that soon. As a side note, I can't tell you how many times someone asked if I was sure it was coming from that hole!Fast forward to October 2015 when I started dating my now husband and I wake up with that all too familiar UTI feeling. I went to urgent care, had high leukocytes and small microscopic hematuria; no culture was done. I was given antibiotics and symptoms cleared in 24 hours . From October 2015 to 2018, I had five more ""UTIs."" Only three were cultured. One was negative, one was positive for E. Coli (25K CFU)and one was positive for Streptococcis Viridans group (100K CFU). Strep is considered normal microflora and therefore the test was deemed contaminated. I am a pro at clean catch, but I guess I was off my game. For the strep one (late May 2018), I was treated with Macrobid and was given enough pills for the standard 100mg 2x/day for 5 days and a post-coital prophalaxis dose. After 5 days, my symptoms were gone. I was reluctant to start taking a daily antibiotic but I gave in after a new symptom developed. A little less relevant information is that I do all the basic hygiene spiel I've heard 25+ times. I eat cleaner than 95% of Americans. I take d-mannose daily. I take a Urinary Tract specific probiotic. I drink a gallon of water a day (no exaggeration). I am negative for every STD known to man. I know what Interstital Cystitis is and I would hardly classify my ""UTIs"" as debilitating as the stories I've read. After my last UTI, I started taking d-mannose, apple cider vinegar (diluted in 1/2 cup water) and a garlic supplement right before I go to bed so it sits in my bladder all night. On May 30th, 2018, I began having asymptomatic blood in my urine... AGAIN. I'm not sure if this is related to the frequent UTIs that have plagued me for the last 2.5 years especially the one I had finished treating 5 days prior to bleeding onset. I noticed a bit of blood on the toilet paper and paid extra attention to my stream of my next pee. Sure enough, my stream was clear until the end and I got a few drops of bright red blood. This continued May 31st, June 1st and June 2nd. I am happy to report that on June 3rd and 4th, I only peed a bit of blood first thing in the morning and today, June 5th, I'm all clear. I'm hoping it was the d-mannose/acv/garlic cocktail sitting in my just healed bladder. I have an appointment with a urologist Friday, June 8th, 2018 and to say I'm scared is an understatement. I will keep everyone updated. I know it's unlikely I'll get a definitive answer, but at least I'll get cancer/not cancer distinction.

I've been keeping in mind I recently got into a new relationship early January and thought this was from frequent sex. However, my boyfriend and I were much more sexually active in the first month of our relationship compared to now, and I didn't get any infections until early february. Because of these infections, 3 of them I've had Keflex (Cephalexin) for which always successfully got rid of the infection. However I'm worried about bacterial resistance which is my biggest fear so the doctor I saw today gave me trimethoprim. I, however, have not touched it. I have noticed that this time with ural, lemon water, cranberry tablets, the pain has actually not gotten worse within the last six hours and has in fact helped a lot with pain. So I was therefore wondering if its possible that people can get rid of UTI's through care and patience rather than antibiotics? Even if you've treated them with antibiotics in the past?

Avoid femfresh intimate products2. double void when going to toilet3. drink plenty 4. avoid fizzy drinks5. use Dmannose6. limit alcohol7. avoid sugary dieti tried before my Uti's ended potassium citrate but whether this was the cure i don't know. i have also tried Urva Ursi but please read up about this as it can be quite toxic.it should be used sparingly. It is so nice to be without infections although i am not taking things for granted. I found Urologists and Gp's not to have the answer to infections. I also think there is something about keeping the Urine alkaline but Hiprex is now not allowed to be prescribed. I have sometimes used sodium bicarbonate in water . I hope this helps someone and gives hopes that things can change although it does take time. "
"Urinary Tract Infection","Sick of constant kidney infections and antibiotics","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/sick-of-constant-kidney-infections-and-antibiotics-25399","I'm 23 and have had trouble with Kidney infections all my life. When i was little i had trouble with wetting the bed until i was 8years old. All my life i've had infections, some urine but mostly kidney. When i was 20 I developed acute pyloneprhitis which overnight turned into septicaemia and i was rushed into theatre with suspected internal bleeding. I've seen specialists in Dorset, Somerset and Gloucestershire and have had loads of scans and xrays which all confirm there is nothing wrong with my kidneys. The only symptoms i get are pain (always always my left kidney only) and cloudy urine. I seem to get these about once a fortnight - i'm so sick of antibiotics (which dont even work that well anymore) that i've stopped going to doctors and just try to cope with it on my own by drinkingloads of water and taking painkillers. Its been suggested that i take a permanent antibiotic which i take everyday for the rest of my life - but i'm only 23 and i hate taking drugs for anything.I worry that when i'm older i will get kidney failure. I just CANNOT beleive that a normal healthy person can get this many infections and nothing be wrong? Or that there is nothing that can be done about it. The specialist in Gloucestershire told me \""It's very common and unfortunately technology hasnt advanced enough to deal with the disorder, so theres nothing we can do\"".I feel sick, tired and emotional everytime this happens and its so hard to cope with work, university, keeping a house and being a single mum to a 2year old when i feel this ill. I manage but it makes me cry a lot.There must be some explanation or solution???"

So I've only had a bladder infection a couple of times, years apart. I've had a yeast infection once, a couple of month ago. AIt the very start of march (its now 3/8) felt the horrible weirdly itchy-burny esque sensation that I now associate with a yeast infection, so I got an over the counter medocine called AZO to help eith the symptoms while i basically just wait it out. I was like this for weeks, but i started experiencing urgency and frequency to pee, even though I was peeing very little every time i tried. I started drinking a ton of cranberry juice, just as I would as a kid. It helped for a while, but eventually the discomfort and pain was too much to bear. I worked only one day a week for 2 weeks, i was in so much pain.I finally got a ride to the doctors last thursday, was diagnosed with a pretty bad UTI and given 7 days on Bactrim. It worked GREAT and almosy immediately. I am day 6, however (i have not missed a single dose yet) and the symptoms have come back full force. Ive had to pee several times in the last hour and i swear the visits to the toilet are getting more and more frequent, and its starting to hurt dreadfully AGAIN. I am still taking the medicine, why are the symptoms back so suddenly?? Please, its been a month. I cant sleep, im losing my appetite, and my work is suffering immensely. I just want it to be over!"

"Urinary Tract Infection","Chronic low level UTI - no bacteria present","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/chronic-low-level-uti-no-bacteria-present-645661","I wanted to write my story purely in the hope it might help someone who is suffering and looking for answers. I’ve suffered with recurrent UTIs for years but particularly after having children. I kept having infection after infection and my crappy doctor kept prescribing week- long courses of antibiotics and it wasn’t kicking it. It affected me so much to think I was finally better only for it to return with a vengeance. I changed doctors and after 2 longer courses of stronger antibiotics I managed to kick it . But each time I had been to the doctor, dreadfully unwell, all the symptoms of UTI, lower back pain, flu like, fever, palpitations- still no bacteria showed in my urine even when it was sent for tests. You end up feeling like this over emotional, mad woman and it made me super anxious incase they refused me antibiotics. I even at times stock piled antibiotics so I would have them when it struck and not have to keep going to the dr with my ‘non existent’ condition. Eventually I was referred to a urologist who did a cystoscopy (which was horrible + I wouldn’t recommend unless you have to.) He saw no inflammation that would indicate Interstitial Cystitis (but also worth noting I wasn’t having any infection or flares at the time- I also suffer with some bladder flares/ irritation from time to time) but he said my bladder was lying low post childbirth which makes you more susceptible to infections and that he believed I was having a low level, chronic infection and that’s why bacteria wasn’t showing. Recommended 3 month low dose antibiotic next time it reoccurs after the initial course of antibiotics. As I mentioned I do also get some kind of bladder flares and irritation which I would take a prescribed antihistamine at night and also the pill called Azo which I get off amazon, gets rid of symptoms so you can sleep. The antihistamine also helps you to sleep also and got rid of the irritation for me- worth seeing a doctor for if this is what you are suffering with. I was UTI free for a while, took a good probiotic for flora health, and always had D mannose in my cupboard and any time I felt a vague symptom I would take ( many times this works but not always) but I still found very beneficial to have and will never not have some in my cupboard. I recently experienced a reoccurring UTI after 3 rounds of antibiotics it came back again- very upsetting to the point of depression. It makes me so ill and affects me emotionally to the point where I cant face even going to the supermarket, picking my kids up from school, I’m short tempered with them and my husband because I feel like I can’t cope, I really think the illness is chronic and debilitating and if you are suffering and feel emotional/ depressed please know you WILL get through it and you are strong and you will be healthy and happy again, there is ALWAYS light at the end of the tunnel. Take a hot bath, calm yourself and try and stay positive. I think the illness drags you down mentally as well as physically. I honestly even thought I would have to leave my job and started to feel very alone, it makes you realise how health really is wealth. This time I spent 3 days feeling like I was dying because for some reason I thought maybe there really isn’t an infection because nothing ever shows up, maybe this is IC or some kind of flare and I should just ride it out, antibiotics might be making it worse etc etc until eventually one night I broke down and rushed to a walk in clinic where I saw the same dr I had seen for the last course of antibiotics. I told him I felt it had come back he asked me to do a sample. So- earlier that morning, very first thing when I woke up before I had drank any water or fluid, and my urine was - well pretty potent- with the infection and all (sorry TMI). I peed in a pot at home in light of potentially going to the drs. I brought it with me to the emergency drs and switched it into the sample pot. For the first time ever, my urine test was positive for nitrates which showed that my body was battling something, although bacteria didn’t show, it indicated there was definitely a low grade infection. The relief that I feel at finally having validation that my symptoms are REAL is empowering beyond measure, has been a huge relief and weight off my shoulders. I think that, as it is a low grade infection, it’s not showing after I have drank gallons of water etc and then seen a doctor mid day and get asked to do a sample. I really recommend this early morning technique next time it strikes you as I finally got answers rather than another trip with the depressing result of ‘well nothing is showing...’As soon as it showed the low level infection the Dr seemed to have the proof he needed and prescribed 3-6 months low level antibiotic course, as had the urologist (I have previously found despite the urologist advice, drs disapproved of prescribing me because of no bacteria showing so it was always a battle especially to get prescribed a 3 month course.) I am now happily on a low level, long term antibiotic for 6 months which will take me through the summer as this is a triggering time for me. After that if there has been no more infection I will review with the doctor and maybe come off them. I also take a probiotic, don’t drink alcohol, limit my caffeine/ soda intake and try to drink plenty of water, kombucha, rooibus tea + almond milk, vitamin water + I find kefir very calming. I am so happy to finally have a Dr on my side because it no longer looks like I am imagining things or being neurotic. I am so grateful and empowered to have a long term treatment plan. To be on antibiotics long term may not sound ideal but for me it truly is better than the alternative of constant infections. This has been the answer for me and I’m so grateful for modern medicine because my suffering has ended and I’m feeling great. Another thing that I am changing is wearing leggings because I feel very strongly that they contribute to the initial infection for me, I’ve bought some loose, floaty trousers, wear joggers, good quality jeans etc. Sending love to all of you in your journey and pray for health and peace for you "

I get them every couple of months, sometimes a few in between. I actually started antibiotics this morning for another one.The problem is, as far as I know, only one urine sample from these UTI occurrences have shown up with e.coli. The rest seem normal to my doctor, but she agrees that I have a UTI based on my symptoms.I got my first UTI less than a year ago and had no idea what was wrong with me. I was away at the time so I didn't see a doctor + get antibiotics straight away. It was probably 4 days before I saw a doctor.The symptoms I get are:- fatigue, slight fever, malaise- drop in blood pressure when standing or walking- slight pain in the lower abdomen- frequent urinationI have never experienced a burning sensation during urination. I don't always get all of the above symptoms but I always feel generally unwell and dizzy when moving around and those are my main tip offs.I've had an ultrasound on the kidneys, bladder area and everything came up fine. I was hoping they would find a problem because now I'm left with no idea about why I get UTIs so often.My concern is that maybe I'm not getting UTIs and it's some other problem that my doctor can't detect. What questions should I ask my doctor to get down to the bottom of this?"

So I have had a UTI for almost 2 months now. This is the second time I am having one. The first time I had a UTI was about a year ago. The first time I had It, it went away in a day. Back then I had all the symptoms of a normal UTI. Fever with chills, burning sensation while peeling and Bloody urine. But this time, all I had was the severe burning. Like the last time, I was put on a 5 day course of nitrofurantoin and drinking Citralka. But since the burning subsided within a day, I just stopped my course on day 3 and continued drinking Citralka. Life was back to normal for about a week. And then one day I felt a slight burn after I passed urine. At like the very top of my urethra. It wasn't too painful but still pretty noticeable. I didnt want to concluded anything and hence I decided to see if the pain persists when I peed again. The next time I peed not only did it burn but I noticed a toxic odour. The next few times I went it still smelled bad. Sent my urine for culture, the tests revealed that I had e coli and that I was sensitive to Magnex Forte. The doctor recommended that I go on 7 day course of Magnex. Magex is an IV antibiotic. I am on day 6 today and I still feel that slight burn. The only difference is I don't feel the burning while peeling. But I feel it when I sit down or lie down... a weird pressure against the very end of my urethra. I have a feeling that after I stop my course of antibiotics my UTI will come back again. Is there any out of this hell?P.S: I am not very sexually active. Although the UTI I am currently experiencing did follow after sex, i have sex like once in 3 months. I have had sex before (with condoms on each time) but never had an UTI. After this whole UTI thing I have never had sex."

I had 4 courses of antibiotics and then got sent for an ultrasound which all came back clear, another doctor then gave me another course of antibiotics which still didn’t clear it and I’ve now been referred to a Urologist (appt next week). A urine sample has been sent off to the doctors every 2/3 weeks since July and hasn’t come back clear once. The doctor thinks that the urologist will most likely want to do a Cytoscopy. Since all this started I haven’t felt majorly ill, I just very occasionally get the pain to the right of my belly button, but not bad enough to stop me doing anything, and have had a few occasions where it’s burnt a bit when I’ve urinated. I’m only aware the infection is still there as my urine is so much darker than it has ever been. The day I got my referral from the doctors she tested a urine sample whilst I was there which also showed traces of blood in my urine. I’ve also been experiencing extreme fatigue and rapid weight gain over the last few years (not sure if these symptoms could be related?). I just wondered if anyone had any idea what could be causing this? A bit about me to help: I’ve got ‘borderline’ under active thyroid and currently on 50mcg a day, was also treated last year for low B12. I’m 22 years old, I have horses so lead an active lifestyle and eat healthily. I don’t drink or smoke. "

I assume it needs confirmation before taking any treatment.- never had a discharge- no urge to pee- pain in groin area, lymph nodes not swollen, used to feel burning sensation- sensitive skin, seems like nerve irritation, mostly in groin area, but sometimes all body gets irritated- random pelvic pains, left and right side- random tingling penis tip and tingling/itching anus- something uncomfortable inside urethra, dark red (bluish) spots visible inside urethra- hsv1 positive, cmv positive. Never had a lesion.- had some fever symptoms, fatigue, sore throat and chills.

"Urinary Tract Infection","UTI for 6 months??! HELP","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/uti-for-6-months-help-609650","So just to set the scene of what i'm going through, about six months ago i became sexually active. The day of actually losing my virginity I noticed a burning sensation during peeing on the day after (i didn't know you had to pee after). i didn't think much of it but further research made it clear that it is a big deal and should get cleared up by antibiotics. Since then i've been getting so many different symptoms in variations of recurring infections.To describe my symptoms:- burning sensation - frequently urinating - dark colour urine sometimes - foul smell urine - pain during sex- feeling sick - shivers sometimes To be honest the symptoms vary quite considerably. For example my previous UTI had a horrid smell but i don't have that with the one current. My doctor keeps giving me macrobids antibiotics, and don't get me wrong, they do help, but in about 3 weeks later my UTI comes back. My doctor told me that no infection came up in my urine and she now wants me to do a STI test to rule it out. I should mention to that every time i get cured by the antibiotics, me and my boyfriend start getting sexually active again... but surprise surprise the UTI returns. there's not really a pattern, last month we had sex 3 times and one the 4th it came back. I make sure I pee and shower and everything but i can just feel when it's coming. Dmannose doesn't help either, nothing does.. not even cranberry supplements. I've just got to drink as much water as possible. If i get a little dehydrated, then it's 2 hours curled up in a ball as the pain comes in waves, even if i do or don't pee.. the pain will always follow. I can't drink any sort of fizzy or caffeinated drink or the pain gets worse too. I feel like having a possible STI is my only bet but my boyfriend is highly confident that he doesn't have one. It's really upsetting me, i genuinely feel sorry for myself because i love my boyfriend to bits and i'm starting to refuse sex out of fear of the pain. This will obviously affect our relationship. I just hate it, especially @ the people that said sex would be great... i'd give anything to go back to my healthy self lol. I'm just desperate if anyone has any answers / advice. Thanks."
"Urinary Tract Infection","Helpful Tips for UTI's","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/helpful-tips-for-uti-s-624823","I've been suffering from these for years and tried a million different things. One thing I have learnt for sure is that doctors (GP's and Specialists/Urologists) don't seem to know what they are doing when it comes to UTI's. So we are on our own for now.I have found some things that have helped me, and it depends on why your body is out of balance so these may or may not work in helping to balance you:- Antibiotics seldom work for UTI's and put your body into a very unhealthy state where you keep getting them - bad cycle- Raw garlic 3 x a day (1 tsp or 1 whole clove) can work as well as some antibiotics (just be prepared to smell like garlic- D-Mannose does nothing for me, so I wouldn't bother- Eat paleo (cut out grains, dairy, sugar. Don't eat s****y cheap processed meats/food). Salad, homemade dressing if any, eggs, lean meat etc.- Oregano oil - few drops in water- Stacey Butterfield - a Naturopath in QLD, Australia, helped me a LOT. She does skype consults from anywhere.- Advil- Potassium citrate or sodium citrate, usually a liquid at pharmacies.- PROBIOTICS 4 per day!!! and depending on how many antibiotics you've taken (I've been taking them a lot for 7 years), then you need to take probiotics for one month for each year of usae = 7 months for me. I use the clinicians brand called flora restore, for female gential health. Take one with water in the morning, and put one in vaginally - then do again before bed. This is really important - time to distance yourself from horrible antibiotics and save them for when you need life-saving surgery!- Avoid SUGAR, coffee and alcohol - If sexually active have a solid hygiene routine for before and after, and maybe use a natural lubricant like coconut oil to minimise bladder trauma.Hopefully this helps someone fix their UTI Natural and healthy is the only long term solution, it takes time and hard work!

After I woke up, when I went to urinate, I noticed strong smell from my urine but the urine was clear though. Took 1 antibiotic tablet for my other medical condition (not related to UTI). Went back to urinate again in another 30 mins, this time the urine was milky white. Googled it and found out might be UTI. Been freaked out ever since. So, i drank lots of water just to check on my urine again, this time the urine color was quite clear. Did it 3 times (Drink & urinate). Clear colored urine all the 3 times and no pain while urinating. Can someone please reply on the questions below:1) I drank couple of beers last night and had very less water so guessing my body was quite dehydrated. Can dehydration cause milky urine?2) Could it be the antibiotic tablet (not related to UTI) that I took in between which caused the milky white urine?3) Incase a person has contracted UTI, is the urine always milky all the time?4) What's the dead sure give away symptom for UTI?Appreciate all your kind responses.

"Urinary Tract Infection","Is this a UTI? Or did it go away?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/is-this-a-uti-or-did-it-go-away--621296","I'm a 20 year old female, and I'm debating getting checked out by my doctor or waiting it out a little longer. About 6 days ago I had a frequent urge to go pee and many times not much would come out, and along with the frequent urge my pee was also cloudy but not smelly. Then a little while later I started to get the pain with the peeing, not really a burning or stinging sensation but it just hurt internally right around the bottom of my bladder. That pain lasted a couple days with also a kind of sharper pain in my lower back on the right side. But that pain also went away after a day and I was only left with foggy pee and still a little urge to urinate. Then just a couple days ago I peed and when I wiped there was a little tint of pink which I assume would be an indication of blood in the urine. I'm on the birth control shot and it stops my period, so I know it is likely not mensruation blood. But the actual pee in the bowl was still yellow and it only happened that once. Now I have no pain when i urinate, no foggy pee, no blood, no lower back pain, I only have an achy cramp-like pain in my lower left abdomen. It's like all the symptoms of UTI went away and I'm left with some pressure in my left side. I notice it more when I breathe in hard cause then it hurts a little bit. So I'm not sure if I should just let it go a little longer and see if it goes away or if I should go get tested just in case so there's no possibility of it getting worse. Some additional info:About a little over a month ago I had a bad cold and had frequent urges to go to the bathroom because I was having diarrhea. And it came with extreme abdominal pain and I would have to sit there and shake my leg until the pain went away, the pain would tend to pass after I went poop or passed gas. I lost a bunch of weight also. It all went away after a couple of weeks and I was back to normal. I never went to the doc then either, so that's partly why I'm debating sticking out this pain too. Also a few days ago I was checking with a mirror to see if all was good that I could physically see, and I noticed that my vaginal mucus was a milky white color which seemed a little odd to me. I had a really tough yeast infection back in August, I believe it was, so it just made me think of that also. But the vaginal mucus isn't like the cottage cheese texture and isn't smelly, it was just milky which got me thinking that that's why my pee was cloudy and not a UTI. I haven't noticed anymore of the milky white discharge since then either.I am also sexually active but havent had sex in over a week. And I also eat very good, meats, fruit, vegetables, carbs, been drinking lots of water, lots of milk, orange juice, etc.So I don't know what to do now. I'm a little puzzled, and don't know if I should see if my body will take care of the pain and everything will go away, or if I should tell this all to my doc and have him run some tests on my pee or check for yeast infections or anything. Or if it's something else all together too, I really don't know. I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read and respond to this, thanks!"

Unfortunately for me, they are caused by the wonderful act of sexual intercourse! Now, most of you will be wanting to ask the usual questions and give me the usual advice of ""make sure you wash before and after"", ""do you ensure you empty your bladder afterwards?"", ""Do you drink cranberry juice"" and the list goes on and on.The answers to all of the questions are YES, I have tried EVERYTHING and I am getting to the point of giving up. It's beginning to affect my life in so many ways and I'm sure many of you feel the same way? (I can't be alone on this one) I have tried all sorts, I have used cranberry tablets, I keep myself hydrated, I wear cotton underwear, I have used a prophylactic, I am now resistant to trimethoprim and nitrofurantoin is beginning to go that way as well. Earlier this year I had a cystoctopy where they stretched my urethra and my bladder, but to no avail, I have had 3 infections since then. I am careful when having sex, I'm sure many of you know you have to avoid rough sex and ensure you are well lubricated. I wash before and after sex and ensure I empty my bladder straight after the 'deed' is done. I've recently discovered Waterful D-Mannose, which is the first thing in 12 years that helps relieve the debilitating pain naturally. When I have a UTI I have to take 60mg of codeine, 400mg of ibuprofen and 1000mg of paracetamol. It's affecting my job, therefore affecting my wages and we all have bills to pay right? I'm reaching out to see if anyone else is going through what I'm going through and to see what other advice people who actually suffer with UTI's can offer me.. I look forward to hearing from my fellow sufferers 🙌??Leonie."

But my nemesis, the UTI is standing in our way. I'm now so afraid to have sex these days because there's always a UTI to follow as punishment! For the last year and a half, they have become more & more frequent with me, and I've had them almost once a month for the past several months. (I must've had atleast over 10 last year.) and they turn me into a miserable, grumpy and emotional wreck. The last one I had lasted for two weeks! I had to take 3 rounds of cephalexin (or Keflex as docs call it) to rid it entirely, which is more than I've ever needed. I've been on Keflex many times and it's always helped, but it's taking longer & longer to work.The UTI's always come back.I've searched in vain and done all the little routine things you do to prevent them (wipe front to back, keep clean down there, pee after sex etc) u name it!I've also been on Hiprex for about a year to help with it all. I have started taking strong Cranberry tablets and probiotics to try and keep the bacteria at bay. But it doesn't really seem to be working all that much.I've had numerous urine and blood samples taken, and e-coli always seems to be the cause, plus there's always heaps of leukocytes present.I have an appt with a urologist coming up, but it's far off as he's in high demand, so for now it's just a waiting game.I've done so much research and discovered that D-mannose has helped a lot of people in preventing or reducing UTI's. So I jumped online and ordered two batches of capsules to see if it works for me, no harm in trying I suppose, I'll just about try anything. (It took two weeks to get here as they don't seem to have it in Australia sadly,)The reviews are good (apart from a few bad ones) but I want to know if anybody here has had some success stories with it. Also there don't seem to be any clear guidelines on how much to take.I hope to god it helps...

I got prescribed antibiotics and they cleared it up fine. I'm had Trimethoprim for most of my Uti's except one. They all seemed to get rid of it every time but I recently got one two weeks ago and went to the doctors the next day after getting it as it was late Saturday evening & was prescriped Trimethoprim again. 2 tablets for 3 days. It made the pain go down but now after finishing them and waiting a few days to see if the last bit of pain will go, I feel like I'm about to get a full on Uti again, and I'm so scared because the pain is so horrible, I cry myself to sleep and literally can't take it. It's horrible. I can't do anything in my day to day life, and I'm being kicked out of sixth form because I'm always off school because of this pain & I just can't take it anymore. I've had it 7 times and I keep getting given antibiotics and I've sent off urine samples twice because the other times I literally just could not produce a sample and each time they haven't even contacted me back with results. The last Uti I had they haven't given me results back. I don't know what to do. I'm petrified of the hospital so going there just doesn't look like an option for me unless I get dragged there, but I'm thinking it's my only option but just all the tests scare me. I just want to be normal. I thought I had found the cause as I only got Uti's when I became sexually active and I thought it was condoms as everytime we used them the next day I would get a Uti. If we didn't use them, I wouldn't get a Uti.

"Urinary Tract Infection","Now a patient...","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/now-a-patient--606448","Hi everyone. Just joined and wanted to intro myself. I actually retired from a career as a military physician (family med) last year and started teaching. Mostly staying home to take care of a family medical issue.I've had chronic recurring UTIs since I was in my early 20s.... maybe 15 since then (Im a 42 yo female in the US... couldn't find an American support group this big). This year, gotten especially bad, with one after another, mostly treated with Macrobid/Nitrofurantin, always E coli. I saw a specialist in my 20s, who did the full workup, including cystoscopy, flow studies, contrast imaging, etc. Found nothing unusual anatomically back then. Now with my recurring UTIs getting worse, I'm set to see another urologist tomorrow. Very frustrating having lots of book knowledge (and seeing similar in patients in the past) but not being able to help myself. I've found that sometimes patients are more familiar with some diseases than some doctors, just from personal experience. But it is frustrating because as scientists, we are trained not to put too much weight on anecdotal evidence (often for good reason). A good example of this is D-mannose. There is a ton of accumulating evidence that it works well, few side effects, yet many of my colleagues don't even know about it. I have only recently come across it myself and bought a bottle this morning. There is good science behind it and I wish I had discovered it sooner. I'm at the point where I am getting desperate for any leads on other preventative measures. Has anyone tried Goldenseal? Any other ideas beyond the common tips (hygiene, peeing with sex, hydration, vitamin C/cranberry, etc)?"

After another week, I went back because I still had pain while I went. It wasn't as bad as it had been prior but the burning sensation and the irritation was still there. Even after urination, the pain would remain there and it would just feel all around uncomfortable and still does. So, the doctor did a test for STDs which to no surprise was negative which left me in pain and with no answers. Now, on the third doctor (I moved and so had to go to a third one), and she had me checked for a yeast infection which I did not have but she did say I was extremely irritated down there on the outside of my vagina and so she prescribed me this cream called Nystatin which has done nothing for me. She also did another diptest which came back negative for bacteria in my urine. She stated that it was ""absolutely beautiful."" Yet, I still have a burning sensation while I pee and sometimes it hurts to push the pee out. I took AZO a couple of hours ago and that seemed to only make things worse. I guess I'm just wondering if urethritis could have been triggered by my UTI and is still there even if the bacteria isn't? Or if it's possible to have a UTI without a positive bacteria test? I know urethritis is generally caused by an infection so I don't know if my urethra could still be inflamed from this UTI that I had a month ago.

"Urinary Tract Infection","I have had so many uti's this past year, I'm starting to go crazy!","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/i-have-had-so-many-uti-s-this-past-year-i-m-starting-to-go-crazy--594316","Okay so first off, I started having my first UTI since I started being sexual active which was when I was 18. I'm 22 now & ive noticed it has just gotten worse, especially this last year! I've had multiple UTI's in one month sometimes and I'm assuming that's due to the the antibiotics not working & the baceteria is either immune to the antibiotic or they're not prescribing me the correct antibiotic. Last year I was prescribed an antibiotic for a bad uti I had, I was on that for one week , after that I still had my uti symptoms and I was prescribed another antibiotic and I was on that for another two weeks. Even after that I still experienced symptoms i wasn't fully comfortable & keep in mind at a daily basis I control my uti symptoms by taking D mannose 3 times a day & cranberry pills daily. After 9 months having minor uti symptoms i got a yeast infection so I went back because I didn't feel & my doctor told me this whole time I had a bladder infection & a yeast infection. But it didn't make sense to me because I thought uti's and bladder infection were the same thing. After that round of antibiotics I felt better but he referred to a urologist to get a specialists opinion. I went to the urologist & they put a camera up my urethra to check my bladder lining (ouch)! & she told me that my bladder lining is looking great , but what she told me before doing so is , if my muscles spasm as she inserts the camera into my urethra then she might expect my pelvic floor muscles to have tighten from a bad infection & they've never learn to relax themselves. I've never heard of the PFM & I was confused & slightly relieved but she told me to learn how to relax my muscles & use heating pads & make sure I relax myself a good amount before sex. & if the pain persists to go to a physical therapist for PFM.i didn't go to the physical therapist yet because I wanted to try to fix it myself & I noticed the pain kinda went away. I would take deep breaths and remind myself that I didn't have a uti and it was my muscles. & I think mentally it helped knowing I didn't have a UTI so that was Something. Unfortunately I still get UTI's and they would come all of a sudden which were the worse ones to cure! & so far now that I'm thinking is , they're usually a day after I have had sex which freaks me out because I can't enjoy anything & I follow all the uti prevention guidelines -peeing after sex-washing myself before sex-I make sure my partner is clean as well-i wash myself every time I have a bowel movement-I drink plenty of water to where I feel like I don't even need to flush the toilet no more! It's so clear -I avoid spicy food & all things sugary (when I have my uti symptoms) I suppose I could take spicey & sugary foods all out of my diet & see if that works but honestly I can't think of a time a had a uti by only my diet ? Every time I have a uti I've had sex the day of or the day before. & im thinking of not having sex anymore. Cause it's such a hassle I'm going insanse & I can't enjoy the simple things in life. I had my first Pap smear today & hours after I got a horrible UTI , I did have sex the day before so I just can't determine what's going on. The thing is I don't want to take an antibiotics all the time because reading all these UTI stories I don't want to become immune to them. And what happens if I do become immune to these antibiotics. The pain is so bad I can't do anything & I don't know what to do & also I'm not on birth control so it doesn't have to do with that. I'm just thinking to try the antibiotic before sex or just stop it completely cause I feel like there's no hope..I'm going to try the physical therapy & stop having sex for a while but what if I can't ever have sex again . It's a nightmare "

I had a hysterectomy, removal of my ovaries, tubes and adjacent lymph nodes in July 2016 due to endometrial cancer diagnosis. I have been recovering well, but in mid December 2016 started to urinate more frequently. I experienced no pain or blood in urine until mid January, 2017. (I've had UTI's before, and always got pain with them.) I was exhasted and felt very unwell, but didn't associate how I felt with a UTI, until I saw the blood. For that infection (the bacteria was cultured) I was prescribed macrobid 100 mg, twice a day for 7 days. The infection cleared up in a week.Unfortunately, I began to urinate frequently and feel unwell on May 4. My urine was tested, and cultured again. My doctor again put me on macrobid, and I've been on it for 7 days. I took the last pill this morning. This time on the drug, I've felt more side effects and unwell while taking the macrobid than before.Today I got a call from the office and was informed that a prescription for 250 mg of ciprofaxin was going to be called in for me, in case my UTI symptoms returned. I am concerned about cipro, but I can't take penicillin or bactrim. The nurse and I agreed that if my symptoms came back I would start taking the cipro and let them know.Since the previous UTI, I've made sure to take cranberry capsules and probiotics daily, including the cultures lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and lactobacillus furmentum (sp?) RC-14. Won't taking macrobid and cipro so close together wipe out all my beneficial bacteria?Any advice/information will be much appreciated! "

I was wondering if many of us whose infections don't go away has this particular E. coli that is taken hold of our bodies. If any of you ladies have ever heard of this please share your thoughts. And how do we get it checked. Any information shared would do good to so many of us who are suffering from this painful affliction."

"Urinary Tract Infection","Reoccurring UTI","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/reoccurring-uti-592776","Hello, hopefully someobdy can help me with this as I am very concerned for my 82 year old Dad. Normally very fit and healthy without taking any medications in his life apart from the odd paracetamol now and then. My dad started with what the doctor belived what a water infection. He was very unwell for a few days, shivering, temperature and just generally unwell. He thought he had the flu and so we called the doctor out for him as he was very very weak. The doctor came and examined him and found he had blood on his penis, he was very quick to diagnose a water infection and prescibed 7 day course of antibiotics. My dad seemed to be getting better and was no longer shivering and no temp. 2 days after his last antibiotics and it has started again. Shivering, temp and he looks so old and frail, just not like my dad. Throughout all of this I must add he has kept eating and drinking loads so we are happy with this. Another trip to the doctors and they have given him another course of antibiotics and told him water infection again. My question is, can this be right? another water infection? and can this make you very ill. Shivering, hot and cold and this has gone on for 2 1/2 weeks. I know we will have to wait and see the outcome in a few days but I am extremely worried about him.Thank you for reading this and any advice would be helpful."

I have tried everything from altering diet (dairy free, lactose free) increasing water intake, empty the bladder before and after sex, tried condoms, natural lubricants, cotton underwear, showering twice a day, to taking a daily low dose of Macrobid for six months, which in fact destroyed my good gutt bacteria. This in turn cause all kinds of other issues such as candida (yeast overgrowth), although the uti's were at bay during that time, the long term effects to my digestive system that I was oblivious to outweighted the short term relief.You become desperate that if they said stand on your head before and after sex to prevent a Uti, sadly I may have tried that. I am 46 and perimeno but still have a montly period. As perscribed by Urologist I have tried a low dose of etrogen cream once a week as well. I have seen Urologists, Gyno, Infection Control and noone can find any irregularities to cause this yet urine sample prove I am cronic. This in turn has caused alot of anxiety and strains on a marriage for obvious reasons. I am thankful however I do have a supportive partner. Has anyone tried a 50 billion strength with 15 stains or more probiotic daily and received any benefits from Uti's? If so, which have you tried and how long did it take before you saw results. I have also tried cranberry suppliments and d- mannose powder and tablets with no luck. They say your gutt should be 80/20 with 80 per cent good bacteria so I do belief Uti's are also associated with bad gutt issues. Appreciate any and all feedback other then daily antibiotics as a means of treatment.I would rather prevent and get to the root of the problem before treatment is required.

"Urinary Tract Infection","Chronic UTIs (5 years ago) ","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/chronic-utis-5-years-ago--483131","Hello! I am 28 years old. I got my first UTI when I was pregnant back in 2010. Since then, I have been on several antibiotics over the past 5 years for chronic UTIs. Every antibiotic that you could possibly think of NO longer works. Every urine culture grows E.Coli as the main bacteria! Since March 2015, I have been taking Keflex 500mg bid for suppressive therapy. Along with taking this, I am still getting breakthrough UTIs. Since August 2015, I have received Rocephin 1g injection every month because I am still getting a UTI. What scares me is to know that I have been on Cipro, Bactrim, Levaquin, Marcobid, etc (you name it) and they all have built resistance toward the bacteria, E.Coli. What happens when Keflex does that? and each antibiotic after that? How am I still getting breakthrough UTIs? I am not sexually active, I don't drink much caffeine (other than coffee), I wipe front to back. I have seen 4 urologist thus far because I feel they all seem to think suppressive therapy is the only option for me, but can't give me a legit reason as to why all this occurred when I got pregnant and why I am still suffering with it? I get told the same information each time! Same test, procedures, X-rays. It has become overwhelming because what happens when ALL the antibiotics stop working? What are my options then? Does anyone have any suggestions? Thanks so much! "

"Urinary Tract Infection","Help for 4 month antibiotic resistant UTI ","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/help-for-4-month-antibiotic-resistant-uti-502336","After several doctor appts, tests, 2 cystoscopy's, urologists, urogynecologist, urology physican ass't and most recently a nurse practioner that specializes in Institial Cystits...I have self diagnosed myself that I apparently have an antibiotic resistant UTI. I am a 60 year 'young' female and never had a UTI before in my life! Or if I did, it went away after a day of frequency. One day in November I woke up with frequency, which progressed to another symptom of horrible 'urge' to urinate that lasted up until a few weeks ago. (no urgency, just icky urge feeling all day - except I could sleep at night thankfully!). Some urethra burning over the months but never when I urinated. Was diagnosed with - vaginal atrophy (which is correct), urethritis, overactive bladder- but no meds ever worked. Interstitial cystisis was ruled out becuase of no pain and no urgency - rushing to bathroom - and test results. Had a few doses of antibiotic when UTI tested (only 4 times tested in Docs office - 3 times positive 1 time negative) ...felt like things were better then burning, frequency would come back. I just got off of 15 days of antibiotics (macrobid) last week and today I did a home test and it showed positive for a UTI. So it never has ever really gone fully away. Today frequency is better, no burning, but I still have an irritation in urethra that just feels like an infection - and is. I ordered D Mannose powder and am going to try that every hour for a couple days. Suppose I should try cranberry sugar free juice, but I read that it really doesn't help everyone. Has anyone else found something that worked to finally get rid of a UtI? So frustrated...just want to feel normal again 'down there' again...thanks for any advice or suggestions!"

"Urinary Tract Infection","Antibiotic provides no relief for UTI, and neither does anything else we try","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/antibiotic-provides-no-relief-for-uti-and-neither-does-anything-else-we-try-561617","My wife started with some medical symptoms monday of this last week. I believe the primary being abdominal discomfort at the time. Halfway through her work day she had to ask to go home she was in such pain. She rested until i got off of work. She said she didnt think she could work like that tomorrow so she wanted to go get a doctors note. As an aside, she had gallbladder attacks a while back and subsequently had her gallbladder taken out in november. The pain she was having seemed similar to her gallbladder pain, under the right rib cage and radiating to the back. Heat helps. We went to an urgent care as it was too late in the day to get in at a regular doctors office. We explained the symptoms and the gallbladder removal to the doctor and he pushed on her a bit then left to let the nurse collect some blood and urine. He came back and said he didn't find anything, might just be heart burn, wrote a script for antacid and said to call our regular doctor if symptoms persist. Before he could shoo us out i asked for a doctors note and he looked at me like i was crazy but went and wrote a doctors note for one day. The way my wife's work handles absences is you lose points for absence, going home early or tardiness, and before your first 90 days with the company the points bank is pretty slim. If you get a doctors note they will forgive any subsequent absence covered by the note but the points taken by calling in sick or going home early are still gone. After the urgent care we went to the almost closed pharmacy and got her antacid prescription filled, picked up food, ate and went to bed. This was already well past our normal bed time and i couldnt sleep right away. Then she started tossing and turning in her sleep, which kept me from sleeping much until the reason for the tossing and turning became apparent. She woke up in tremendous pain and asked me to help her to the bathroom. She couldn't stand up straight and after she urinated she sat down and rested her head on the toilet seat thinking she was about to throw up. She was sweaty and clammy. After we made it back to the bedroom she asked me to take her to the ER so i got some things packed and got her dressed and we headed off. The time she woke up was about 3:15am, and the urgent care visit was about 7pm the previous day. About 8 hours of time difference. The ER was desolate, 1 person in the waiting room. Somehow it still took forever to be seen. At least 45 minutes. Meanwhile she rated her pain as an 8 out of 10, worse than anything she experienced from the gallbladder issues. After we got in, and got to talk to a doctor we explained how the pain resembled gallbladder pain and so the doctor ordered an ultrasound to look for stones in her bile duct that may have been left behind during surgery, and apparently they looked at other internal organs while doing it too. Eventually the ER doctor came back and said no stones, but she did have a pretty bad UTI. My wife's mother texted and said to request a shot of rocefin so we did and the doctor obliged, and wrote us a prescription for cipro 500mg(twice daily)and promethazine. They put the rocefin in her IV but then hurried us out before the bag was even fully empty. The pain in the ER had warranted morphine injections but somehow they didnt even release us with a day or two worth of pain medicine. When asked the discharging nurse said to alternate tylenol and ibuprofen. They also didnt give us a doctors note in the release packet of papers. When going to the same ER for her gallbladder attacks prior to the surgery we were discharged with pain meds and a doctors note for multiple days without even asking. She wasnt even employed then. After leaving in what was now the late morning, we went home, and after i got her settled i took the prescriptions and dropped them off at the pharmacy(ER wont call them in to save you time) then later went back and picked them up. She didnt want to be away from me so she went with me to pick them up and we had to stop at the store to pick up some things. She was in such rough shape that I had to push her around the store on a cart because she was walking like a little old lady and we would have been there all night. by the time we got home and she got her first does of oral antibiotic in it was into the evening already. Had the urgent care center caught this she could have started antibiotics 24 hours sooner and maybe wouldve had better results. That is my first of many bones to pick. Somehow she went from nothing to ""really bad uti"" in 8 hours, and the urgent care doctor seemed very hurried and dismissive. Between the two doctors so far wed probably talked to a doctor for 10 minutes combined. The ER doctor didnt stop to say if they cultured the infection, what part of her urinary tract was infected, or explain what she meant by ""really bad"". I should pause here and say that were pretty sure where the UTI came from and its probably my fault and makes me feel like a monster. It was freakishly warm for january this last weekend so we went backpacking and i forgot to pack any wipes, so both of us ended up using leaves to clean up and also there was some tent bound coitus that took place. Im sure something in that scenario led to this and its my fault. I should also mention she has none of the classic uti symptoms. No urgency to pee or frequent urination, no burning when she pees. Wednesday rolled around and she could barely get up but none the less soldiered on. I gave her 8 hour slow release tylenol arthritis, 1300mg. It helped a little for maybe 2 hours. She went to work but by 3/4 of the way through the day she had to request to go home. After i got off of work i went to the pharmacy and bought AVO maximum strength and AVO urinary tract defense which have different active ingredients and the later actually claims to have an anti-bacterial agent in it. I also got some cranberry urinary tract health captlets that have concentrated cranberry, probiotics, vitamin c, and calcium. I drove to the ER and asked for a doctors note. The charge nurse reviewed her previous visit and wrote her a doctors note....for the previous day(tuesday) which is no help at all... I asked nicely if they could write a longer doctors note and was told no. I went home and started her cycling the over the counter stuff and she had already been increasing her water intake. When morning rolled around she reluctantly got up and soldiered on once again. She works in a factory btw so its not an easy job even when youre at 100%. She called her gynecologist who she has known for years to explain the situstion and ask if she could get a doctors note. She also said no. She kept texting me on her breaks that the tylenol and avo were useless. We had tried including ibuprofen in the mix but she couldnt tell that even 600mg made a difference and you have to eat before taking ibuprofen and sometimes she was too nauseous to eat. She asked me to come meet her for lunch so i left my office for lunch, picked up some food and met her for lunch. She wasnt interested in food and just sat and cried. The only reason she stayed is the limited points situation and that day they had a safety meeting in the after noon which she could sit for. After i got off of work i called a urologist and begged for an emergency visit so they scheduled us for the following afternoon. Friday morning she went to work but halfway thriugh the day she had to call it quits. She is now out of points and will be fired if she leaves early, shows up 1 minute late, or calls in sick, 1 more time in the next 35 days. We went to the urologist appointment, who had pulled her records and she tried to piece things together from what we told her and what she could see in the files. I asked and she confirmed that the ER did do a culture and the cipro should be effective, but still didnt tell me what the culture found. Apparently the ultra sound had showed no signs of any swelling in internal organs that might indicate some specific conditions. I think there was some blood in her urine so they ordered an xrsy of her abdomen to look for kidney stones. This came back negative but the urologist noted that her bowels looked to be filled up with gas and asked when she last pooped, which was sunday. She said this could be worsening the UTI symptoms and recommended miralax or warm prune juice. She then ordered another shot of rocefin(1 gram) and switched her from the cipro to generic bactrim DS 800mg-160mg even though she said the cipro should work for that infection. She ordered another culture and scheduled a followup visit. The urologist was by far the most attentive doctor weve seen this week and spent the most time with us but when asked for a doctors note we were once again left hanging. She said they couldnt write a doctors note for longer than 3 days, which wint help with the points loss from friday and she doesnt work saturday or sunday, so useless. I dont understand this, in the usa a doctors note is just a piece of paper, they arent a legally binding contract, they aren't a controlled substance, you cant use them exclusively to claim disability benefits, the employer isnt going to sue, there is nothing really to come back on the doctor and this is reflected in my own personal experience and that of others ive known where doctors are usually very giving with doctors notes. I dont understand this stinginess and watching my wife all hunched over and waddling into work is making me rather angry. It is now saturday, the miralax and prune juice havent done their job yet, she has been on antibiotics for 5 days, oral and 2 doses of injected rocefin(one IV and the other in the hip) with zero improvement in her symptoms, she is still in so much pain its difficult to sleep or lay down, working is agony. She has also been on her period and fighting a mild head cold this whole time. This morning she woke up in agony at 5am, groaning and rolling around trying to get comfortable and i gave her another dose of antibiocs(per the twice daily schedule) tylenol and a promethazine which knocked her out for a while so she could actually get some rest but she cant take something that makes her drowsy while working in a factory. From what i understand most UTIs dont result in this kind of pain and the worst symptom after starting antibiotics is usually urgency to urinate which she doesnt even have, shes only peeing more because she is drinking more as instructed. I dont understand what is happening, has it moved into her kidneys and for some reason the doctors arent taking it as seriously as they should? Is something else going on here? Im sick now which is making it harder to take care of her, as a cherry on top, someone slammed their car door into my car at the urologist's office and drove off while we were being seen. I feel like im at my wits end, all i can do is sit and watch her suffer and if she doesnt go to work monday she will lose her job and her insurance. "

I am a 20 year olde female and for the past 2-3 years I have had recurrent utis. To start with it was once every few weeks, then once a week then they started happening every second day which as you can immagine is unbearable. I swear I have had so many samples taken, tests done and seen so many specailists I am slowly giving up.When I get a uti it's not one that can be treated with a healthy life style and plenty water, I genuinly do not pass anything but blood, there is no urine and when I do go (which is like every two seconds there's hardly anything to pass) even though I'm drinking LOTS OF WATER. I sweat, feel sick, get dizzy and I genuinly can't leave the toilet. This is honestly ruining my life. I'm currently sitting in bed crying when I should be out with all my friends having fun. I have had the same partner for 2 years and we have both been tested for STI'S- every one you could imagine. I have tried everything, from herbal remedies, to cranberry vitamins and juice, washing before and after sex(my partner too), peeing before and after sex, drinking LOTS of water, eating healthy, not drinking alcohol for a while, cutting out chocolate, citrus fruits etc and NOTHING IS WORKING. I know there are so many posts similar to mine but I honestly can not describe how low this is making me feel- I'm just hoping by reading my past there may be a different answer from what I've already read on other blogs.My doctor has had me on so many antibiotics its become a joke. I've had three day courses, weekly courses and I was even put on one antibiotic a night for 6 months- changing the antibiotic so I didn't become immune. However NOTHING has worked... Despite efforts I have became immune to some antibitocs and I don't want to keep putting these pills in my body.I had a car accident three years ago where I underwent major surgery- I had a perforated bowel which meant I had to be cut open, flushed out and stitched back up- the doctors all know this however no one has seemed to link it.. I've asked could they have accidently caught something when operating but no one seems to think so.. although the utis started after the operation?I seen a specialist who performed an operation to widen the tubes of my bladder- urethral dilation I think it's called.. I am not going to lie for 6 months I had NO urine infections it was the best thing ever but recently I had started getting one every week again and if you have never had one I can't describe the pain this is causing me. Not only is it sore but I genuinly feel so low, I can't do anything like normal people my age. I know there are so much worse things that I could have but to me this is ruining my life.CAN SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME???I have tried everything Please do not come back with lots of water, and all the things I've already tried I'm just looking for another option the doctors maybe haven't mentioned?Thanks in advance x"

I would say that when I urinate, it does not hurt, burn or anything. Just a normal stream and that's it. I went to the GP and had my urine and blood sample taken for tests in which both came out negative. I also had ultrasound scan on my bladder and the doctor said it was normal. So I was just given Cipro for 5 days and I was on my way. However, on the second day of taking Cipro, I noticed some joint pain which is a known problem of Cipro. I was then switched to Trimethoprim for 7 days. So far, I have just finished taking the course and I would not say I have frequent urination (7-8 times a day).

In certain positions I do feel pain but not to the point where I need him to stop. In the past I never had UTIs after sex or ever so I'm wondering if this could be it???"

Then on Sunday I could tell that I was getting one for real. I was determined to try to find it myself and came across some articles about d-mannose.

My bladder is feeling better it does not burn when I go potty but I'm having an aching in my lower back. In the past when I had bladder infections I've had achiness in my back ut I don't feel sick at all and I only feel the achiness in my back when I bend down to pick something up. Should I keep doing what I'm doing or is it time to go to the doctor I just don't want this to get out of hand but I really want to give this d- mannose a try. Is there anything else I could be doing I'm drinking a ton of water and taking vitamin C if there's anything else I can do I would love the advice.

I didn't feel unwell physically though.The Saturday morning I took myself off to my local hospital minor injuries unit for antibiotics. I was given a 5 day course of trimethoprim 200mg. I had diarrhoea twice Saturday morning. Saturday afternoon the fever kicked in but not too serious. My worst day was Sunday. Severe back pain on both flanks and at the bottom of my back. Sunday night I woke in a raging sweat. Soaking wet through but not feeling ill. Monday I thought I was well on the way to recovery. No back pain until I got up that is! No signs of feeling unwell except feeling a little lathargic. Monday evening a yet again had diarrhoea twice and my lower back pain was terrible when I got up. Monday night I again woke in a terrible sweat. The thing is I don't feel unwell. Going to the toilet is getting easier but Tuesday is day 4 of 5 and it should have cleared up by now. Do I need to panic and go back to my doctors or ride it out and hope the last 4 pills do the job? I'm very concerned that my kidneys are getting damaged which will lead to further complications. Any help??"

"Urinary Tract Infection","No more UTI's!!","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/no-more-uti-s--538858","I used to get a UTI every few weeks and with a few changes I made, I no longer get them! I understand how painful and annoying they can be so if anyone wants to read, here are the very simple changes I made to stop the dreadful thing attacking me.Firstly I drink loads and loads of water everyday. I drink at least 5 pints a day which makes me go to the loo quite a lot which flushes any sign of bacteria out. I have stopped drinking caffeine as this made me very constipated and was a factor of recurring UTI. I have also been diagnosed with IBS (Irrital Bowel Syndrome) so caffeine doesn't help with that either. When I'm constipated, I make sure I use senokot (not sure I have spelt that right). This is a constipation relief so helps get rid of bacteria around that area. I no longer drink fizzy drinks. I have also stopped eating spicy foods. I was also using condoms before for sexual intercourse but because I am with a long term partner I decided to get the injection. After having sex with a condom, every time I would get a UTI!I take represh pro b once a day and if I ever feel a UTI coming on or just after sex, I keep a supply of azo just as a back up, but I only really take these because I feel paranoid that I may get one but I don't.By doing these I haven't had a UTI in a few months now, hurray! So maybe these things may help for you but I recommend you give them a try!"

I had one was 11, 12, 15 and 3 in 2015 (20 yo) and two this year. The doctor said I should classify two of the three I had last year as one as technically it was the same infection because the antibiotics didnt kill them all off. Moving on I got my second one this year and I wanted to see what you lovely individuals thought. I've had two infections in each year 2 years in a row, both around the exact same time (April-May and September-October). This period of time is exactly when the last assignments are due for uni, the most stressful period where everything is due. This time is particularly hard because we also lost the family pet whom I had an extremely close bond with.The doctor says that the infections are highly likely triggered by stress and anxiety compromising my immune system. What do you guys think? Another one I wanted to discuss was what my doctor said about how normal my infections are. She said that getting two urinary tract infections a year for women who do get urinary tract infections like I do is very very normal and that I should not be worried. Again, what do you guys think?

I have had a total of 7 uti’s in the past 10 years, but have had them on and off since I was 3 years old. The ages I’ve had them are 3 (multiple), 9 (multiple), 11 (most painful I’ve ever had), 12, 15, 20 (x3) and 21. Ultra sounds when I was younger found nothing wrong. However, since I was 11, after a very painful infection, I have these flare ups that feel like minor infections and are just really irritable, but aren’t infections at all. Nothing is found in the samples. They can last from five minutes after I go to the toilet to up to a few days. They scare me a lot because I fear they may turn into a full blown infection. Is it possible that the horrible infection I had at age 11 could have caused some internal damage to cause these flare ups?I refuse to take antibiotics when I don’t know for sure if I have an infection as my biggest fear is the bacteria becoming resistant. My doctor did say that the amount of urinary tract infections I’ve had will not cause bacteria to become resistant and it has to be more frequent. What do you guys think? I was also wondering if anyone has experienced this issue before? I would see a specialist but here in Australia it’s too expensive for students and I currently don’t have the money to do it. I’ve chewed a couple of garlic cloves for now to see if that helps and have also drank a lot of lemon tea. Lemon although acidic when ingested has alkaline properties after digestion.

Here's an overview of what happened chronologically as that is the best way to explain.I woke up one morning and realized immediately that I had a UTI, as I have had them before. I went to my primary care doctor who did an in office leukocyte test that came back positive for a UTI. In fact, he said the test results were very high and that I absolutely had an infection. I was put on macrobid. I finished the macrobid and felt better, but a few days later I felt much worse. Most importantly, this urine sample was never sent out for a culture.I went back to my primary doctor and was this time put on Bactrim. After a few days I still did not feel better. I went to a urologist, who said that once I was off the antibiotics for several days, she could do a culture. I came back once I was off the antibiotics, still having symptoms, and my urine once again tested positive for a UTI with the leukocyte test, but the culture came back negative. She explained to me that I was likely just experiecing residual symptoms.This was roughly three months ago, and I now have another UTI. The same thing has happened, I had a positive leukocyte test and a negative/no growth culture.Additionally, I had had this happen to me several years ago as well.I am fully up to date with STI/STD testing, I am completely clean, and I am not pregnant.Is there a simple explanation for this inconsistency in test results or should I be worried that something more serious is causing symptoms that are similar to a UTI but are really not?"

Apparently I had a few when I was 3 but I don't remember them. One i can definitely remember was when I was 11. It was horribly painful and I remember sucking it up and going to school because i was too embarrassed to say anything. The pain was so great I would call for my mother. After that I had one when i was 12, 15, three when I was 20 and one this year at the age of 21. So I've had a total of 7 in the past 10 years. Urinary tract infections have ruined my sex life and have caused a massive fear of anything touching that area that isn't myself. I am too scared to get any sort of cervical smear or anything like that. Antibiotics always did the trick and worked out well.However, when I do NOT have an infection, occasionally I will get this burning sensation when I go to the bathroom. This has occurred ever since that first traumatic infection when I was 11. I have never had one as painful as that although they are all pretty terrible. Anyway, the burning sensation i am talking about is NOT a urinary tract infection. It feels more like skin burn,but it isn't. I think we all know with experience that a Urinary tract infection feels more of an internal pain as well as slightly external pain. The kind of pain I get in particular is a horrible stabbing sensation, like someone is shoving needles up through your urethra and into your bladder constantly once you've been to the bathroom.I've been looked at and there is nothing wrong with the skin in that area, so its not skin burning either. It occurs frequently, especially if I haven't had enough water and usually goes away within 5-10 minutes and doesnt come back possibly until the next time I use the bathroom. Mind you, this doesn't occur every single time I go to the bathroom, but it does occur more often than not. I was wondering if anyone else had this experience with some sort of odd burning sensation that doesnt involve actually having a urinary tract infection. It's not too painful at all, just irritating and makes me paranoid. Please give me some insight. I cannot afford a specialist or any kind of tests other than the initial consultancy fee (I am from Australia). "

I had no health insurance so I tried at home remedies for BV. Nothing worked.March 2016 - Started feeling UTI pain so I finally decided to drop $175 on a visit to an OBGYN. Was not given any tests because I couldn't afford it. Was prescribed Cipro, which worked but it came right back. A 2nd round did absolutely nothing.June 2016 - Finally got health coverage and saw a new doctor. Was tested for Candida, BV, Trich, STD's, all came back negative. Went for a pelvic ultrasound, results showed a small fibroid on my uterus and small cysts on my left ovary (was told not to worry, apparently related to my upcoming menstrual at the time)July 2016 - Still suffering from UTI pain, incontinence and foul smelling discharge/urine. Was advised by Dr to switch soaps and detergents to fragrance free, panties to cotton, eat more yogurt and try boric acid suppositories. Did all that to no avail.August 2016 - Finally tested for a UTI. Came back positive. Was prescribed Bactrim. Worked for 2 days. Second round did nothing, just like the Cipro.My OBGYN pretty much told me he didn't know what else to do.My PCP gave me a Urine Test which came back with high white blood cells but no bacteria..so no prescription.

I've had immense pain with every UTI I've ever had. However at the moment I am getting the slightest bit of pressure with the tiniest amount of aggravation (feels like a slight skin burn) when I got to the bathroom. It's nothing major, not painful, just annoying and making me very paranoid because I can't afford to get another during this university semester. I've noticed when I drink heaps of water beforehand it burns less, so I think it's possible my urine might just be acidic and its burning my skin.

For me uti's seemed to be related to sex so i became more careful following all the steps necessary for those who get uti's.I recently met the love of my life this year, we had 2 months of ""intimacy"" every day if not twice a day and no uti's then at the end of february i got one on a sunday morning, they usually come on within hours, recognised it straight away and was on cipro by afternoon and cleared it up, had no problems for 2 months till going to my lovers hometown. Felt a uti coming on but did not want to spoil the fun with his friends and family so i took some amoxicillan he had spare for two days and felt ok, did a test strip and it said i was infection free. Fast forward just over a week later and a raging uti came on (we hadnt even made love in 4 days before it came on, usually intimacy triggers it so this is concerning for me), i just suddendly needed the restroom bad and it kept getting worse so quickly. My guess is that it is the infection from vacation coming back as i did not treat it properly and ended up in the ER and was put on keflex for 5 days. I was infection free for exactly two weeks and now my uti came back again this morning. I was devastated. I did research and When i finished the keflex i took d mannose everyday and reduced our love making. I did not take it before intimacy yesterday morning as it was first thing but i had taken it the night before and after love making took alot of it after throughout the day yesterday but started to feel slight twinges of pain here and there. I used the restroom this morning and it felt like a uti and did an azo home test and it was positive and now i am back on Cipro for 7 days.Im scared because i dont know if it is a stubborn infection that wont go away (surely i would not have made it two weeks feeling good if an infection was still in there??) or if i got re-infected yesterday morning even though i followed all the right things to do. I keep having to go to an urgent care for the problem to strange nurses and doctors as i travel with work so i dont have a doctor to help me on this.

"Urinary Tract Infection","Was a UTI responsible for the extreme premature birth? (special case)","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/was-a-uti-responsible-for-the-extreme-premature-birth-special-case--517306","My partner and I became pregnant last year, with an expecting date of May 5th (just gone). Unfortunately we lost our little bundle of joy at 22 weeks. I'd like to get some feedback as to whether the loss occurred with a UTI as the likely cause, or if other factors at stake were the likely contributors. The death certificate states ""extreme prematurity"" as the cause with no autopsy having been completed to identify any further findings.Let me run through the pregnancy and a little history to help set the stage...7 years ago, my partner was involved in a severe vehicle accident from which she received a plethora of injuries and broken bones. Her pelvis was cracked in multiple places, right leg shattered with 37 pins and multiple plates inserted, damaged skull/face, rupture of internal organs and a host of other injuries. She has suffered from DVTs and has had a number of blood clots which required an IVC filter to stop any clot materials getting to her heart. She still has a main vein blockage that doctors have yet to successfully alleviate. The metal work was removed some weeks prior to the pregnancy due to bone and skin infections beginning to take hold. A heavy course of antibiotics were used and finished, also prior to the pregnancy. The doctors prescribed Warfarin to keep her blood thin enough to avoid further clotting, which had since been replaced with Clexane due to a previous pregnancy. Warfarin is lethal in pregnancy, hence the swap to Clexane. The doctors told her she would never conceive again and if it were possible, the chances of reaching term were extremely unlikely and at majorly high risk of enormous complications. Because of constant throbbing pain, she has been on a steady course of self-prescribed Paracetamol and Codeine tablets for her pain management, sometimes swapping to ibuprofen/codeine (not recommended when on Clexane blood thinners). She has a built up immunity to the codeine and as such, takes considerably more than the recommended doses of codeine based products to achieve the same effect.My partner's pregnancy history consists of a successful 32 week premature birth 8 years prior (also prior to the accident), a miscarriage, a fairly recent abortion to her ex, and of course our failed pregnancy. The medications she has been on prevent her from using birth control successfully. Tracking her cycle was near impossible as her body would not conform to norms and cycles could vary from 14 days to 2 months - more the former than the latter. Upon our relationship beginning, my partner was unknowingly suffering from acute vaginitis due to the antibiotics completely destroying all the good bacteria in her vaginal operation.Upon separating from a long term relationship 6 months prior to the beginning of our unity, she began to suffer from anxiety and medium depression. That has escalated over time, with the anxiety beginning to have major effects on her life and employment. She did trial a course of anti-depressants which lead to her nearly losing her job and her mind. She now takes, and has taken un-prescribed diazepam 5mg (Valium) on a regular basis - two per day on average, and continued from the beginning to the end of the pregnancy.To help flesh out the story, my partner has an addictive background in certain drugs. She is a regular cannabis high volume user (2-3 grams daily). She smokes 40 cigarettes daily. Will consume 1-3 glasses of wine or equivalent spirits on a nightly basis on return from her employment. She takes 10mg of Valium daily. Anywhere from 150-300mg codeine daily depending on her self-analysis of pain. She has been known to dabble in methamphetamines in a non-addictive behaviour (thankfully).So when we first suspected we were pregnant, she went into a denial phase which balanced on the idea that until she has seen a beating heart on an ultrasound, she would not be convinced that she was pregnant. That did not occur until near 6-7 weeks into the first trimester. During this period she continued to use all the above mentioned drugs and alcohol without any change in dosages. Unfortunately, after the ultrasound was completed and it was clearly evident that there was a live foetus with a beating heart, there was still no change in dosage of all drugs and alcohol mentioned. The personal doctor and the local hospital labelled the pregnancy as high risk from the moment it began and treated it as such throughout the entire cycle. My partner did not admit her personal addictions in fear of being judged or receiving a lesser extent of service.Throughout the entire pregnancy, my partner suffered constant pregnancy related sickness, manifesting in irregular vomiting and nausea. She complained of pain in her abdominal and lower back areas, with the normal constant pain of her shattered leg added on top. She was extra-ordinarily tired throughout the pregnancy also (not an over statement as I have witnessed 4 previous successful pregnancies with my own children of prior relationships).Being that her diet was dismal to say the least, she began to take vitamin supplements in the form of Blackomores Pregnancy and Breast Feeding Gold tablets, 10mg iron tablets, Swisse Women’s Ultivite tablets and probiotic capsules (to control the vaginitis).During the pregnancy, it should also be known that there were numerous relationship issues which increased stress, anxiety, and exhaustion. Numerous other family issues were prevalent and further added to the already stressful environment. It was the least ideal environment for any woman to have support a pregnancy.Numerous ultrasounds were performed throughout the pregnancy, with all results pointing towards a healthy baby. Correct size and weight readings when compared to averages all throughout the 2 trimesters. Nuchal scan was completed with successful/satisfactory results.Fast-forward to the final days of the pregnancy…Two days prior to the unexpected complications, my partner was very concerned with her pain levels and suggested we go to the hospital to monitor the situation. She was admitted into emergency and our downward spiral adventure began.They took blood and urine and performed numerous examinations both internal and external. My partner was experiencing Braxton-hicks contractions at 7-10 min intervals. The following day, another urine test needed to be taken as the results of the previous test were tainted. An ultrasound was also performed however it was incomplete as the appendix was unable to be identified as ‘normal’ – this was an issue as external pressure tests suggested a possibility of appendicitis. An MRI was suggested and scheduled for the next available opportunity (turned out to be late that afternoon as luck would have it). That evening it was suggested that a UTI was in play from the results of the successful clean catch on the second urine test. They flushed her system with IV targeted antibiotics to attack the infection and kept her in ‘short stay’ for further monitoring. The head of the paediatrics department was not convinced that the UTI was the cause of the pain and suggested we talk to the hospital surgeon general for further investigation and consultancy. A steady dose of 5mg oxycodone (morphine) tablets were prescribed and delivered on schedule by nurses throughout the night and day.Next morning we saw the surgeon general with the results of the previous evening’s MRI scan. She was also not convinced that a UTI could be the sole underlying issue. She examined the MRI results and cleared the appendix and all other visible organs, placenta and foetus as healthy. Another IV flush of antibiotics was completed. At this point, the pain had not decreased or increased, nor changed location. The doctors said we could remain in for monitoring or we could go home, provided she was forcefully rested and monitored (obviously by me). We took the home option as she was already infuriated by having to stay at the hospital as long as she had – her hospital history is large and she doesn’t bode well when confined to a hospital bed.The doctor provided a prescription of the oxycodone tablets, a reduced level of Clexane supply, and a course of antibiotics for the UTI. We left at 7pm that day and collected the prescriptions immediately. During the drive, she alerted me to every bump on the road coinciding with heavy pain in the aforementioned areas.We arrived home and I prepared the bed with every pillow and blanket in the house. Gave her all required doses of tablets and setup the tv and media centre for a few days of movies and rest. Everything seemed ok until out of the blue and without any related physical movement, her waters broke aggressively with a high pressure release causing her to go into psychological shock as she attempted to clean herself up. I assisted as much as I could, given the volatility of the situation. I spoke to the maternity ward staff who advised us to immediately return to the hospital for investigation. It took near an hour for my partner to settle out of an anxiety attack before I could safely transport her back to the hospital.Upon arrival, more tests were done – bloods, urine, internal and external tests. The foetus was still alive and had a healthy beating heart, although staff were obviously highly concerned with the waters breaking and the duration of the pregnancy being only estimated at 22 weeks. The kept us in and continued to monitor the situation. The head of paediatrics visited us again and this time, the news was not so good. He advised that there was a chance we could manage the pregnancy with drugs (stop the body going into labour) and begin a steroid treatment at 25 weeks to assist foetal lung development in preparation for a very premature birth.Unfortunately, about 6 hours later, the effects of the body’s natural induction of labour began to show when the umbilical cord made a 2 inch showing outside of the vagina. It was at this point that we knew it was all over.Without going into great detail, my partner chose to deliver naturally with the assistance of IV delivered synthetic induction (synthetic oxytocin). A six hour labour with 308mg of IV delivered morphine and a very upsetting delivery. She was taken off for a D&C (cleaning of the uterus) which was apparently successful. The hospital gave her lactation suppression tablets to dry up her breast milk and advised of all health and counselling services.She since went into complete denial of the excessive drug and alcohol usage leading into the premature birth, choosing to only identify with the UTI being the cause of the tragedy. We chose not to have an autopsy as I felt that doing so would protect her from being exposed for the prescribed and non-prescribed drug and alcohol usage being the contributor to the failure.If you have read all of this so far, I would like to firstly say thank you for taking the time to do so, and thanks in advance if you would be kind enough to add your feedback as to whether it should be assumed that the UTI was the cause of the premature birth, or if any/all of the lead-in factors were likely to be the contributing factors and the UTI was just a regular pregnancy occurrence as it is in over 50% of successful pregnancies worldwide. PS: I did research each of the drugs mentioned and their effects on pregnancy. I also researched drug interactions of multiple drugs which revealed some less than exciting information, especially in regard to interactions and pregnancy.Personally, I think a combination of the Clexane in the blood reducing the volume of oxygen to the uterus and foetus. Compound that with the oxygen thinning caused by smoking of cigarettes. Again compound that with Valium and excessive codeine which imbalances the body’s ability to manage and maintain systems responsible for successful foetal growth.It is an easily researchable fact from many reliable sources that UTIs are present in over 50% of successful, full and less than full term pregnancies where the child is born with absolutely no complications and the mother being completely unaware of the UTI throughout the entire pregnancy.Anyhow, I would love to know your thoughts, positive, negative or otherwise."

Anyway, I self catheterise, hence the reason I'm getting so many infections. I woke up my partner in agony, I had pain on my right side and it went from my back, side, tummy then down to my pelvis. Sometimes it was a stinging pain, sometimes it was really painful. But last night, jeez, I was in agony. The Dr tested it straight away and said I had a pretty bad infection (due to me not having any sensation in my urethra I don't get the early symptoms of burning when you pee etc so I normally end up noticing somethings wrong quite late). He said there was blood and protein in my urine but some of the other results were abnormal so he wanted to send it away for a full analysis. He put me on nitrofurantoin (least likely to cause cdiff) and told me to see my gp at the start of the week. However, tonight I've started getting worsening pain (not as bad as last night though) plus there is actually blood on the toilet paper after I empty my bladder. Should I phone them again and tell them I can actually see blood? What does it mean when there is blood there? Could it be that the infection has already reached my kidneys? I'm sort of worried bc they were saying I might need to go back into hospital and it's making me really anxious. If they're saying that they must expect me to potentially get worse and all I've done for the last year is spend the majority of it in hospitals. Does anyone have any ideas or similar experiences?

Trimethoprim wasnt working. it took the pain away temporarily but it came back two days later pretty bad even though I was still taking the trimethoprim. Went to my doctor, he prescribed me with Cephalexin after a urine sample that was VERY POSITIVE for bacteria and blood. Cephalexin has done the trick, i barely feel any pain. What I wanted to know was that if it was normal to feel a little bit of discomfort even after the cephalexin has started to kick in. it has only been 24 hours since i started taking it and although the pain is gone i am still very nervous as the trimethoprim didnt work and it came back worse within two days. I know I should know because ive had a history of them (since I was 3 years old), but every time it happens I automatically shut what occurred out and try to forget about it.

"Urinary Tract Infection","Current UTI immune to antibacterial medication?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/current-uti-immune-to-antibacterial-medication--514127","I am currently a 21 year old female university student.SO when i was 11 I had my first memorable urinary tract infection. My mother told me I had several when I was much younger and I would never let anyone touch me for example when she tried to dry me when i got out of the bath. Anyone I was 11, got it at an event. I had horrible diet. My parents let me drink up to two cans of coke a day until I turned thirteen and decided to come off it myself. I was overweight and what not. Anyway the pain was so horrific, like knives cutting away inside you and that is not an exaggeration. Went to school, ended up going to the bathroom frequently crying all day. Eventually went home told my mother and got it diagnosed and treated. the horrible pain went away but ever since then I have had the occasional burning sensation when i go to the toilet howver its always been nothing. Ive been told by doctors its likely just sensitive skin. Ive had ultra sounds done and they haven't found anything whatsoever. Anyone those aren't actually infections its just burning sensations that go away within five minutes of going to the toilet. Thats fine and dandy, but sometimes its hard to tell between it being the beginning of an intense uti and just the usual burning. I can live with the burning to be honest. I really can its not at all that bad. However in the past 10 years I've had 7 urinary tract infections. One when in 2006, 2007, 2010, three in 2015 (technically two because the second infection of that year was not properly treated and it simply came back) and one just now. I have always been given cephalexin OR trimethoprim. I know people have more serious issues. They get uti's every other day and its horrible. I cannot imagine what its like to have that experience. Anyway this experience is a little different because usually the medication kicks in within 24 hours after diagnosis. However, i am still feeling pain and its been a day and a half, almost two. The pain has DEFINITELY decreased, but there is still a little bit of irritation. I am just curious if this means the strain of e.coli affecting me is becoming immune or if i just have to be patient. Please help. Im terrified. I have tests coming up for university and it is slowly ruining my relationship. "

In the evening I could not pee and my stomach was really swollen so I called 111 who made an emergency appointment with a doctor. This led to a hospital referral so I went straight away. At the doctor's and the hospital I managed to pee 3 times which was difficult and I could not empty my bladder. It didn't feel painful to pee at this point, nor had it earlier in the day when I could pee like normal.I had a scan which showed I had 850mls of urine in my bladder so the nurse put in a catherer and I had to spend the night in hospital. I had it in for maybe 8 hours - it was removed at about 6am. The doctor said I had a UTI which suprised me as I'd had no symptoms, though I've never had one before. After the catheter was out I had to pee into a container twice so the nurses could measure the amount (500mls altogether) and both times I only got a burning sensation after finishing. I told the nurse and she said it was the UTI. Whilst I was waiting to be discharged I peed again and it was very painful so I had to keep stopping. I was jumping off the seat with the burning. For the rest of the day, back at home, peeing wasn't that painful or the burning would only come at the end. Today however is different and I have just screamed the house down throughout a long excruiating pee. What can I do to relieve the pain? I only got antibiotics from the hospital and only started them yesterday. I need to go to the toilet but I can't take how painful it is.I also don't understand how this is a UTI since I had no pain until the catheter was removed.

After I'd had it for a few days there was no visible blood in the urine but when I wiped it was slightly red as if blood might be present. I'm at university and was coming home the next day so decided to leave it and go to the doctors when I was back at home. By the time I got home all symptoms had gone including the blood so I decided to leave it. Now a few days later some of the symptoms have flared back up but there has so far been no sign of blood. Do I make an emergency appointment at the doctors or should I wait a few days to see whether it goes away on its own?"
"Urinary Tract Infection","4+ UTIS and on my 3rd Kidney Infection since June.","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/4-utis-and-on-my-3rd-kidney-infection-since-june--491812","I have never really posted on any board before, so I don't know what to do or what to say. But. I am currently experiencing my 5th UTI and the pain is beginning to radiate to my back already; I believe I have a kidney infection for the third time in under a year. I just turned 18 years old during the holiday and I never really had a problem with UTIs until 8 months ago when I had my first kidney infection. It was the worst pain I had ever experienced. It would constantly throb and ache like I had a knife lodged inside. I had the UTI for a week prior and I was just using monistat since that had worked for me the one other time I had one, and when the pain reached my back I didn't tell my mom until three days after and I was taken to the hospital right then. Anyways, they gave me strong antibiotics and sent me on my way home after hours of IV tries and ultrasounds. They were unable to get an iv (I'm a very hard stick - 20 tries in one night) so I could not have a CT scan. The urine test came back and confirmed I had a UTI, and they thought they saw a large stone on the ultrasound but it was later confirmed just a shadow. The antibiotics worked wonderfully and I finished the bottle like instructed. After a few weeks I had another UTI, so I went to see my doctor and I was given more antibiotics. I didn't think anything of it and I just took my medicine as instructed. I don't remember what it was called, but it was a stronger antibotic since I have been on them so many times in my life that the effects of some are not enough because I've grown used to them.My third and fourth UTI snuck up on me about three and a half weeks after my second and that was when I was kind of worried. I know something is not right, but I don't have an ob/gyn to consult with as I'm not sexually active. So I went to my doctor again and I was diagnosed with another kidney infection in the opposite one and sent off with more antibiotics and that single pill that clears up the uti (i don't remember the name). I thought that it had finally worked and I was going to be a-okay until Dec. 23rd when I got my fifth UTI. I went to the hospital, was given a shot (a steroid, maybe? All I know is that it burned) and it cleared up until the day after my birthday on the 28th. I haven't been able to get out to my doctor yet for antibiotics and I'm not a fan of hospitals so now I'm beginning to have flank pain all the way up to beneath my right shoulderblade, along with the constant burning sensation that is driving me out of my mind. Here are all the things I've tried to do to clear it up;- Tons of water.- Cranberry juice.- Yogurts.- 7 and 3 day Monistat (I now only use topical because I do not want to end up resistant to that as well).-Cut everything chocolate or sugary out of my diet.- No baths. These work for a few days, but when I stop it comes right back. This was rather lengthy but Is there anything that could be causing these reoccuring UTIs and kidney infections that I should bring up to my doctor? Because whenever I go there, I pee in a cup and get sent home with antibiotics and ""this will nip it in the bud!"" but it's back within a few weeks. Is there any other reason for all of this - what can I do to stop it?"

I was in hospital for 8 days, treated with iv antibiotics and fluids. I have been housebound ever since with all encompassing fatigue. Some days I can't get out of bed and struggle to lift my arms. Other days I can make it downstairs for a few hours, but can't do daily tasks. My ongoing symptoms along with the fatigue are episodes of shaking, dizziness, thirst and frequent urination. The last time this happened I had 3+ glucose in my urine and a non fasting blood glucose level of 11.7. My GP suspected diabetes and did a blood test which came back negative. Yesterday, I had a bowel of cornflakes with sugar and 2 hours later I was shaking in bed, so dizzy I could not stand or walk on my own or speak due to feeling so ill. It gradually subsided over several hours. My remaining symptoms seem to flare up and the fatigue gets extreme after eating sugar or unrefined carbohydrates. Given I've been tested negative for diabetes but continue to have terrible fatigue and these shaking episodes, im wondering whether my frequent UTI's, debilitating fatigue and recent kidney infection are somehow related to glucose intolerance. Any advice or similar experiences appreciated.Thank you"

Meanwhile, I will appreciate if someone can give me some light on this and if some one had a similar problem because honestly all the doctors I've seen so far dont really know whats going on or have little knowledge of this problem, I sort of sense their insecurity. Overall, my hopes are low.... The e.coli is also constantly causing vaginal infections as well... I believe my ph levels go unbalanced once the bacteria travels to the vagina causing bad odor and even yeast infections, vaginosis, etc. HORRIBLE. I even tried to get a plastic surgery recently and they will not operate with an existing infection. I've heard as well that long term infection can cause other problems...evern for future maternity.

A few days later I would get really ill with a kidney infection and given antibiotics. It then became more common to get them without drinking. I would also inbetween this get reucurring bladder infections.I am 19, a female, and have had various tests (ct scan, dye put in my arm through a drip to see any problems clearer and a few ultrasounds) done to check the structure of my kidney is all okay and that there isnt any obstructions ( all seems to be okay, and they didnt think that it would be worth looking with a cystoscope just yet.) However something worth noting is that I always seem to have invisible blood in my urine that is discovered through dipstick tests. And recently my brother has been having the same kidney problems (kidney infection, especially after drinking alchohol). I am also now on medication called 'Hiprex' it has antiseptic qualities to try and prevent getting UTI's/kidney infections however doesnt seem to be working as I still get them. Really getting fed up now, as when I get ill with it I get super achey, all of my glands swell up, a dry mouth so constantly thirsty and weeing loads, especially at night, and dull aches in my back.Once when passing urine I passed out from a pain in my right lower side. But like i said, no kidney stones or any problems structurely.Has anyone else been going through this too? Any ideas what could be wrong?Thanks "

"Urinary Tract Infection","MY CURE FOR UTI?! ","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-cure-for-uti--398421","hello. So I posted to this forum a few months ago about having recurring Utis. After having 7 in 7 months. The last one taking over 2 weeks to finally start feeling better with 2 courses of antibiotics. After reading about Uti on here from other sufferers someone mentioned the fact they thought that their birth control was what was giving them Uti. I googled this and found that there is no scientific evidence to support this but it has been heard of that birth control has been thought to have caused Uti. The pill mainly. So I decided last month to come off of my birth control. Today marks the first month of me not taking my pill and honestly I have felt so much better. I haven't gotten a Uti and its my first full month clear from Uti. I haven't got any pain when I urinate and I used to get pains all day everyday. But now I feel no pain at all. Nothing. It's great. I don't know if it is because of me not taking my birth control but I thought I'd try it out when I heard about it because I started to get UTis just after I started taking the birth control pill so when I heard someone else thinking it was their pill i was like 'omg that's so obvious it could be that' I'm going to stay off my birth control for another month to see if it is that I'm off the pill which is stopping the pains and Uti from coming and then find an alternative birth control. For now I am so happy that I have hopefully found the cause. Just thought I'd post this so maybe you could try it too or it may add up for you too that it might be the pill causing your Uti. hope you're all well! X"

I have had them in the past very rarely (one, maybe two a year) but am now having minimum one per month, if not more.I went to one urologist who basically told me it was normal and to keep taking antibiotics in the hope it will eventually pass. I couldn't accept that answer and went to get a second opinion from another urologist yesterday.He is performing a cystoscopy next Thursday to check for anything wrong internally with my urethra or bladder (very nervous for this, anyone have advice or know what its like?).He also told me he has had cases where with one partner women have no UTI's and then they end up switching to someone else and they get them all the time. So I asked the obvious question, will this always happen to me with my current boyfriend? I got the dreadful answer, yes.I burst into tears the whole way home and wondered how I was meant to tell my boyfriend. I don't know how I feel about this always happening with him, nor do I think it is fair for him to have sex with me knowing I will most likely get another infection and be in pain.He took it pretty well and said he would stay by my side no matter what, but has this happened to anyone else?I was prescribed a low dose antibiotic to take after sex to help prevent a UTI and I have been on and off Macrobid for months now.Has anyone else had this before?

"Urinary Tract Infection","Water infection?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/water-infection--301399","This morning at 1.40am I woke up with excruciating, colicky pain in my groin and it hurt to shift position in bed, sit up, stand or walk. The pain had me doubled over and I stayed up yet continued to have these waves of intense colicky pain in my groin. This carried on until 4.20am and the pain reduced when I went for a wee, even more so when I put a hot water bottle on me. I collected samples from both the early morning wee and the later morning wee and I'm now waiting for anything to come back. This isn't the first time I've had pain like this but I'm now worried it's something bad, especially since I've introduced more water into my diet, have had repeated urinary tract infections, protein in my urine and white bits in my urine this time around. Can someone advise? I'm a 29yr old female. Thanks"
"Urinary Tract Infection","Pyelonephritis","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/pyelonephritis-31711","I have just had my second bout of pyelonephritis in two months, the second one being far more severe than the first one. I don't get any lead up clues to the infection and the first signs I get are numerous rigors (severe shaking and shivering) and then pain in the kidney area and sickness. It appears to come on so quickly and I have just spent three days in hospital on intravenous antibiotics to help clear the infection with more oral antibiotics to take at home. I do have to send off another urine sample when I have finished the course of treatment but my main concern is that I don't get any earlier warnings to get help before it gets so acute."
"Urinary Tract Infection","I need advice and help","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/i-need-advice-and-help-285138","Hi, thanks for reading this, this is actually rather hard to discuss and I don't know why I feel so.... ashamed about it I guess.I've looked at the information on the site, comparing symptoms and such to give an idea of what it may be that is causing me issues, and I feel it's a UTI.I'm more concerned by the fact that yesterday I was completely fine, with no issues at all, but then I woke up during the night, about 3am, and went to urinate. At first, it was fine, steady stream, slight color, but then I felt a sudden pain, and I couldn't finish, but at the end, I didn't notice straight away, I was producing bloody urine. Since 3am, I have been nearly a dozen times, each time the same issue, same problems, intense pain, added pressure as I want to finish but the pain stops me, then the blood droplets. I have contacted my GP concerning this, and they would like a urine sample, which I'll be getting to them tomorrow unless I decide to just cut my penis off and be done with the pain.But since that call, and my latest trip to the bathroom, I am more worried by the fact I had to basically pull a blood clot from myself after I stopped urinating. Adding this to the symptoms wasn't exactly easy, but it appears Bladder Cancer is higher on the list than before.I am severely worried, but I am hoping it's just a UTI, and was wondering if anyone else has had this happen with a UTI, seeing as this is a sudden occurance and exceedinly painful. Any advice, help, or information will be greatly appreciated.Matt01665"

"Urinary Tract Infection","Possible complications from UTI?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/possible-complications-from-uti--273993","Hi , I went to doctors back in April and was told that i had UTI and given Trimethoprim. I was initially given 3 days course but could tell it had not cleared so went back and they gave me 4 more days. I was feeling better as had pains in lower back and could feel it going to my kidneys at the time. After about a week though i was getting a dull occasional pain on my left side which I stupidly ignored. Since then I have been having multiple symptoms which come and go as they please. Waves of dull burning aching on my lower back, Stomach and groin cramps, only occasional burning when peeing, but do feel burning down in vaginal area more recently. Still get occasional dull aches normally on left side just at top of ribcage. I also get strange pulsating in body in different areas like a weird rumble ?Ive had enough of it and even though not in excruciating pain i find it difficult to walk for extended lengths of time as my lower area is just nagging and feels like it needs to rest. Will be going to Doctors next week but just wondered if anyone else has experienced anything like this - if it could be to do with UTI at all?Thanks in advance "

But over the last 4/6 weeks I've been having some issues with my urine and a sensation that there is pressure on my bladder. It feels like I need to urinate more often and the feeling to urinate is there almost consistently throughout the day.I have had the following tests so far with all results coming back absolutely fine!: Blood Test, STD test (including separate Chlamydia + Gonorrhoea tests), Urine tests and also a bladder ultrasound. I'm becoming really frustrated and also quite depressed about the whole thing as it's quite embarrassing and also very annoying! Any suggestions or experiences would be great! I'm taking cranberry tablets a couple of times a day and also multivitamins.Thank you "
"Urinary Tract Infection","Recurring UTI - Advice Needed","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/recurring-uti-advice-needed-38460","Ive been having recurring UTI's since the beginning of the year. They sometimes spread to my kidney causing an infection. I get anti-biotics, usually a 7 day course, and within a couple of days of finishing them the infection comes back. Its worth mentioning that the antibiotics do get rid of the infection after a couple of days although I always finish the course as directed.I was referred to a Urologist and had an ultra sound scan, xray and cycstoscopy - all were fine and revealed no problems apart from the ultra sound which showed one kidney enlarged. The urologist said that this was nothing and Id probably had it since birth. He sent me away and said everything is fine, your probably just going through a bad patch, go to the gp for more antibiotics if the infection returns.The infection has returned, as I have now become used to. I will go back to the gp and get more antibiotics but I was wondering if anyone else has this?? is this to be my life for the next 40 or 50 years? there must be something that is causing the infection??I drink lots of water and do everything else Im supposed to."

"Urinary Tract Infection","11 years of Kidney Infections","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/11-years-of-kidney-infections-20333","For the past 11 years I have been suffering from recurrent kidney infections, reading all the other posts on here makes me feel like Im not totally alone in this as no-one else seems to really understands.I have been off work for the past 2 days with another infection, on monday I started to get the familiar signs, needing to pee more often, agonising pain in my side, headachy and generally feeling really fluey. I managed to get a docs appointment on tues where he confirmed it was a kidney infection and gave me antibiotics. Im pregnant so was panicking about having to cope with no drugs, thank god I can take a certain type as each time I get an infection I am almost certain I am going to die ! Seriously its that bad, about 6 years ago I was sent for a colonoscopy and endoscopy but nothing was detected on that, since then I have always been told that the infections are just recurrent and that some people are suseptable to them. On tues I asked the doctor if it could be anything else as the terrible pain is always, always only on my right side and in exactly the same place, I was told to just come back if the antibiotics dont work. Im beginning to think I may have a kidney stone as the pain is a lot worse when I need to pee and when I am going, I am constantly taking time off work and being a manager of a department in a hotel Im sure people think Im skiving all the time.Do I have to live with this forever ?"
