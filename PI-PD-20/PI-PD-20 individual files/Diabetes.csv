Diabetes,Persistent hypoglycaemia at 21,"I am going to go to the doctors for advice and bloods asap but thought it might be worth looking on here for advice or anyone that has anything similar.I am 21, female and recently have started having persistent hypoglycaemia. I have suffered with hypoglycaemia since 14/15. I have always assumed it is hypoglycaemia by the shaking, uncomfortableness and loss of concentration and usually upon having food or something sweet it goes away.I have recently dieted and lost 1.5 stone. I am 5'3 and 9st. Whilst heavily dieting (800-1000cals a day) i had managed to get the hypos under control and had none at all. I am now eating more and have not been hardcore dieting for at least a month and now the hypos are bad. 15-20 mins into a walk I get hot, shakey, feel very uncomfortable and get tunnel vision/feel spaced out.i work in diabetes type 1 and have always wondered if this is a possibility. any thoughts?thanks!"
Diabetes,gained weight and think I have diabetes - scared ,"hi, hope everyone is safe and well 😃Sorry for the extra long post and TMII'm a 22 year old female, 5ft 8.4inches and currently 263lbs with a waist size of 43 inches.After 6 years I have only just managed to get my binge eating disorder under control and am really trying to take care of my health now but I fear it may be far too late for me 😦 I am so worried that I have developed diabetes due to my unhealthy eating habits and inactive lifestyle for the last 2 yearsI started rapidly gaining weight in around August 2018, before this I fluctuated between 190lbs-230lbs. 200lbs seems to be healthy for me due to my height and my race (my mum is black Jamaican and my dad is white Turkish) and i feel and look healthy at that weight. In January 2019 I got diagnosed with PCOS which I am sure is down to my weight gain. In February this year I reached my highest weight ever of 284.2lbs as I was binging pretty much every single day but I have now lost 20lbs / 1-2lbs per week since then and will continue to lose more.My mum is obese with type 2 diabetes which she developed when she was pregnant and my dad is overweight so I feel like I'm at such a high risk especially having PCOS as well which can cause insulin resistance. I've also had a sedentary desk job since 2017 which hasn't helped but since working from home i've been working out 3-5 times a week.How long does it take for diabetes to develop, is 21 months of unhealthy habits a relatively short time? Can type 2 diabetes be reversed by losing weight?I don't know if this is a symptom but since maybe November I have noticed sometimes my bladder doesn't feel fully empty straight after going to the toilet and I also went through a few months period where I felt like I was hungry all the time and never full but I don't feel that at all now and i always feel satisfied eating 1500 - 1800 calories a day. I haven't binged, had takeaway food or alcohol in 3 months and haven't had a cigarette in over 2 years.I don't know if this is relevant / any of these could be indicators of diabetes but I have had my iron, cholesterol, liver function and CRP tested last week and they are all normal / optimal but I do have an under-active thyroid. My blood pressure ranges from 120 - 135I've spoken to 2 GP's and they've both told me not to worry because I'm young and to just focus on losing weight, they seem to think the diabetes test can wait until after the virus has settled but my anxiety is through the roof!please be kind - I'm just looking for reassurance if there is any, I know i shouldn't have let myself get to this weight and I know I need to lose weightthank you 😃"
Diabetes,HyperInsulinemia (high insulin levels),"I am 38 now and I have high insulin levels, and barely elevated blood glucose levels. Doctor is treating high insulin with metformin and Trulicity. So far it hasn't had much effect.When I was 17, I was diagnosed as being hypoglycemic. When I workout I still have to make sure I have some kind of snack with me for if/when blood sugar drops.Would high insulin be treated differently if I didn't have insulin resistance or elevated blood glucose levels?Would prolong high levels of insulin cause insulin resistance?"
Diabetes,Diabetes Insipidus...or is it? A possible cure? ,"I am creating this thread in the hope it can be a place of hope and support for those with diabetes insipidus (or health issues that mimick this condition) and also possibly provide information to help some people resolve their symptoms, or dare I say it, find a cure.First, please let me state I am not a medical professional so please do your own research, I'm am just sharing my thoughts and ideas.From my research over the past 2 years I have reached the conclusion that many people diagnosed with cranial diabetes insipidus, particularly idiopathic cranial diabetes insipidus may have a different underlying condition that may be causing their symptoms and may actually be able to resolve these issues and possibly cure the disease.I find new cases whenever I look, of diabetes insipidus that has gone into remission or gone away after a patient has taken certain medications for conditions not thought to be related to diabetes insipidus.There seems to be a link between immunosuppressent drugs given to patients that has often resulted in the symptoms of diabetes insipidus disappearing. Could diabetes insipidus for some people actually be caused by an autoimmine condition? And some medications taken for autoimmine issues can possibly resolve diabetes insipidus?I'm my opinion there are those with diabetes insipidus due to genuine pituitary / hypothalamus issues be it from a tumor, inflammation, head trauma etc but there are also those who have an autoimmine condition which somehow suppress vasopressin. I also believe there are those that do not have anything organically wrong with their production of vasopressin but for some reason the body has become confused and has become hypersensitive to fluid intake and believes the body needs far less fluid then is actually adequate. As if the water level for the body has been lowered dramatically and whenever you try and hydrate the body instantly wants to dump the fluids out but at the same time people with this issue can still produce vasopressin and their condition often fluctuates.I have probably said enough for now but I will share some studies and stories of diabetes insipidus in my next posts.Please feel free to get involved and share your experiences and ideas on this subject and if you kmow of any stories of improvement/cure of diabetes insipidus please post them here.I will find a way. Thank you."
Diabetes,Constantly thirsty. Waking up with extreme thirst. Is there a chance I have diabetes?,"Hi everyone,I am 21 years old and I have a symptom that has really been bothering me. I keep waking up every morning with deathly thirst and am drinking a ton of water only to continue feeling thirsty throughout the day.I am 5 feet 8 inches tall and 217 pounds, so my BMI isn't exactly the best. When I search the internet for my symptom, diabetes is the main result, but I believe I would have had to develop prediabetes first to get diabetes. My last blood glucose level was 87 mg/dL which was taken 10 months ago and the normal range is between 70 and 99 mg/dL, so it was normal back then.Does it sound like I could have diabetes, or am I just kidding myself? I have bad health anxiety but this seems like it could be a possibility.Thanks for reading."
Diabetes,Diabetes Insipidis ,Just wondering why i Haven’t heard anything on diabetes insipidus for a long time just wondering if there’s anything new happening. Thank you Rod
Diabetes,Diabetes and low kidney function.,"I think I may have posted about this a few months ago but not sure.I went to GP surgery back end of last year with what I thought was a simple UTI.They took blood and called me back in a few days later as they were concerned about the results and wanted to talk to me.Blood sugar was high and also kidney function was low.They changed one of my tablets and continued to take blood every month till March.They then said sugars had come down and kidney function had improved.So I was pleased and now only test my blood sugar once or twice a week.What I am confused about is blood sugar is still high when I test it it was 21.6 yesterday evening but I have no symptoms of diabetes such as thirst, needing to go to the toilet a lot sweating even when it is this high.Sarah"
Diabetes,Ozempic weekly shot,I am just over a month of diabetes diagnosis. I was put on metformin twice a day. I just went to new primary care and she wants to add Ozempic injections once a week. She says it has also helped with weight loss. Has anyone tried this yet? And if so any advice or reviews?

Diabetes,"Heavy Head Sensation, lightheaded, Digestion","Hi can anyone help?So long story long, I got flu-like symptoms back in early January. I got over it but eventually I developed vertigo, ear fullness, facial tension and a swollen head feeling. That swollen feeling moved around my head at times causing me headaches.It honestly made me feel like passing out at times. Still not sure if it was due to panic attacks or actual physical symptoms.Eventually doctor classified it as inner ear infection.The thing is since the doctors visit a couple weeks ago I started to develop odder sensations.Now I am so fatigued. Like beyond tired especially after I eat. It makes me want to pass out. The thing is I took a comprehensive blood panel already and came back good except for a little high cholesterol and a somewhat low vitamin d deficiency.But Ive never felt this way before. I can feel my heart beating louder (not necessarily faster) after I eat or after I walk for extended periods.The doctor said my blood test showed no signs of being pre diabetic.Honestly, it feels like my head has so much pressure but my body is so weak.Whats going on here. Ear infection affecting my nerves? Something else? Cancer?I was a somewhat healthy guy leading up to the new year. Gym 3-4 times out of the week.5'7male29 yrs old175 lbsPlease any advice would be amazing."
Diabetes,Systemic Poor Circulation and Generalized Tingling,"I was never informed, not once in my life, that systemic poor circulation could kill a person.I've never heard ""systemic poor circulation"" mentioned as a cause of death in obituaries or coroner's reports.I never even thought about it because who does? Maybe everyone did but I failed to notice.If I die from the ongoing crisis that's currently ailing me thenmy cause of death would indeed be SYSTEMIC POOR CIRCULATION.I can't drink half a glass of juice without hours of tingling.I FEEL like my blood vessels are in a TIGHT ache.My blood vessels don't feel right. I never FELT my blood vessels before this CRISIS set in.I FEEL INSIDE MY HANDS: STRANGE TIGHTNESS AND TINGLING.My veins were never puffy before this, now they are.I don't know for certain what's going on, though I have suspicions, and it's scaring me.I layed up for four years after college.In the Walmart parking lot one night in 2017,a few hours before I went home to sleep,I consumed a 1lb bag of pretzels & 1.6 quarts of CALCIUM enriched orange juicewhich was about 500 grams of sugar.I woke up tingly and numb.I started working in Sep 2018 and have medical benefits with my employer.I didn't check my blood pressure even once until I was almost 29after ongoing intracranial pressure that seems like encephalopathy set in last Aug,and woke me up each night for about five days.I don't know if it's diabetic, hepatic, hypertensive, or renal. It was 170/110.I know way more about nutrition than I did then.I know calcium is bad for blood pressure and magnesium is much preferable.I know you don't need molybdenum often because your liver reuses it,and selenium, manganese, chromium, and iron are similarly lower priority.Mg, K, Cu, Zn, and I are the main minerals to worry about.Vitamins A, D, and E are lower priority than B vitamins, C, and K.Omega-3 and choline are concerns, but you'll get your aminos from pretty much whatever you eat.I can't eat salt, excess calcium, or carbs without feeling pressure in my headlike a balloon inflated or a boiled egg slithered inside my brain causing it to press against the skull.I also feel my heartbeat inside my skull, pressure behind+inside my eyes, and facial tingling when this happens.I've had several episodes after trying to start an olive/avocado/algae oil keto where I feltlight headed, faint, and queasy that went away when I drank a couple swallows of something sugary.image"
Diabetes,Worried High sugar levels,Basically i think i have diabetes and im worried so far i have no symptoms at all but my blood sugar was 7.9 2 days ago that worried me a lot so i fasted for 15 hours and only drank water bearing in mind i had barely any sugar the days before then after my 15 hour fast i had boiled eggs i then done my blood sugar which was 6.8 i then done it about 20 seconds later and it was then 6.9 i have no symptoms but i have a cold and apparently that can increase your blood sugar levels should i be worried? my fast was only water and i still hadnt had any sugar at all from 12am to when i done the test
Diabetes,Any home remedies for pill replacement?,"I work for a crappy company with crappy insurance. All of a sudden they refuse to pay for my Januvia, and I ran out today.I've emailed my Dr., but will probably be Wednesday before I hear from him.Are there any ""home remedies"" that can substitute for Januvia for a few days?Will I be ok if I don't have this medication until I'm able to get a replacement?Thanks"
Diabetes,"Shoulder pain, occassional tingling in fingers","hello,i have had shoulder pain in my right shoulder for the last 4-5 months. this isn't severe and i am able to lead a very active life. i also have occasional tingling in my fingers of both hands.i checked my fasting blood sugar in Jan 2019 and in Aug 2019 and both times my blood sugar levels were normal. my urine test was also normal for sugar.any other possibilities for this pain and tingling?"
Diabetes,Diabetes and low kidney function.,I have had Diabetes Type 2 for a few years now.I recently went to GP surgery as I had symptoms of a urine infection.As well as producing a urine sample I also had my blood taken.Urine sample was clear but result of blood was more worrying.My blood sugar is higher than it should be and it has started to affect my kidney function which is now at 45%.They have changed one of my tablets and are monitoring me carefully.The thing that concerns me most is my kidney function.In 2017 I was diagnosed with kidney stones. Waited all year and eventually had PCNL surgery to remove the stones which was successful. I was a difficult and complicated case as I have horseshoe kidneys (they are joined together) which meant access to the stones was a lot more difficult.
Diabetes,Nothing lowered my blood sugar other than working out is that normal? ,"hey all, so basically i have diabetes type 2, i tried taking insulin and other types of pills such as Glucophage, NOTHInG lowered my blood sugar so i stopped all medication related to diabetes. every morning it rises to 180 until i eat something for it to stop getting higher... when i eat lately maximum it reaches 250. so i tried working out. that day it was 222 i worked out for 15 min went down to 184 then i decided to experiment and workout another 15 min and went down to 160... is that normal? no drug lowered it ( i actually gained 10 kg from insulin injections ) but workouts were the only way? I mean normal people control them with medication...Thank you for answering"
Diabetes,Insulin worked finally after injecting on the left side ,"hello all, many times i injected my Insulin on and off on the right side of the abdomen. then i made the rotation. I never had my insulin working until i injected myself on the left side. usually my morning blood-sugar levels are around 180+ now its getting lower everyday just by injecting on the left side... why wasn't it working on the right side for years? ( on and off) cause i thought it wasn't working."
Diabetes,Relation between testosteron and diabetes,"hello,what is the relation between diabetes and testosterone? i am a female i have diabetes type 2. i took testosterone for a year for personal reasons.I was diabetic freee!! anyways what substance in testosterone or what hormone actually did that?Now i am taking insulin its not working much. its like im not taking anything. And my stomach got screwed...when i was on testosterone my blood sugar was maximum 90 after eating.is there anything i could do? other than taking testosterone?thank you"
Diabetes,URGENT: lactic acidosis or (harmless) metformin side-effects?,"Hi,My endocrinologist put me on metformin for my PCOS (to start 500 mg with food, in the morning and in the evening). I started 3 days ago and took altogether 500 mg doses.1st day - I was fine2nd day - I started feeling tired (but it so happens that there's a lot of work to be done and I haven't slept well)3rd day (yesterday) - I took my morning dose and around lunch time I noticed that I'm not hungry at all. I felt tired but I didn't sleep well and i worked all morning. Sometime in the afternoon I started feeling a bit nauseous but it went away after a nap. We went to dinner at our friends' house. I ate a lot of food I normally do not eat (foie gras, creamy desert...). Early in the night I started feeling more and more nauseous and I threw up. I felt week, as I always do when I throw up.This morning I feel tired and a bit weak and I plan to stay in bed. My appetite is back.The symptomrs I mentioned could be common metformin side-effects but also they can point to lactic acidosis.Could lactic acidosis be caused by only 5 low doses of metformin?I have no kidney, liver, lung or heart problems.Thank you!"
Diabetes,What foods can you eat to increasse insulin production,"Diabetes is a lack of insulin......the body makes insulin out of stuff the person eats. So which food contribute to insulin production?I have diabetes type 2A...that is, i only suffer if i binge heavily on sugary foods...but sometimes, i eat sugary foods in excess and dont suffer my usual diabetes induced problem (lack of sleep)...i am convinced its because i have unwittingly eaten foods that contribute to insulin production."
Diabetes,Do you think a health app can help you manage you diabetes?,"Is there anyone who uses the Apple Health Records app to manage their diabetes? If you're an Android user, would you be interested in getting the same service? I'm not selling anything, I'm a freelance journalist and I'd like to get patient experience, people who are interested in getting their health records on their phones and how it has changed their lives or at least in some capacities.Thank you,"

Diabetes,Omezpic good or bad,I started omezpic 2/3 months ago and I'm regretting it ever since I started it! I've had side effects since I started it which I feel sick most of the time but kept telling myself they will get better! I started on 0.25 then 0.50 finally 1.0 am I alone in having such side effects or am I just unlucky I'm losing weight but I'm unhappy with the side effects im posting on here because it's such a new drug in the uk there's very little information out with the drugs companies sites!

Diabetes,Concerned about having type 2,"Hey everyone, sorry for the long post. A little background. I’m a 21 year old female in nursing school. No history of high BP or anything. I’m overweight and my grandmother has diabetes type 2 so it’s always been a worry in the bAck of my head that I may get it some day. Well at the beginning of the semester we were talking about diabetes in class and not sure why but it sent me into a panic wonder if I had the disease (I have a history of anxiety, I tend to worry excessively about things, but not formally diagnosed.) basically, since we began talking about diabetes in class, I’ve had the symptom of frequent urination. I’ve always seemed to go slightly more often than my friends ever since I was little but that’s normal for me. Lately, I feel like I have to go every hour or 2 and am constantly checking my body as to whether or not I have to go. It seems to be more frequent when I’m home and worrying. But it’s not like an overwhelming urge to go, just a feeling that my bladder is somewhat full. When I’m out or busy, not thinking about it I tend to go normally about 6-8 times a day. I also don’t get up at night to go. I don’t have any excessive thirst, blurred vision, yeast infections, slow healing, tingling, nothing like that. Just the sometimes frequent urination. I also don’t drink much water. When I do go it’s not a huge amount and sometimes I’ll go every 30 mins just to “check”. We had to take our blood glucose at school one day for a lab and mine was 98 but that was 2 hours after having a bacon egg and cheese on a roll lol. Of course I wonder if the glucometer gave me a falsely low reading. I’m just getting so nervous that I have diabetes but not sure if I should get checked at the doctor, help"

Diabetes,Type II diabetes and semen,My boyfriend has Type II Diabetes. There's always a smell in my vagina from it. Sometimes it lingers for 2-3 days. I can't stand it. Suggestions?
Diabetes,Type 2 newly diagnosed,"My husband was diagnosed 2 weeks ago. He is on Metformin 3 times a day, 500mg. My questions are...If he doesn't have carbs for a meal, can he not take a tablet?How long before and after a meal can you safely take a tablet?How often should he be checked out i.e. hba1c, eyes, feet?Thank you!"
Diabetes,Do I have Diabetes or Insulin Resistance or Hypoglycemia?,"I have been strangely hungry a lot lately. I am a 42yr old female. I have been since I was 15 or 14 skipping meals to maintain my weight so I can eat a lot at once. My dieting has varied from when I was a teenager and in my 20's I'd go for 4 days each day eating less than 500 calories to binge eat for 3 days during high school and college whatever and how much food I wanted. Then in 1999, for around 6 months I stopped, gained some(went from 94lbs to 106lbs at 5'0"" tall. Well I didn't like the way I looked, went back to some dieting from time to time. When I got married in 2002, had 1 or 2 days at least a week of eating less than 500 calories. I have had a few episodes over the years of low blood sugar at night had to eat some sugar, but it's all WORTH IT to NEVER EVER be fat, because for me, it's everything to look good. If you don't look good, you have nothing in this world. Everyone judges you on how you look whether it's your old high school friends or old boyfriends or getting a job to ever one day if your significant other dies or divorces that you had to go find someone new you would not look good to try to find someone it would be very difficult. So for me, looking good is the only thing that matters, the ONLY THING in life for me, so for me, even when I had the episodes once in a while(could be a few times in let's say 2 or 3 years) of low blood sugar, it was all worth it to not be fat. I only have had tingling hands when I had the low blood sugar episodes, which were always rare. I did have my heart obviously beat kind of fast whenever I would do a simple task like going to use the bathroom or taking a shower. The past around 5 years being doing 2 days a week less than 500 calories and 1 day a week around 850-900 calories. Weight loss of 5lbs a week(2lbs in one day weight loss for the 2 less than 500 calories) and 1 lb for the 850-900 calorie day. Now, can't seem to diet at all. I ate a large salad this past monday, which I was so hungry I ended up eating a 280 calorie bag of cookies after I felt I needed sugar. I am really worried that I have something wrong. My dad has type 2 diabetes since 1986, but he loss weight, I am GAINING weight(not much, but for me going from 98lbs to 101-102lbs is huge for me personally) and it is real weight since I have maintained this weight for since August. As I said, I am not fat or chunky as I am 5 feet zero inches tall and weigh around 101lbs. I have gotten my glucose test in July even and it was 87, which 110 is the most you can go to, so it's normal and the highest it was ever was 90. So I am not sure what's going on since I was getting hungrier even back in July when I got this tested. So I am not sure what is going on? Is it just perimenopause or is it insulin resistance or diabetes? The thing that dumbfounded about is that I have been skipping meals since a teenager, but have never had ANY problems and all of a sudden I have some extreme hunger at times,** but not losing weight** and have GAINED unlike my dad. I have had since my early 20's frequent urination so I can't say that's a symptom. I only have thirst issues if I have eaten something with a lot of salt and even when I have, most of the time I am not thirsty a lot, so that symptom you can't say I have either. So the only thing I have is that I am hungry more often than usual and sometimes it has been an extreme hunger. So I am not sure what is going on? Any thoughts? I am not sure if not eating has caused my issue or eating too much carbs and sugar or it's none of that at all? As I said, my glucose has been fine and even had a time of extreme hunger last August, they tested my glucose, it was 90. So I am not sure why I feel I am unable to do my diet days when before I could do it without issue that it wasn't that hard to live without much food in one day? For example, after a weekend of eating a lot, Mondays were easy, now I am extremely hungry even if I ate a lot on both Saturday and Sunday. I am kind of worried it could be diabetes and I don't know how it could be since even just a few weeks ago, I dieted less than 500 calories and I didn't go into low blood sugar episode or anything like that? So I am not sure why I am so freakin hungry? What could it be? Don't say too much carbs and sugar since I have eaten this way since my late teens early 20's, so why would I start something weird now all of a sudden?"
Diabetes,Has anyone or know of anyone who's been on a DAFNE course?,"Hi there,I've not posted on the diabetic section before so a bit of background.I'm based in the UK, female, 56 years old and have had Type 1 diabetes for the last 20 years.Last blood test (Aug 19) HbA1c IFCC reading was 90. It should be between 20 - 41 and my daily blood glucose readings range from anything between 9 and 26. My history is that my blood sugar is always too high. I was diagnosed with a blood sugar reading of 51.2.I have tried so hard - counting carbs, adjusting my insulin dosage, stopped drinking alcohol and to be honest I feel that I just can't do this anymore as nothing makes sense as I just don't understand, for example I'll go to bed with a blood reading of 13.7 and I'll wake up in the morning with a blood reading of 21.3 after having taken my normal dose of levemir the night before.So I am now booked onto a 5 day (40 hour) NHS DAFNE course (Dose Adjustment For Normal Eating) at my local hospital and I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed as to whether I am going to be able to take it all in!! It's intensive - 8 hours a day, so I'm just wondering if anyone has been on one or knows anyone who has, and how they found it? My consultant says it's life changing so I'm not sure why I've been left to struggle for years and years without going on one before. Anyway that's a different story!!I am feeling positive that this course will help me and my aim is to hopefully be considered for an insulin pump so I need to go on this course first.Any insights or advice would be much appreciated.Many thanks!!Claire xx"

Diabetes,insipidus symptons vs diabetes type 2,"I am always thirsty even when I drink and I often will go upto twenty times a day. The slightest sip of liquid can make me want to go.I've been like for this for twenty plus yrs, i am pre-diabetic which may explain the above(but only for a few years)Read about diabetes insipidus and most of the symptons mirror mine. One thing that caught my attention was that one of the supposed differences in symptons between diabetes insipidus and diabetes type 2 is that the urine is clear whereas someone with diabetes is supposed to pass cloudy dark urine.If I go say twenty times only about 3 have any color, the rest are as clear as water.Curious those with diabetes causing them to go a lot , how often do you go? 20 times a day normal? Do you find your urine isnt clear?"
Diabetes,Diabetes 1 + Depression + Alcohol/Antidepressants. Experience anyone?,"Hey,I have had depression since I got Diabetes 1, 15 years ago. During a point in my life, I was on Cymbalta for my Depression which helped me. But the withdrawal effects were difficult.I have also self-medicated with alcohol which has helped. But I realized it is not the way to go.The issue is that when I have a few glasses of beer my depression is gone. And when I was on Cymbalta antidepressants during 6 months I had never felt better. But since I quit Cymbalta for over 4 years ago. I have felt depressed. However natural medicine like meditation, diet and exercise has helped to cope with my Diabetes 1. But none as good as alcohol and antidepressants. However, I do not want to start taking antidepressants again due to side effects. And I do not want to drink alcohol.Anyone else has any similar experiences or stories with handling depression/anxiety caused by Diabetes 1 with alcohol or antidepressants?"

Diabetes,Doubt cast on diabetes assumptions,"A breakthrough discovery has cast doubt on previous assumptions that glucose is the main driving force behind chronic inflammation within type 2 diabetes.University of Kentucky researchers carried out a study to test whether glucose is the cause of chronic inflammation - previously it has been assumed that raised blood glucose levels is the cause.Their investigations indicate that an interaction between certain lipids (blood fats) and mitochondria (the powerhouse of cells in the body) appeared to be the problem.Blood glucose control is still important for managing type 2 diabetes, but the researchers state it may not be the key factor in the development of problems related to inflammation such as heart and kidney disease.Originally the researchers had set out to prove another theory: that immune cells from people with type 2 diabetes would produce energy by burning glucose.""We were wrong,"" said Barbara Nikolajczyk, from the UK Barnstable Brown Diabetes Center, Department of Pharmacology and Nutritional Sciences, who co-led the study.The researchers found instead that energy from glucose was not driving chronic inflammation, but rather it was a combination of defects in mitochondria and an increase in fat derivatives that were responsible.""Our data provide an explanation for why people with tight glucose control can nonetheless have disease progression.""Nikolajczyk and colleagues now plan to precisely identify which types of fatty derivatives are linked with inflammation and to investigate associations between lipids and insulin resistance"
Diabetes,How to manage Dexamethsone for Chemotherapy with Diabetes?,"I have just started a 6 month chemotherapy course and I have been prescribed Dexamethasone, a type of steroid tablet to help with anti-sickness, for 3 days after each chemo cycle (every 2 weeks). However, i have also been diagnosed with type-2 diabetes for which i take insulin everyday to stabilise my blood sugar. Since taking the steroid tablets, i noticed my blood sugar levels begin to rise very high making it difficult to manage. I have spoken with my doctor about this who said not to worry and just adjust my insulin intake per day. However, i'm still not able to easily keep my sugar levels down and this worries me slightly. If anyone has any suggestions regarding this or has been in a similar situation, I would greatly appreciate any advice.Many thanks"
Diabetes,Type 2 diabetes mmol/l goes up and down ,I've been on Mylan Metaform 850mg twice a day with Austell-Glimepride 2mg in the morning. My mmol/l in the morning is 6.4 and after eating 7.5. But when it is almost lunch time I test my levels and itbis back to 6. After 10 minutes it drops to 4.7 to 3.5. Why does it fluctuate like e that? Afternoons it will go to 8.3 mmol/l.
Diabetes,Insulin absorption issues,So I have noticed over the past two months that there will be a few days at a time when my blood sugar is consistently high no matter what I do. I can be eating low or no carbs and take a small amount of insulin and it remains high. Even when I go to make a correction it still does nothing. Is there an absorption issue that may be present? Do I need a new brand of Insulin? I am a type one diabetic and have been living with the disease for 12 years. I currently use the Novolog flex pen and have not had these issues before. Any help or suggestions much appreciated.

Diabetes,Farxiga for T2 Diabetes,"Does anyone take Farxiga? I could not tolerate Metformin, so my doctor changed my medication to Farxiga a couple of months ago. It has lowered my AlC and I've lost 20 pounds, as it's thought that Farxiga causes weight loss because it sends extra glucose (sugar) from your blood into your urine; however, I'm concerned as people who took Farxiga in clinical studies were five times more likely to develop bladder cancer than people who took another diabetes drug."

Diabetes,Dizziness ,"Hello all,New member here. I just got back from the doctors after requesting an EKG due to my mother passing in her sleep in December 2015 at just 45 years old and my aunt (her sister) dropping suddenly from cardiac arrest while waiting in line for coffee at a casino in Niagara Falls. Luckily one of the young women working behind the counter just graduated medical school and was able to perform CPR until paramedics arrived which saved her life. She had a pacemaker put in and is still kicking. She was 38 when this happened. I am turning 31 on July 6th and lately out of blue I have been having weird chest symptoms like chest tightness, trouble getting a full breath, feeling lightheaded. My EKG came back completely normal which is a huge sigh of relief although I still do experience the lightheadedness just not as extreme as it was. All the symptoms started beginning of May out of the blue for no reason at all. My blood test came back amazing a few weeks ago which my doctor is thrilled about. He is saying all my symptoms have to do with anxiety due to getting older and the family history with the heart. I am type 2 for about 10 years and only earlier this year did I get my eating under control and cut out junk food and pretty much all unhealthy carbs. My trig’s went from 333 to 76 which is amazing and my A1C went from 12.6 to 8.8. I am currently living in Phoenix, AZ since 2013 and am going back home to Buffalo,NY on Saturday till the end of July. I was considering having a stress test when I return. Do you think I need one or is the EKG enough. I’m trying to better myself but can’t seem to calm down my health anxiety. Thanks so much!"

Diabetes,Consultant problem,"New to this forum!I recently saw a different consultant at my diabetes review, and felt so upset about the visit it reduced me to tears when speaking to the receptionist. A little bit of background information, for many years I have struggled and have had very high blood sugar readings and Hba1c over 100. I had been seeing a doctor I liked and she had tried many different techniques and medications, all of which worked for about 3 months and then the same problems would occur. The main issues began when she unfortunately fell ill, and my appointments started to be cancelled or postponed, I was seeing a different doctor every time (if I ever got an appointment) and nothing was being done to try and help me, as each appointment felt like a review of what I knew had been happening in the past years, and the blame being shifted onto me. The last consultation I had, I felt as though the doctor was judging me for my sub optimal control, and that I was entirely to blame for the situation I am in. I felt like a failure in something I already struggle with, and didn't want to talk about any of the issues I had planned to discuss. I became very short with my answers, I wanted to leave. I reported this to the receptionist, asking that I do not see this doctor again. At this point i began to cry and left, it is not like me to cry about things like this, but I feel that as healthcare professional, specialising in diabetic patients, his consulting style was appalling.Has anyone else felt like this before? I have never considered myself to be emotionally affected by my condition, however now I am beginning to feel there isn't much hope."
Diabetes,Worth Getting Tested?,"Hey,I am an eighteen year old male to begin with. I have had a rough health run recently, i went through a rough bout of a diarrheal disease which has mostly cleared up now for 6 months which in turn triggered an autoimmune disease in my thyroid and then after both of those i was deficient in multiple vitamins and developed chronic fatigue syndrome.I was looking through my blood tests and medical record the other day and realized i have never been checked for diabetes.It is not something that runs in the family but i will elaborate on why this prompted suspicion; for a long time there i was getting yeast infections, the doctor said it was most likely due to the fact my immune system was down from chronic disease. It would always come back despite me being perfectly hygienic. I went through weight loss most likely due to the diarrhea however i am eating 1.5x the recommended caloric intake or around eleven thousand kilojoules to increase weight and it has taken me 8 months to gain 9kg and i lose weight extremely quickly. I had a long time there where i was constantly thirsty. My vision would often randomly blur up and i often had minor urinary problems, mostly being the constant need to pee especially at night.Of course all of that has the whole fatigue thing chucked on top, which is where i got the chronic fatigue diagnosis due to the severe fatigue despite no immediate cause. One of the biggest influences on my energy levels is my food, which is really strange, i miss a meal and i just crash for the rest of the day.My fatigue has been unchanging despite following a therapy routine for chronic fatigue and i was wondering if maybe diabetes could have fallen in somewhere while everything else was happening and that is inhibiting my recovery? I most likely do have chronic fatigue due to the long run with chronic disease however it refuses change."
Diabetes,Metformin,Does anyone know if there is an alternative to Metformin. I really can't be doing with this constant diarrhea. Mostly just liquid stools. It's embarrassing especially at work with no prior warning.
Diabetes,Trouble sleeping after eating sugary foods,"Hi,I am 50 years old and used (till 2 months ago) to eat lots of confectionary and often woke at 2am and couldnt sleep till get-up time at 5:30am to get up for work.This improved when i cut down on sweet foods, and i can sleep more now.(i do not take any 'official' diabetes treatments)Strangely, i have found that if i eat a raw spring onion before going to bed, then it helps me to sleep better.Also, if i do wake at 2am, and cant get back to sleep, then i now get up and eat half a raw spring onion, and it helps ne get back to sleep.Why is this?Are there any other foods which help sleeping?(i eat the raw spring onion with a little bit of chees so as to help me ""get it down"".)"

Diabetes,Diabetes Big issue,"Now a days diabetes is a big issue A standout amongst the most well-known medical problems that faces individuals with separate diabetes is poor blood dissemination. This is the reason numerous diabetics have issues with limbs, for example, feet, toes and even their legs. Poor blood course disallows the appendages from get the best possible measure of oxygenated blood. This can prompt nerve harm and disease. Commonly, because of the nerve harm, diabetics will no know there is a contamination until it is past the point of no return.Due to the disjoin absence of blood dissemination in diabetic it is essential that they deal with their feet. There might be an approach to do this. Diabetic socks are extraordinarily made in view of diabetics. These socks have not been demonstrated to keep any of the issues related with diabetes and can not fix any of issues that may accompany diabetes. They are, in any case, made to address some basic diabetic issues.For more details about diabetes diet and control suppliments please visit this website"
Diabetes,Type one diabetes and Anxiety,I have been a type one diabetic for 11 years. I was recently diagnosed with anxiety this past November after two hospital visits and many tests.

Diabetes,Type 2 Diabetes and Potassium.,"I have tried multiple natural treatments for my type 2 diabetes since I was diagnosed in 2015. Some have worked well for a while but eventually stop working. My latest trial was kelp and dark green vegetable juicing. That gave me good results, but juicing takes a lot of time and is messy, so I wanted to find out what is in these vegetables that is helping. It appears to be potassium. Almost everyone is low on potassium and it is very difficult to get the recommended amount of 3000 to 4000mg per day. For that last few days I have gotten good results from taking 2 potassium supplements with every meal that is not vegetables. Each tablet or capsule is only 99mg so it would take alot to get up to the min daily requirement. But it is still helping. I always take it with food to avoid stomach upset, which is common with potassium. I have 4 different potassium supplements so I don't depend on any one supplement. One is just powdered kelp.I also noticed that some blood pressure medications are potassium based. Modern diets are full of high sodium ""foods."" Is it possible that by this high sodium diet we are causing diabetes ? I also try to use sea salt whenever I add salt. It has potassium in it. Table salt has only sodium chloride. Preserved foods have the same or sodium nitrate.Has anyone else tried adding this supplement to their diet to treat type 2 diabetes?"
Diabetes,GP is halving my Metformin.,"I was diagnosed type 2, 3 years ago with an HbA1c of 60. ( 7.6% ).I was prescribed Metformin, 1000mg a day, taken 500 mg at breakfast and 500 mg at dinner.Since 2016, by paring carbs to the bone and exercising, it steadily fell to 41 ( 5.9%) at my blood test last December.The nurse said I should reduce the Metformin to 500mg, taken with dinner. I wasn't keen, so since January I have been cutting my 500mg tablet in half at breakfast and taking 500mg at dinner. So I have been having three quarters of what I took for 3 years. ie 750mg.My last blood test, last week, showed that my HbA1c has gone up to 42 (6%). An increase of 1 or .1% in 3 months.Now my GP has said I must only take 500mg a day. As my levels rose in 3 months by reducing my dose by a quarter, I am expecting that reducing the dose to half, they will rise further.My question is, isn't it better to be as close to a ""normal"" level as possible? Why does it seem that I am being punished for all my dedicated efforts?"

Due to me being overweight and having low activity levels I was concerned about type 2 Diabeties do went to mu doctor and had a hba1c test done - my number was 32 so my doctor said that was fine (i didnt mention my funny episodes to him at this time)once i knew i wasnt diabetic or pre diabetic i was trying to find out what my symptoms were and kept coming acriss things to do with low blood sugar so i bought myself a glucose monitor and test strips so when i did feel funny i could check myself.i found that when i was feeling horrible my blood sugar was around 3.4 - 3.7 and the rest of the day it hovers around 6-7.Im only having lows between my breakfast and lunch - this seems to be regardless of what i eat for breakfast but i am becoming so anxious about having a 'hypo' that i an eating more than i need to try and keep my blood sugar up (this is even more problematic when trying to lose wight)Everything i read online seems to be if you are overweight and dont exercise then your blood sugar would typically be high but i seem to be the opposite and this is making me nervous about what could be the cause?Has anyone else experienced this? Should i be worried or just buy some dextrose tablets and deal with the hypos when they happen?Thanks!"
Diabetes,Shaking and palpitation,"I am a diabetic patient. I had hypoglycemic event in 2009 due to skipping meal or taking more diamicron than needed. Lastly very small dose of diamicron also making my body shaking though sugar was not low. Doctor understood after two months and stopped diamicron. I started eating mostly vegetables and very little carb every three hours and started feeling better within 4 months. Any way for controlling sugar I had to take insulin. But last year due to physical labour sugar became unbalanced, made me shaking and having palpitation. I improved in three months. But this time I had to take Ciproxacilin antibiotics due to prostate infection and I started shaking again. I am having palpitation again. Heart specialist did stress test, and says it is diabatic problem. I used to take 27+7 unit of levemir night and day and 9 unit humalog each time I eat. Sugar started dropping quickly. I was reducing levemir every night by one point, When I was taking 23 unit levemir at night, morning time sugar came to 4.9 , I was shaking too much. Now I am taking 16 +3unit levemir night and day. Still sugar tends to go below 6 at 12noon and 3pm. Though sugar 5mmol is not low, but I do not feel good. I feel hypo feeling and palpitation. I am taking Dutesteride for prostate, but it will take a year to fix. But it is not giving me that much problem. In general sugar position is not that bad, but I have all the time hypo feeling, pressure on the head and eyes. I am eating swiss chard & Okra vegetables for magnesium. Please help me"
Diabetes,Low sugar or something else?,"So I get pretty bad suagr crashes, or at least I think that's what they are... they happen sometimes, not always. I have a diagnosis of hypoglycemia from a functional medical doctor who ran some bloodwork, but the bad crashes happen usually when I start to diet or go low carb or go on my treadmill...my whole body wants to shut down and I have internal vibrations and all that, cold and hot at the same time and I sweat a lot...I feel better once I take more sugar and food and stuff but I feel SO off for the next few days- better and not like I will pass out but just off and like I want to sleep all the time and like my body just wants to shut off and I get sort of depressed I think? It's not just I feel phsyically off, but I feel off mentally and not like myself at all and things around me even feel off too ...and wondering why this is and why I am not just bouncing back if I take sugar. Are these true sugar crashes or something else? thanks!"

Diabetes,Need advise on exercise,"HiNewly diagnosed yesterday with a reading of 46 in the 42-47 range. So I spent yesterday researching after reading the little booklet. I've got a handle on the diet/losing weight, I think, as I had joined WeightWatchers recently, and now need to tailor my meals to monitor carbs more closely, increase good veggies and cut out all bad treats/snacks even if I have the points! But my question is about exercise and I would welcome any suggestions. My problem is I can't stand for more than a few minutes or walk more than a few metres without crutches/stick, as I have a twisted pelvis, crumbled discs, hip erosion and osteoarthritis. So walking is not an option for me. I used to power walk 5 miles, 5 times a week but had to stop 2 years ago due to the back problems. I'm also miles from the nearest swimming pool and it's very expensive for a pensioner like me, both for the entrance and petrol costs. I certainly couldn't afford it 5 times a week as has been suggested.I see the Nurse Adviser at my GP practice next month with 4 weeks food monitoring records, but is there anything I can do to help myself in the meantime? Thanks everyone.HiNewly diagnosed yesterday with a reading of 46 in the 42-47 range. So I spent yesterday researching after reading the little booklet.

Diabetes,Dyslipidimia,"I am a diabetic, type 1, 37 years old and over weight. I have been a diabetic for 36 years now. I understand that doctors may want you to take meds that you may not need for their initial use but to help with other things. My cholesterol numbers are actually very good and my doctor has been telling me that he was going to put me on cholesterol meds, I refused the meds because my numbers are good and I did not want to be taking meds just for the sake of taking them. He says that I am more prone to stroke and heart attack because of my illness, which I understand. I still am not comfortable taking cholesterol meds just for preventative care, so again, I refused until I am in more need of the meds. He later diagnosed me with dyslipidimia which is a cholesterol disorder, knowing I do mot have this condition, in my mind just to push me to take these meds. I am wondering if this is legal, can he diagnose me with a disorder he knows I do not have in order to push his want for me to take these meds? Any insight would be much appreciated."

Mine seem to be rising?Also, I have just been to see the doctor today because I haven't felt well for a few months, and after describing my symptoms, he thinks I may be suffering from pancreatitis (acute or chronic) and is referring me for a scan.

Diabetes,Bit anxious about it all,Hi sorry for all the questions I’m about to ask. I’m 29 years old borderline obese and my last blood test came back normal for blood sugar I believe it was 5 (something) whereas before it was 5.6 which doesn’t make sense to me as I didn’t make any improvement. Also my total cholesterol and triglycerides were both slightly elevated both times. I’m really worried about developing diabetes or having heart attack one day. My diet is quite poor I think. I eat quite averagely a lot. I have a fair amount of carbs on most days like bread pasta or rice. 2 days of the weeks I find myself ordering a pizza takeaway I’ve tried so many times to stop them but now I’m starting to think it’s just an addiction. It used to be once a week but after stopping them and going Keto for a while I fell off the bandwagon and started ordering more. As I say my blood sugar was normal last time. Is this really bad what I’m doing? I eat maybe 2-3 portions of veg a day on average. But probably 25% of my calories is coming from pizza atm. I feel so guilty every time I order. Does blood sugar get worse with age? If not then how does prediabetes turn into diabetes? If my bloods are normal but I’m overweight do I have anything to worry about? Many thanks in advance 
Diabetes,Just started testing my glucose levels and feel lost,"My doctor just got me going on testing my blood glucose 2-3 times a day, as of yesterday. We really didn't talk about it, I found out all this online through my patient portal on my doc's website. Having a hard time waiting to get answers from her so came here.Questions-Last night after eating a healthy dinner, number was 127, which I understand is good. This morning after fasting and before drinking any coffee or anything, number was 99. I had an early lunch followed by a bowl of ice cream, checked glucose after about 1 1/2 hours, number was 105. Is that good? Bad? Indifferent? I thought it was weird after eating sugar. Also, I feel so bad after eating sugar- right now I feel weak, tired, have a headache, yet my glucose looks fine? Can just a few times testing even really show anything? I'm just really confused about this entire process I guess. Can anyone help me out?"
Diabetes,How he cured his own diabetes - experience of a Buddhist Master,"Hi all,I chance upon this article in Vietnamese, regarding a method named CORA, that claims to treat diabetes. Many followers and supporters of the method, mostly Buddhists and vegetarian, also say that they've reduced the blood sugar level to healthy range within just 2-3 weeks.If this method really works, I think it should be translated to English to help more people. So here goes.1. What is Diabetes?Diabetes is a metabolic disease where the amount of glucose in your blood is too high. This is because your pancreas doesn’t produce any insulin, or not enough insulin, to help glucose enter your body’s cells – or the insulin that is produced does not work properly (known as insulin resistance).When this just happens, the early symptoms include frequent urination and most likely at night. Thus, you’ll feel very thirsty and exhausted.If this continues, because your cells don't get the glucose they need for energy, your body begins to burn fat for energy, which produces ketones. The buildup of ketones will make your blood acidic, which results in the malfunction of your organs. Diabetes, therefore, is one of the main culprits that lead to stroke, kidney failure, heart attack, blindness, etc.2. How does our body convert Carbohydrate?As we all know, our body needs energy, which is calculated in calorie. Calorie comes from multiple sources like protein and fat. But the main source is still carbohydrate.When we eat rice, noodles or pizza, etc. the digestive system will break them down to sugar, which is then absorbed into our blood and transported to the cells. However, cells are enclosed inside the membrane. Not everything can go through it. That’s why we need insulin from an organ named pancreas.The insulin will prompt cells to absorb blood sugar for energy or storage. And so, when we just finish eating, the blood sugar level is very high. But thanks to this hormone, after around 2 hours, it will return to normal level of 80 mg/dl. This is when our system detects and signals that we’re hungry.[img]https://patient.azureedge.net/forums/images/upload-sm/896847-80f1f402-ade3-4f9f-89a9-4f73ddd850e6.jpg[/img]The common way to treat diabetes is to cut down on carbohydrate.3. What happens when the pancreas is weakened?In a healthy body, when blood sugar reaches 80-90 mg/dl, insulin will start to be released. But when the pancreas is weakened, it can no longer measure the blood sugar precisely. So it will only release insulin when blood sugar is up to 120-130 mg/dl or even worse, 160-170 mg/dl. In addition, a weakened pancreas cannot release enough insulin either. Both will lead to high blood sugar, and at the same time, cells starving for energy.When cells don’t have enough energy, they send a signal to our brain, making us always hungry. But the more we eat, the sooner we’ll die. Because more sugar will get stuck in the blood with nowhere to release to.4. Why is the pancreas weakened?The main reasons can be listed as:- Redundancy of protein, including both animal and plant protein.- Redundancy of fat, from both animal or plant.- Redundancy of sugar, either sucrose or fructose.- Spices like MSG, curry powder, five-spice powder,...- Soft drinks, alcohol.- Decrease of sex hormones (testosterone and estrogen)Here let us focus on the decrease of sex hormones.Testosterone in men and estrogen in women have the ability to nourish our internal organs, including the pancreas, heart, liver, kidney… This has long been discovered in Eastern Medicine (known as Kidney jing or Kidney essence).So where do testosterone and estrogen come from? The former is secreted mainly from the testes while the later is produced primarily by the ovaries. So when people are having sex, the corresponding organs will be occupied with generating sperms and eggs, instead of testosterone and estrogen.As a result, if someone is having an immoderate sex life, the testosterone and estrogen levels won’t be enough to protect his / her organs.5. The CORA method[img]https://patient.azureedge.net/forums/images/upload-sm/896847-aff1dc6e-a53a-4658-b37b-59df8b9131e3.jpg[/img]In CORA method, the patients can still eat rice, but only rice, vegetables and soya sauce.The CORA method provides a new perspective, that carbohydrate is not the main culprit. It’s the weakening of pancreas that fails to process carbohydrate and results in diabetes.So in the CORA method, patients can still eat rice, even a lot of rice. But they must have only rice with vegetables and soya sauce.When not pressured with other things like protein, fat, spices and alcohol, the pancreas will have a chance to recover. In addition, vegetables, specifically water spinach, can help pancreas recover quickly.[img]https://patient.azureedge.net/forums/images/upload-sm/896847-4ee0f4a0-deea-4f0d-8538-9b0994199224.jpg[/img]Water spinach helps pancreas recover quicklyBecause patients are allowed to eat lots of rice, he won’t feel very tired (a common symptom in diabetes due to loss of energy)When applying this method, patient should measure his blood sugar level regularly, eg. by a portable device. When the level drops below 95 mg/dl then he can add little bit of protein and fat in the diet. But absolutely no soft drinks or alcohol.Depends on each individual, some people only take 2 days till the sugar level drops, while the others might take 5-10 days.[img]https://patient.azureedge.net/forums/images/upload-sm/896847-a44f99d9-7be9-4127-97d9-f18d2adc17f9.jpg[/img]Master Thich Chan Quang used to have diabetes and he has recovered using CORA method.6. In conclusionMost of the diseases we have, are signals that we have done something wrong with our body. So to achieve health and wellness, it is critical to adapt a healthy lifestyle and practice Qi Gong.Qi Gong is an invisible force that enhance the vitality of our whole body. Though not yet recognized in the West, for a long time it has been utilized in Eastern Medicine as well as Martial Arts. With Qi Gong, human can perform extraordinary feats that science still cannot explain.The Asians have small bodies. So in thousands of years struggling with nature, our ancestors have found Qi Gong as a way to supplement the lack of physique. If practised correctly, it’ll help protect our internal organs (including the pancreas).Besides, by leading a healthy lifestyle (both physical and mental wellness), we avoid being obsessed with desires or material possession. It’s also a good way to prevent illness.Finally, about the name CORA, Master only smiled and said: “CORA is just the abbreviation of COm & RAu (Rice and Vegetables in Vietnamese). Stop overthinking everything."

Diabetes,Help me understand my hypoglycaemic symptoms,"Hi everyone,Firstly a few things about me:- I'm 22 years old- Genetically fast metabolism- Have chronic fatigue syndrome- Not diabetic as far as I knowFor my whole life I've needed to eat hi-carb meals roughly every 2 hours or I get headaches, feel cold, very tired, nauseous and lightheaded. I consistently feel terrible when I wake up in the morning (which has always been the case, it's not just the CFS though that's made it worse) and if I fast for too long I get so nauseous I need to take medication before I feel well enough to eat.I always thought these symptoms were due to hypoglycaemia so I recently got a blood glucose test kit. I did my first reading this morning. Here's a timeline:10am: woke up with the beginnings of a headache, hunger and fatigue10:15am: ate 2 wholegrain muesli bars (not a lot of calories in these)10:30am: went back to sleep1:20pm: woke up with really bad headache, brain fog and fatigue1:30pm: did the glucose testMy result was 4.5mmol/L, which according to everything I've read on the internet so far, seems to be a normal, non-hypoglycaemic reading. This is confusing given how sick I was feeling, and especially the fact that I'm starting to feel better now that I'm eating a whole tin of butter beans fried with brussel sprouts and spinach on buttered toast. If it wasn't for the improvement with eating I'd assume it was all just caused by CFS.Is there an alternative explanation for these symptoms? Is my blood glucose meter wrong? Or is my baseline normal glucose level just different to most people's?"

Diabetes,Do I have diabetes?,"Hi there,So I’m 28 years old at a healthy weight, however, over the past 5-6 weeks I’ve noticed a change in my health. First I noticed my eyes were blood shot and my vision seemed slightly blurred. After the first week I noticed I was tired, which seemed like all the time. I started eating very healthy for a couple weeks and noticed I had more energy and eyes were back to normal. Then I stopped caring about what I ate and drank again, which resulted in blood shot eyes, blurry vision and loss of energy. I notice the most dramatic change with my eyes and energy about 20 to 40 minutes after I eat, it seems like. I eat my first meal later in the day between 12-1. My energy levels get so bad, I need to take a nap, soon after the symptoms come on. It doesn’t matter what time of day.Is this diabetes or some time of blood sugar level problems?Thank you."
Diabetes,Please help.,"Hello everyone, this is my first post in this forum so I hope I can get the help I really need. My mum has type 2 diabetes and is on medication and, I think, my dad has pre diabetes too but I’m not too sure. I’m a 21 year old guy who is been training and going to gym for over 3 years and for the past two years I have been eating a lot less than my TDEE but I also ate a lot carbs but I never went below 18% body fat and this is really frustrating me but I actually know a lot of people that went to gym and in 6/12 months dropped their body fat percentage to about 10/12% so I went to get my blood tests done and my doctor said that I don’t have pre diabetes or diabetes but thank to Dr. Google and Dr. YouTube, I’m 100% sure I have insulin resistance because both my parents only have fat around the midsection and very skinny arms, legs and necks, with no fat at all in those places and exactly the same happened with me and I also found out that a normal diabetes test doesn’t say if you are insulin resistant or not. Even if I lose weight overall, the midsection doesn’t decrease unless I eat very low carbs but with the same calorie deficit, which I did for about 3 weeks and the fat from the midsection started melting away but I had to give it up because it made me feel very weak and depressed plus I do a very physical job and I need to be strong which is something that a diet high in carbs and sugar gives me but having high body fat percentages is giving major depression because I really hate the way I look. People, please help me, is there a medication I can take to decrease the insulin resistance? I’m willing to start a low carb diet again and take medication that lowers insulin resistance at the same time and slowly increase the amount of carbs I eat, until I hit the point where I don’t get into the fat gaining mode so that I can still lose fat around the midsection, reach low body fat percentages, have some carbs and be able to go to work.Thank you for taking the time to read the post.Sam."
Diabetes,Diet advice in China,"I am teaching in China. Any advice on keeping to a good diet, especially keeping blood sugar levels (FBS) to normal levels ?

Diabetes,Itching ,"People of advanced ages suffer from itching problem due to loss of fat in the body. I read some where that when itching starts from lower part of legs, it is mostly due to lack of blood circulation. Regular walks are of course useful to increase blood circulation. Besides this has any one experienced such a problem and then successfully got over the itching problem? Various moisturizers are available but very few can rectify itching problem. I have been consulting skin Specialists but they are usually not in a position to help the elderly people much saying that it does occur in advanced ages due to loss of fat which at times can not get controlled."
Diabetes,Non-Diabetic Low Blood Sugar,"So.. all my life I have had episodes of low blood sugar, well, that's what we think but I've been tested twice after fasting for breakfast and both were negative (this was years ago). Lately i've been having more trouble, it happens 1-3 times a day and it comes with:- Sudden, extreme hunger- Nausea and stomach pain (alternating with the hunger)- Extreme fatigue and weakness (sometimes I cannot hold my head up)- Mild to severe shakiness- Sweating- Coldness- Tachycardia- Heart palpitations- Lightheadedness- DizzynessOn the worse episodes, I will experience all these symptoms at once and in full intensity. Other, more milder episodes are just the hunger, shakiness, and fatigue. The problem is that I have Gastroparesis so my stomach empties so slow that fasting and then blood tests is not effective in diagnosing hypoglycemia in me. My family and I are convinced that I suffer from non-diabetic hypoglycemia but we just need a different way of diagnosis, any suggestions? Will probably email my PCP over the weekend but not sure what to say...Current diagnosis:-Gastroparesis-GERD-Functional constipation-Tachycardia-POTS (in the middle of being diagnosed with)*This is not about diabetes but this was the closest forum I could find... plus many of my relatives have diabetes.Thanks"
Diabetes,Non-diabetic hypoglycemia ,"My blood sugar has been or feels like its been crashing for a few months now. About 8 months ago I had a really bad panic attack and ever since Ive been having anxiety and panic attacks regularly. Ive been through a very stressful period of my life. Along with this Ive also devolped some gut issues, as well as heartburn, gas and acid. My main concern right now, however, is if I go a few hours (say 4-5) my hands start shaking, I become lightheaded, sometimes it feels like im going to faint or die. Once I eat, it goes away. Im not diabetic, my doc did a diabetes test, and a c peptide test, and checked for pancreatic tumors, all clear. My blood glucose has come back at around 60-55, seems low to me and my doc agreed but no theories as to whats going on. Frankly, im scared this is going to kill me. Please does anyone know whats going on? I dont want to hear “carry candy” or “go see a doctor” I do and I have!! I just want theories as to the cause. Thank you in advance to any help."

Diabetes,A good trip to the endo!,"Let's start with the good news and the lessons learned: A1C of just 5.3, taken with a little finger-prick and a desktop device of some kind right in the office. Outstanding! This qualifies as ""normal"", although I have to (a) take metformin, (b) limit my diet, and (c) exercise like a fanatic, to keep it that way.The lesson learned is that, with my average pre-meal BG reading of about 95 (American) over the last ninety days, the question was always, well it's 95 before your meals, but what is it *after* your meals? Well, BG of 95 would come to an A1C of about 4.94, so my actual A1C of 5.3 is less than ten percent higher. Pretty darned OK.And, the endo himself just sits there with a silly smirk on his face. I'm not sure exactly what that means, but he says, ""You're making the diabetes go away."" He doesn't want to say, but I get the feeling he doesn't see this happen very often, not to this extent.The backstory is that this last January I showed up in my doctor's office very thirsty, he took some blood, then called me back two days later - and told me to go to the ER immediately! My BG and A1C were whoopee high. Pretty much out of the blue. They fixed me in the ER and admitted me for three days of observation. I didn't know what it all meant, but I guess they must have assumed I had appeared with LADA. I was sent home with both long-acting and short-acting insulin, and only the vaguest idea how to use them. A month later didn't need the insulin, but doctor was sure the metformin alone wouldn't do it so he put me on Jardiance as well. Two months later, running average pre-meal BG of about 85 I decided to try without the Jardiance and the endo just said, ""Sure, play with that"", his exact words.So, if you find yourself hospitalized for a few days with an out-of-the-blue BG and H1C reading of sky high - don't let it get you down, just maybe you can be as lucky as me.There's more to the story, and the story is ongoing, especially in the area of diet. And I know my good results are as much luck as anything. Those BG readings could easily have ended me in a month or two without treatment. The hospital stay and diagnosis were far from clear.

Diabetes,My diabetes insipidus journey,"I'm a 34 years old and was diagnosed with central diabetes insipidus in Sept 07. This diagnosis followed a prolonged headache (about 2 weeks) and fever (10 days) after which I became extremely thirsty and could hardly sleep for getting up in the night to go to the bathroom! Unfortunately the doctors have been unable to pinpoint the reason behind why I suddenly developed this rare illness, which I understand is likely to be permanent. I now take desmopressin nasal spray about twice a day. I continue to feel very tired and sleep 10 hours a night.I'd be very interested to hear from anyone else out there who has had a similar experience so we can compare notes and exchange coping tips! I'm fine when I have my spray with me, but am dreading the day when I forget it and am forced to return to the drink - pee - drink cycle."
Diabetes,More fructose ...,"OK so the basics, sucrose is table sugar, is a molecule of glucose tied to a molecule of fructose. We diabetics know all about glucose, right, it goes into the blood and is used by lots of cells as long as they have insulin. Fructose, as I've learned from web surfing the last few days, has to first be processed by the liver, it is generally NOT used directly by the cells, it does not require any insulin to get into the liver, only when it is converted and released as glucose. And if your liver (not pancreas) is behaving, well, then it doesn't release a ton of glucose for no reason.So the science on this - is not entirely settled. There is some disagreement, and some silliness. Many fruits (!) have more fructose NOT tied to glucose. And I can't believe that eating moderate amounts of fruit is in general a bad thing for normal humans, even normal humans with diabetes. And in general I've seen type2 diets are allowed some fruit, but no particular mention of high fructose or low fructose.(and if you Google this stuff what you mostly get is jabber about ""high fructose corn syrup"", which is a whole other discussion)So a couple of more thoughts about fructose, and I welcome any leads as to what else to even look at. When we count carbs in fruit and foods in general, should fructose carbs count the same as glucose carbs? What has me going on this is not really a fascination with organic chemistry, but some results I've seen in my own diet. Just by chance I settled on apples and watermelon as my fruit portions once or twice a day, as I was getting into all this. These turn out to be high fructose. And when I decided to try something else - my BG readings went up! So what I'm seeing is that counting high fructose food carbs may be misleading, or possibly even better, small amounts of fructose may *help* control BG symptoms. There do seem to be some sporadic suggests that this could be the case, but few specifics.And for extra credit, also consider - cinnamon. Now there are some reports that fructose can lead to higher triglycerides and belly fat. This sounds a little fishy to me, unless you try to live on fructose alone, but here's the thing, there are also reports that cinnamon cancels these effects. So, how about a little fructose plus cinnamon? Again in my own case, I was just by chance putting some cinnamon in my oatmeal, and when I stopped the oatmeal I stopped the cinnamon - and my BG went up. That's when I started seriously looking into it.So, anyone else have any knowledge, thoughts, recipes, stories? Thanks."

Diabetes,In need of help and support,"Good morning, Here I am sat in my car ready for what feels like it’s going to be a very long day at work.Ok here is my issue, exactly 12 months ago I started having strange feelings.- fatigue (feelings really tired)- Palpitation- Shakes- Feelinng sickThis was happening every few hours right up to the point where twice I almost passed out in public places and almost had to call for an ambulance.Since then I’ve been back and forth to the doctors. I told them I felt like I was having diabetes type symptoms. I’ve had blood tests taken for A1c (twice), Vitamin D, 24 hour ECG and I’ve been monitoring both my blood glucose and my blood pressure. Every time my blood sugars seem fine. Usually in the range of 5.0 and 7.5. Still i am no further than I was 12 months ago. This morning I got up and measured my blood glucose which read at 5.1. I could however feel the shakes starting to come on. After 15 minutes I was sat watching the TV feeling sick as ever. I was struggling to even get up to switch the TV over which was 8 feet away. I was shaking, feeling weak, sick, palpitations.I managed to get up and get some breakfast. I had a bowl of cereal and within 15 minutes or so. I felt normal again. I took a blood sugar reading and it was at 7.0.I got in the shower to get ready for work, had a mug of tea and helped my partner get my two children ready. I tested my self again an hour later and my sugars had dropped to 5.5 and I could feel the shakes starting again.Which brings me here. Sat in the car park outside work contemplating life. My doctors don’t know what’s wrong with me and I feel stuck. I certainly don’t have high blood sugars but I do feel like my symptoms are definitely how a diabetic would feel.This is really getting me down. I feel depressed as I feel like I’m struggling to control what ever this is. My doctors keep telling me my symptoms aren’t of what a diabetic would experience and hay my results don’t signify anything of that. My doctor th Via it could be “hypertension” which I think is rubbish and I do have an 24 hour blood pressure monitor to wear tomorrow. Any help and advice would be very much appreciated. "
Diabetes,Fructose versus glucose?!,"What can anybody tell me about fructose in the diet for type2 diabetes!?!I've run across this by accident. I bought what turned out to be a super-sweet variety of cantaloupe, and I thought OMG I shouldn't even be eating this, and then lo and behold, my BG *falls* ten points! Say, what?So through one thing and another I find there is some kind of issue about fructose in the diets for diabetes. And I'm guessing these melons are full of fructose.Fructose does NOT raise your BG reading, and in my case it seems to be doing the opposite! However nothing could be that good, right? So it turns out there are other drawbacks to too much fructose, it will raise your triglycerides. Which may in part explain why high-fructose corn syrup is a bad thing - low-fructose corn syrup being bad enough.So anyway, does anyone have anymore to add on or about this topic?Thanks!"

Diabetes,Experiencing hypoglycemic symptoms. Few questions???,"Hi,So lately I've been noticing a pattern of low blood sugar readings (3-4 hrs) after eating pancakes accompanied with syrup and a cup of vanilla latte coffee. I'm not sure why for the reason that syrup contains alot of sugar. I don't understand how my blood sugar would read low after a high sugar meal. If anyone does know this info and can share it with me that would be great! Also, I have experienced hypoglycemic symptoms for a while but wasn't sure that's what it was until recently when i curiously decided to check my blood sugar levels with my mother's machine and noticed that after eating two boiled eggs and drinking a cup of orange juice a few hours later I started feeling shaky, sweaty, and desperately weak. When I checked it I got a reading of 60 and then understood that all along even years before when I was pregnant with my son I experienced the same symptoms and didn't realize it could have been my blood sugar being low. From time to time I still experience the same symptoms. My mom was diagnosed with gestational diabetes when pregnant with me and it then later on developed to type 2 diabetes. So my question is:-Could the symptoms I'm experiencing be a sign of me being at risk of developing diabetes?-Is this something I should bring to my doctors attention immediately? Could it progressively get worse?Thank you in advance!!"
Diabetes,Diabetes type 2 and testosterone i ( women) ,"Hello, I have always had type 2 diabetes. We even tried taking insulin injections and it never lowered my diabetes levels. Now 1 year ago i took testosterone shots each month approx 1 shot. I noticed my daily blood glucose was down from 300-400 to 40 and 60... yes... I was eating chocolate like crazy... ( i hated chocolate before testosterone ) when i have lunch the maximum blood. Glucose goes up to 80. With insulin and glucophage treatmenet nothing happened... During testosterone period of 6 month my hba1c went down from 8.9 to 7.4 Now that i am off testosterone my diabetes is back and my health is miserable even if i dont eat anything!Why did testosterone help but not the medication. My doctors dont want me to take testosterone. But it was the only thing that made me better. Is there anything or other ways for this to be fixed... i am 30 years old. 1.65 cm and i weight 78kg "
Diabetes,Can diabetes insipidus cause weight gain?,"I was diagnosed with Central DI 30 years ago, but it likely onset as a result of a childhood head injury 50 years ago.

Diabetes,Hypo,"I'm getting more hypos these times.This evening before tea, I had a level of 13.8.

During that period, I didnt drink any water. I had forgotten to bring it with me. I ate about 30-40 rasberries and was sitting down on top of all that sugar. So at tea I still ate pasta. I injected 15 units of humalog mix 25/75. I went for a fast long walk. When I came back in, I felt ok but checked levels anyway. It was a good thing I did as it was 4.1. I was amazed how it had dropped so much. I ate more bread and soft cheese. Scary business. Now I think its ok. I'll know by how I feel.it usually starts in my thighs and leg area in general. I didnt experience that before I checked levels when I returned from walk. By checking my levels I think I got in ahead of it, the hypo that is. When I get a proper hypo, I always havent kept a check on levels so it comes on quickly as levels are probably at 3.0 or so making it very severe. So maybe I just beat a huge hypo this evening.I'm going to ask my doctor about this as I cant make out how levels came down so quickly. Sorry about long piece.

Diabetes,My Type 2 Diabetes story,"I’m sharing this because it may be useful to others. I am 54 year old male.About 2.5 years ago, my doctor diagnosed me as pre-diabetic (A1C = 6.4). He told me to lose weight. I did not. In fact I really did not take it seriously and made no changes. About 1 year ago (Summer 2017) he told me that my numbers were not good (A1C = 7.2) and he put me on Janumet (50/1000). I took the pills but made no other changes. I never took my own blood glucose measurements. In January 2018 my A1C was 7.9 and he threatened me with taking injectables. I was also starting to feel peripheral neuropathy in my feet. That got my attention. At the time I weighed 270 pounds and was an avid power lifter in the gym regularly bench pressing 405 pounds and going to the gym 3-4 days per week. I had no dietary considerations at all and was probably around 3000-4000 calories per day. The diagnosis and threat of having to inject myself provided great motivation.I doubled up on the Janumet going to two 50/1000 tablets per day. This made me have to take daily Imodium because my stomach could not handle it. I started running/walking in addition to lifting. I dramatically altered my diet to drop calories (initially to about 1200/day), spaced meals to 5-6 smaller feeds per day, increased certain vegetables, and dramatically cut back on carbs. I eliminated sugars as much as possible. And I drank more water. I also started taking Blood Glucose measurements 5-7 times per day. I read a lot and joined several diabetic discussion boards.In the first 3 months I lost about 40 pounds and improved my overall cardiovascular fitness. I started running local races for motivation. My self BG numbers dropped quickly. I kept lifting weights but my emphasis shifted to running. At this point I was actually RUNNING as opposed to jogging. My next A1C taken in early April was 5.0.In the next three months I continued my diet and exercise regimen but started re-introducing a small amount of carbs. My running caused me to lose an additional 20 pounds. As of today I am at around 205lbs. I run a lot, now averaging 40 miles per week and I race when I can. I have run all sorts of races including half marathons. Running is absolutely necessary for me to keep my BG numbers in check. When I don't run they creep up. I still lift in the gym but far less weight. I still watch my diet very closely especially to avoid (not eliminate) carbs, but my total caloric intake is up somewhat by design. The peripheral neuropathy has reduced a lot. My A1C in early July was 5.2. I am now off most meds including blood pressure meds that I used to take. I still take 500mg metformin per day but as a taper. If my BG numbers stay good – they have so far - I will be off all diabetic medications by the end of July.I am aware that Diabetes will not go away. I am aware that if I go back to my previous lifestyle it will resurface. But I am managing it. The bottom line is that lifestyle change (diet and exercise modification), meds, and self-testing have had a HUGE impact. I know that not everyone is the same. But I hope that my story can help some people."
Diabetes,diabetes insipidus,Hi AllI am now 39 years old and at the age of 36 was diagnosed with Diabetes insipidus. I am employed as a diabetes specialist nurse and had never even heard of diabetes insipidus and felt so very silly. I felt exhausted at the time as was drinking approx 6-8 liters a day and passing the same in urine. I was constantly on the toliet day and night hence I was getting no sleep and trying to continue to go to work.I visited my GP whom was at a loss and arranged routine blood test ie glucose levels at this time it was a colleague whom mentioned diabetes insipidus and when I read more about this it fitted exactly how I was feeling. I returned to my GP whom arranged the appropriate tests and within 24 hours I was admitted to hospital.In hospital my condition deteriated and we remain unsure why this was and no cause has ever been established for my diabetes insipidus. The results from my MRI scan did indicate substantial inflammation of the pituary gland but as to why is a loss this has since subsided without treatment for this. I have had a variety of tests and continue to be monitored very carefully and can not fault the care I recieved.I know it is a very rare condition and would live to hear from anyone whom also has diabetes insipidus and there experiences. I was initally prescribed Desmopressin spray twicw daily but this remianed difficult to control my hydration levels and over a year ago my cosultant changed me to the tablets and these have completley changed my life for the better and I believe my diabetes insipidus is far better controlled from these. However GPs do remain reluctant to prescribe these due to cost although my GP has been excellent.
Diabetes,HbA1c Figures and reducing/tapering Prednisolone ,"I'm posting on behalf of husband (he's not good on computer or keyboard) and we also look for info on the Polymyalgia Rheumatica forum.July 12th he was admitted to Rapid Assessment [u]U[/u]nit ater Gp appointmnet ans blood test results - diagnosis PMR + GCA. He was in for 3 days and saw ""hordes"" of Drs etc.Prednisolone was prescribed while he was there and a blood test just prior to discharge showed raised blood glucose (don't know what level he didn't ask and wanted to get out!) and Gliclazide 40mg daily was prescribed. He was advised to have ""random blood tests"" but our GP says they have moved to HbA1c at 3 monthly intervals.A sample was taken 4weeks after discharge and 40mg Prednisolone daily. So the 3 months covered by the test will be 2/3 prior to Pred and 1/3 after.He's now been asked to go to the Health Centre for 1/2 hour appointment with nurse re diabetic check/management.A PMR blood test result should be in shortly and he may well be told to start reducing the Pred (I gather this is the general procedure and likely to take several months at least). Hopefully this will result in gradually reducing blood glucose levels.Does anyone on this forum have any experience in this fieeld or should we just follow the PMR forum?apologies if post inappropriate)"

Diabetes,LCH Langerhan Cell Histiocytosis,"Hi allMy dauber was diagnosed with diabetes insipidus in January this year. The fact most people, including some medics, doesn’t help.She started on dissmopresson (sorry spelling?) and was fine for six weeks. However she started feeling worse, sickness, dizziness and chronic fatigue.She was admitted to hospital Monday this week. She’s had MRIs, scans, brain scans, numerous special blood tests, medics couldn’t find any reason.Thankfully her endocrinologist consultant saw her and said from the results of the tests, he was fairly certain she had Langerhan Cell Histiocytosis LCH. Need to have bronchoscopy and bone marrow tests to confirm the diagnosis. Apparently it’s very rare in a 29 year old adult.I just wondered if there was anyone who has LCH and could maybe share the effects of LCH.Thank you"

Diabetes,Do I have diabetes? if so what do I do about it?,"back in february I had my sugar level checked by my dr she said it was 100, from 70-99 that was with a 24 hour fast. I ordered a kit and some strips, I just got them in the mail last night. I checked my sugar level and it was 149, granted I did just eat 3 hours before and just finished drinking a cup and half of soda. Mind you I drink soda once a week the rest the time it is water only. I decided I will check my sugar level after 8 plus hours of fasting, so I ate dinner about 930 pm, so from 10pm to 830 am I had nothing to eat or drink and checked my blood sugar level 3 times, it registered as 101. at 430 am I checked it out of curiosity and it was a 106. So my question is, am I prediabetic? my dr said I wasn't and said it was fine when she checked it back in february and it was 100 with a 24 hour fast. so I dunno what to believe, everything I see online says I am prediabetic but the dr said I wasn't but the levels I get back show I am, so what do I believe and what can I do to lower my diabetes? I don't eat sugary stuff, I stay away from junk food, once a month I will get fast food and once a week a 20oz soda, the rest the time I am eating oatmeal no sugar, hotdogs with wheat bread no mustard or mayo or anything, eggs scrambled in the microwave no butter, ground beef, chicken, pork chops the chicken and pork chops baked in the oven with no seasonings, and boiled veggies. And when I run out of food, I eat top ramen so I can take my meds when I run out of money and food. but yet I am showing signs of prediabetic? Idk what to do. "

Diabetes,Help how to help a family member get the care needed and where they want to go.,"I need some advice my brother is hospitalized in a midwest rural county hospital. He is in a skilled unit with a plan to transfer him to a skilled nursing facility in 3 to 4 days once he meets a medicare requirement so Medicare will pay for the needed skilled nursing service. He is diabetic, has peripheral neuropathy, cerebral amoloyd angiopathy and has had strokes. The MRI he had on Monday which resulted in the hospitalization showed additional brain damage. I have concerns about him remaining at this hospital. This morning his blood sugar was 34 and then again this afternoon it hit 36 people interacting with him don't recognize his behavior as blood sugar related and waste time before checking it out. .. I'm worried that there is nothing in place in case this happens again. An original plan was for him to be hospitalized at a local hospital with a stroke center. He is also in need of diabetic care to stabilize blood sugars and he needs wound care. The current hospital has no expertise in these areas and don't even carry the aqua gel that he needs for current open wounds. When I asked about a transfer to a hospital with a stroke center I was told ""that should have happened yesterday."" He can't transfer now because Medicare won't pay for his hospital care. I'm worried he won't make it out alive. I guess I wonder who can be contacted to make sure he is getting the care he needs for all of the health issues. Should i call every 4 hours to see how he is and remind them to test his blood. ? Is there a way to push the issue of transfer to the hospital that will be taking over his care that is also a stroke center?"
Diabetes,Blood sugar levels,"I am confused.Type 2 diabetic diagnosed 2 years ago. On metformin not insulin.One of my neighbours is also diabetic type 2.She says he blood sugar is usually around 13.Mine is slightly high. If I take it first ting in the morning before having anything to eat or drink it is usually between 8 and 9. I think that is a little high.Trying to get myself back on track with it.I do not smoke but do drink alcohol. About 3 or 4 glasses of wine every week and occasionally a small glass of sherry, that is all.For the last 6 months my main problem has been that I have been underweight so have been trying to put on some weight which i am now doing. But putting on the weight has increased my blood sugar levels. Swings and roundabouts really a very difficult thing to balance. Now that I have gained the weight I will try and be a bit more careful what I eat and hope I can maintain the weight whilst reducing blood sugar levels a bit. Most people who are diabetic are overweight. Trust me to be different!!!Thanks for listening to my story.Sarah"

Diabetes,blood sugar and insomnia,"For almost 4 months now I've been experiencing on going night time symptoms where I'll wake up anywhere from 130am - 530am. Around 6am I can fall asleep again for another couple of hours. I've been recording all my waking up times and how I feel. My average waking up time at night is anywhere between 2am and 4am.Last few nights I've woken up between at like 2am - 3am after just one hour of sleep and can't get back to sleep, this is seriously frustrating. I don't feel hungry or having any cravings as such but I'll wake up feeling like I've just slept 7-8 hours! And then the weird thing is, is that I hardly ever even feel tired throughout the rest of the day. Makes no sense. So during the day time and waking hours I'm fine. Now I did hear that imbalanced blood sugar levels can cause these kind of erratic sleeping patterns and middle of the night insomnia where you'll awake at like 3am due to your BS levels crashing. Is this correct? I checked my blood sugar levels back in Jan after meals during the day and it was normal. I don't have any other symptoms really (although yesterday I was feeling a bit spaced out on and off)."

Diabetes,Type 1 diabetes constant high blood sugar,"So for the past week I have been struggling with my diabetes quite badly. For the first day I was struggling I had low blood sugars, that bad that I had a hypo for around 2 hours (around 2.6) and I was struggling to get it back up and I was also sick. Since then I was scared of my blood sugars getting that dangerously low again so I decreased my lantus (24 hr insulin) to make sure that it would happen again. I only did this for one night then I went back to my original units of lantus. but since then my blood sugars have been high and I can’t seem to control them. I have upped my lantus from 29units to 34 and my blood sugars are still reading around 16-21. I am giving myself extra insulin when I am eating also, nearlly double as much as I should usually take, but it’s taking a few hours to work and get into my system and then it still continues to be high.I really don’t know what to do and I’m really scared.I’ve tested my key tones and they are only 0.1 so nothing to worry about.Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Diabetes,Help! Acanthosis Nigricans,For the past couple of years I've always had a very dark neck and underarms. Recently I've decided to do something about it and found out it was acanthosis nigricans. I am not overweight or have diabetes. Also I am getting tested for insulin resistance and PCOS. I'm only 17 years old but as a child I had high cholesterol so could that be the reason why I have this condition. If anyone else has had it can you please tell me how you got rid of it and how long it took. ThanksFor the past couple of years I've always had a very dark neck and underarms.

Diabetes,My experiment: the order you eat your food can greatly reduce glucose spikes!,"Hello I am a MODY diabetic, diagnosed since I was a child, and with my sugar levels controlled only by diet.But I think this information can be useful for both type 1 and especially type 2 patients.I recently performed some experiments with my glucose meter and found something quite extraordinary.Let´s imagine 3 scenarios:A) I eat 50 grams of oats with water for breakfastB) I eat 50 grams of oats, but I add yogurt (protein), for breakfastC) I eat 50 grams of oats and yogurt, but I eat 5 blueberries or a bit (10ml) of orange juice 10-15mins before I eat the breakfast.If I only eat oats (A), my sugar spikes to around 10.5 (185))If I eat oats with yogurt (B), my sugar spikes to around 9.5 (170)If I eat a small portion of fruit (C) before same breakfast, my sugar spikes only to 8.5 (145)I repeated this experiment several times, and prickled my finger every 20min to follow the spike. I also repeated the same experiment but during lunch and dinner and the same effect was observed.What I have concluded?My pancreas is known to produce insulin but be lazy (after the high spikes, I get my glucose levels down to around 6 (110). So I assumed that my pancreas reaction is slow. I realized that I could trick it by triggering the production of insulin by just ingesting a very small portion of something sweet.Fruit that is not too sweet is ideal, because it´s safe to eat and also I am eating only a small amount. Also because the fructose gets quickly digested to glucose within minutes, it will quickly trigger the pancreas to start insulin production. Citrus are known to reduce spikes and they are also a great choice, but I found eating 5 blueberries a easy way to make it work.By doing this, I managed to keep my spikes much lower.The same effect is supported by also consuming protein together with the carbs, and during lunch I often eat the protein before the carbs too, and a salad too.I limit my carbs to about a max of 35 grams per meal and the spikes are relatively low. I eat absolutely no processed food and nothing with sugar or sweeteners (bananas are about the sweetest thing I eat). Please note that this experiment worked for me. It might not work for you but I think it can at least help many type 2 diabetics."
Diabetes,Prednisone induced diabetic,"I was diagnosed diabetic about 15 months ago. I had been on prednisone long term, about 18 months total. I have now been off the prednisone for about 5 or 6 weeks. I had expected the diabetes to go away when I quit the prednisone. I had been averaging morning readings of 94. When I went off the prednisone my readings are now higher, averaging about 105. I am and have been on 500 mg. Metformin twice a day. No change in eating. My docs explanation was age, 65. Seems very strange to me that the rise coincided with the lack of prednisone. My a1c is 5.5, that was about three weeks after quitting prednisone."

Diabetes,Amputation and bedsores due to diabetes,"My dad had a lower leg amputation but since his wound is not closing up, the doctor suggest a above knee amputation and he has done that too. Then later on he also had bedsores on his back. He undergoes few surgeries to get his leg amputated again and also remove dead flesh on his back (if I express it correctly).At the moment there is a hole on his back and his amputated leg, both are still not closing up. All the doctors and nurses did was scrap off his flesh from time to time, and the doctor just suggest another amputation again to even shorter his leg.Is there no other treatment rather than just keep amputating and removing his flesh if the wound isn't closing up? It is not like his wound is getting infected....What make it worst was his bedsores was caused by negligence by the hospital and the wound is becoming bigger and bigger due to the constant scraping off the flesh by the doctor..."
Diabetes,Blood sugar,I am Type 2 Diabetic and am on Metformin.I check my blood sugar about once a week.On Saturday evening In suddenly felt very thirsty and tired and wondered if this was a problem with my blood sugar. So I took my blood sugar and it was 24.9. It has never been that high before.I talked to a doctor on Out of Hours Service and he said if it had not gone down to 20 in the next hour I was to get myself to a doctor. By now it had started snowing quite hard and I did not have any transport! Fortunately my blood sugar did come down.My problem is that I am slightly underweight so am trying to put weight on but if I eat things that put weight on then my blood sugar rises.ANy bright ideas?Sarah?
Diabetes,"Problems with hypoglycaemia-like symptoms, but blood test normal","Hi all. My first post...After a period of not eating (perhaps waiting too long to have lunch or not eating enough during the day), I can have quite a serious reaction, becoming shaky, slightly dizzy, a feeling of hunger but also slight nausea, lethargy, slight increase in heart rate and sometimes difficulty concentrating or responding to people. Also - and the worst part for me - is a strange feeling of anxiety that accompanies this. I can think back to single incidents of this throughout adult life, which have generally been resolved by slowly eating a meal. A few months ago, I had a more prolonged reaction, which might have coincided with a virus. On this occasion, I had two more serious 'attacks' which were quite nasty and actually woke me up. A doctor diagnosed gastritis and gave anti-acids. I've not experienced any real stomach pain or painful reflux and suspect this wasn't a good diagnosis. A couple of months later, another more prolonged period of these symptoms (a few days). Since then, it has been up and down. I find that just one day of missing meals or waiting too long to eat is difficult to resolve by simply eating - symptoms persist between meals the following day, or even two or three days following. It's as if it takes days to 'reset' my system. I can be fine for several days. Exercise seems to help. I'm 39 and male. I've generally been in good shape, training capoeira for about 15 years, but an injury took me away from exercise last year and I've been putting on some extra weight - currently 15 stone (210 pounds) and 6'. I don't currently drive, so cycle or walk often. Sleep is generally ok. I'm often thirsty and drinks lots of water, but haven't been needing to urinate lots. Worse days can sometimes bring an upset stomach - er... 'loose stools'. My diet is generally good - lots of vegetables, fruit, some fish, little meat, cereals, pulses, beans, nuts. My weaknesses are cheese, bread and dark chocolate! Not great, but hardly terrible. Larger meals seem seem to help. Healthy snacking doesn't always seem to resolve symptoms on a difficult day. My GP took blood and returned all 'normal' results. My blood pressure is slightly low, but within the healthy range. I'm sympathetic to the time constraints within the UK healthcare system, but the GP did seem to be ruling out any obvious nasty stuff, then sending me on my way without being especially curious about how I'm feeling. I've always been somewhat cynical towards alternative treatments and like to see a good evidence base. I have friends or family members now suggesting all kinds of things, including acupuncture. I'm reading more about the links between the gut and mood and wonder if allergies or general 'gut health' may need to be looked at. But I can't link the symptoms to any particular foods - more an absence of enough food. My girlfriend and friends seem to be able to skip meals or live on relatively small meals - at worst, hunger is resolved by simple eating. It's puzzling and worrying that my system seems to be much different. Symptoms are starting to impact work, ability to travel and relationships. I understand the limits (and danger) of online advice and will return to my GP, but I'd be interested to hear from other with similar experiences or those with ideas. Many thanks and hope you're all feeling well today!Ben "

Diabetes,"Resetting the Pancreas, type 2 Diabetes","Has anyone heard of resetting the pancreas? The study involved mice that were bred to have diabetes type two. The researchers were able to get their pancreas to produce new Beta cells. They did this be modified fasting. I was diagnosed in May 2016.

I do take one Metformin per day, but I am concerned about going to two. My doctor keeps adding medications ""because I am diabetic' and am more at risk. I hate taking medications, they make me dizzy and give me headaches. So, I don't take them. I don't think conquering Diabetes is impossible.

Yogurt smoothie in the morning, 2 Breakfast of 2 eggs and 1 slice of bread or cottage cheese and fruit. 3 Nothing but water until dinner. Dinner is shrimp or chicken and a fresh big salad with many different vegetables, and only EV Organic olive oil and Balsamic vinegar.

Diabetes,Advice please. Can stress hove a higher reading in a non diabetic? ,"Hello.I suffer with Ibs which has been bad the past few weeks. The only way I get some relief is to take immodium! I've been getting yellow diarrhoea (sorry to gross you out). I've been extremely stressed and suffering with my anxiety the last few months.. I've been so tired which I've put down to the constant toilet issues. Yesterday before my tea I felt shaky and weak. I'd not been the loo in over 24 hours (no2) so wasn't tired due to that. I'd been very anxious all day though and had a panic attack. I decided to take my blood sugar as and was Suprised it was 6!this was before eating. I had my food then tested after 2 hours and it was 7.8. I don't know if this is normal for me. When I bought the monitor about a year ago I'm usually 5.4 before food but never tested after food as I was reassured by the reading. So my question is... Can stress in a non diabetic cause higher reading's? I've ran out of strips to test myself. I did test myself on my dad's this morning before food which read 6.3!!! I felt sick and nervous before taking it as I'm now stressing about having diabetes. My worry is that I have a problem with my pancreas with all the diarrhoea and tummy troubles I'm having. I had liver blood test about a month ago which were fine. The only real symptoms I have related to diabetes is tiredness and larger amounts of urine. I'm drinking more, not due to being thirsty but due to the worry of getting dehydrated from the diarrhoea. I can have it 6 times a day! It's usually bad in the morning when my anxiety is at its worst. I've been the docs so much with my anxiety and ibs that I'm now reluctant to go about this. I'm going to monitor it at home when I get the strips but just wanted to know if stress will make it rise as I'm now anxious about taking the test.I'm 36 and not over weight. Sarah."

Diabetes,Hypoglycemia and rage?,"Hi I've had this anomaly for years, at least since I was a teenager (I'm now 29).On my work days I get up at 6am to start work at 7am. I don't bother with breakfast normally partially because if I'm honest because I don't have time and can't be bothered..but also for another reason which I'll go into later. The only thing I have before work is a cup of sweet tea. I work in a factory doing a very physical job and almost everyday within an hour or so I suddenly become very angry..like ridiculously angry going over stuff in my head things that have recently annoyed me and even dwelling on things from years ago that have annoyed me which is ridiculous. This little fit of random rage lasts usually about an hour or at least till my first break at work when I sit down and having something to eat (usually a bag of crisps) and then the transformation is miraculous. The anger just disappears like it was never there or like it was a different person and I can't believe I got so tensed up and agitated by stupid stuff for no reason. It can, though not as often, happen after my dinner break. I only get 30mins so it's usually a quick couple of sandwiches but sometimes instead of rage I can become extremely sluggish to the point I almost feel drunk or like I'm gunna fall asleep standing up. People at work even comment and laugh that I look exhausted and like a zombie (this is also the reason I usually skip breakfast as that can sometimes cause me to crash and feel exhausted just as I'm getting to work and just starting to wake up) I don't have diabetes. But I've heard hypoglycemia can cause similar feelings of both anger and irritability as well as drowsiness. Please can someone help or can any diabetic relate to these symptoms if they become hypoglycemia. I dunno what to do and it's making me miserable. Oddly enough this rarely ever happens when I'm not at work.Thanks"
Diabetes,night time issues,"Over the last few months now I've been experiencing on going night time symptoms where I'll wake up anywhere from 130am - 5am with this slight feeling that I needed to pee. Recently though it's become a slight bloated feeling as well. The times I have been to pee during these early mornings I can void a fairly large amount and the colour is usually PALE YELLOW, ALMOST WHITE. This is usually a sign of good hydration but it seems like extra urine production. Sometimes though I won't go at all until the morning around 8am before work and other nights I have managed a decent sleep of around 6-7 hours.So this isn't happening every night but when it does happen, certainly the last few weeks on and off, I'll wake up around 4am and I'll be wide awake, have a slightly strange dryish mouth but barely noticeable, end up having breakfast with a large cup of tea and then eventually I'll end up voiding around 400ml and then 2 hours later, at 6am, I'll void another 700ml despite NOT having drunk anything in between. This is quite unusual as there appears to be extra urine production. As I said though it's not happening every night just to confuse things. I have heard of the dawn phenomenon and worried I could be having a version of this somehow, as it would explain the early morning waking. Then again, no nausea, I don't feel thirsty, never feel tired, or have any pain etc.This strange urination pattern has occasionally happening during the day time too over the last few months, where I'll pee large amounts twice in a few hours and then not go again for quite a while and have normal urination patterns/frequency. I monitored my BS levels a few times during the day and evening a while back and once during these episodes and they were all within normal non-diabetic range, around 5.4, 5.7, 5.9 6.1 two hours PP. From this and from my previous threads and from the feedback I got, I was quite certain I don't have diabetes to worry about, however these night time issues are still bothering me a bit. I've been in a new job since the start of the year and have hardly any symptoms during my work day and only once had a day where I had frequent urination. Also I had my prostate/PSA test and that's all normal, urine culture/test came back normal too.So I'm not sure what this could be. Doctor suspects it could be over active bladder but then I think that would be frequent urination with small amounts."

Diabetes,Metformin and probiotics,"Everyone knows that metformin gives you pretty horrible diarrhea?, but I haven't heard anyone suggest trying to fix it with probiotics, including of course yogurt.

It seems pretty obvious to *try*, but I haven't seen it online and certainly the doctors and nutritionists never mentioned it. So ... anyone?Thanks."

If anyone could give me some advice who has been diagnosed with diabetes or if anyone has ideas of something else it could be?

Diabetes,Possible symptoms of diabetes?,"Hi. For a while now (at least a 2 years probably longer) I've been having some odd symptoms and I've just been wondering if they can be symptoms of diabetes. One of the most concerning to me is visual abnormalities. For example earlier on today I was walking through town feeling a bit off. A sort of hard to explain feeling of almost feeling like I'd had a burst of energy but not in a good way. It made me feel sickly and unwell. This was followed a few minutes later by coloured spots infront of my eyes. Very similar to when you look into a strong light in the dark and the colours have burned into your eyes but stronger and slight dizziness. Along with the strange sort of energetic feeling. I had just eaten a subway. I often get these symptoms. Along with others. For example some days needing to urinate frequently (at least once an hour, occasionally more often than that) and sometimes feeling unwell in a way I can't quite put my finger on. Lately I have been eating an unusual amount of sugar (stuff leftover from Christmas that I want to eat before I start a diet) I'm a 32 year old male approx 11st . I'm very active now and have slashed the amount of sugar in my diet compared to 6 years years ago when I was 17 stone and used to live off cola and lucozade and sugary junk. I worry that although I'm alot healthier now maybe my rediculous eating habits when I was younger could have done some lasting damage. Thanks for any advice. Hi.

Diabetes,Glucose test,I've just had a glucose tolerance test and it has come back as being faults which I'm guessing is a good thing.

Diabetes,Vision and blood sugar,I have been having pretty constant vision problems for the past 7 months. A few months ago I took my blood sugar levels at my dad's house and after eating it was 180. The next day I took it again after eating it was 170. So I called my doctor and he ordered in ac-1 test. It came back at 5.8 which is borderline pre-diabetic. He didn't seem too worried and told me to start eating better and trying to lose weight. As I said I've been having a lot of problems I have seen multiple ophthalmologist and neurologists and have had no answers. I had gotten referred to a neuro ophthalmologist and Utah at the University of Utah Moran Eye Center. This neuro-opthamologist checked everything you could think of as far as eyes and brain and found nothing wrong. She said that she really believes that this is a metabolic issue even though the test so far haven't been very bad. Even with my ac-1 only slightly elevated could these constant vision problems be a blood sugar reaction? I'm waiting for a glucose tolerance test that I will be having done after the holidays. I do have a blood sugar monitor that I have been using the last few days and after eating anything usually my blood sugar is around 150. Is this enough to cause vision problems constantly?

Diabetes,Is there any connection between T2 diabetes and thyroid problems?,"My middle aged son who doesn't live in the UK has had thyroid problems for a number of years. Initially it was over active then when that was sorted hypothyroidism started. We don't see him often as he lives in east Africa and he sees a private dr, therefore has no access to the NHS and any advice they might give. He takes thyroxin and goes for regular check ups. Recently he was told that his blood sugar levels are high. He is not yet diabetic but I am very concerned that he is going that way. He tells me that he feels permanently tired but feels much better when he goes to the gym, which he does most lunch times. He eats and drinks quite normally and doesn't smoke but has become overweight, i presume due to the thyroid problem? Not obese I should add but he certainly weighs more than he should.There is no diabetes in our family so I wonder if it is connected with the thyroid problem. What advice can I give him to prevent T2 becoming full blown. I don't know what tests he has had, whether it was an HbA1c or a glucose test. Probably the former but he doesn't seem to know any results other than what he was told. Until he told me I don't think he realised the implications of T2, I think he regarded it as something he would deal with when it occurred and didn't regard it as too serious. How can I advise him ?"

Diabetes,Fasting Blood Test 5.9,"Hi, have just had a fasting test which came out at 5.9, never been high before, I have been told I need to speak to the practice nurse, as whilst this is not a diagnosis for diabetes, told it could lead there. I do like sweet things not the conventional choccy bars, I eat lots of full fat yoghurts with the fruit in the bottom as they say the low fat ones are full of sugar and I also have those innocent shop brought smoothies, so I expect it is this rather than a mars bar, which I do have occasionally. I do not want to go onto tablets and the note from the GP said to come in for a chat which I expect is to discuss how to get it down. I have googled and struggling to find that is a good level of sugar to look for as not all products have the traffic light system, is it less than 5% in 100 grams, also if you are meant to have 5 pieces of fruit per day what fruit is considered better for lower sugar, I love blueberries and bananas? I ask this because I thought cloudy apple juice was good but it has a whopping great 11% per 100gms. I am really struggling with how to get it down quickly if that is even possible. Any ideas appreciated. "

Diabetes,Diabetes,I read on a web site that a home Glucometer uses whole blood for test which includes red cells and these red cell reduce the sugar element. The Labs use the blood which excludes red cells. Thus the home Glucometer may be indicating about 20% lesser results which may give a rather inaccurate / undependable picture. On the other hand one may feel Glucometer results dependable as Red Cells element would always be there to constantly keep reducing the sugar level in the blood. Thus no need to be concerned if Glucometer shows results within specified levels.Can I have the views on this subject?

Diabetes,"New for me, may be pre-diabetic, how best to manage it","Hi, I have been overweight for about 18 years with gradual increases over time, I now weigh 18 stone and I really struggle as I am on anti psychotic medication which not only changes my metabolism, slows it, but causes my food cravings to go through the roof and also demotivates me to a large extent. Today my surgery phoned to say my GP wants to speak to me about a recent test and eventually I got it out of them that it was over my glucose levels, which I knew straight away relate to diabetes, and if too high can cause its onset, so I am seeing him Friday as I also find I have slightly sticky urine which I understand can also be a sign of it developing.I am very intrepid, fortunately I spoke to a very kind chap on social media who told me you can be ""pre"" but not go on to develop it full blown if you lose weight and watch what you eat and also my sister informed me that its unlikely I would have to inject, there are usually tablets you can take these days.So slightly relieved but still determined to get straight on and do something about it, out came all the healthy vegetable and rice based recipes, and I did up a diet sheet for my Gp to say which foods I am cutting down on, carbs and sugars and some dairy, what exercise I plan to take regularly and a basic one week diet sheet with the foods I shall be regularly consuming.I'm 58 and know these things often come on in later life especially if like me, prone to weight gain.I won't know where I stand till after Friday and have seen doc, but has anyone any advice? It would be warmly recieved. Thank you, Fiona"

Diabetes,Prediabetes,"I've been pre diabetic for the last several years. I recently had a fasting glucose test and it showed my blood sugar was 142.. which is basically the diabetic range, I redid the test the next week and I dropped back down to 118 the prediabetic range. I've never spiked to the diabetic range until that day. Could lack of sleep and stress maybe have spiked the glucose that high?Also I asked my doc if there were any meds I can be put on for prevention sakes, and he said no because then he said I would have to check my blood sugar and treat myself as if I was a diabetic. Is this true or are there any prediabetics out there that are on meds? Although I do realize exercise and dietary changes are the most beneficial. Looking forward to hearing about your stories. "

Randomly my toe next to my pinky toe on both feet will go completely numb, than following this will be a slow onset of aching that will travel up my feet almost like a sock. Last night was the worst had tingling, burning and numbness all around my feet and toes. Also following this is a strange sick type feeling, and fatigue. I have also had frequent urination for about 6 months, always waking up quite thirsty.This has started increasingly more for about a week. One blood tests i had out of the many showed a low possibility of diabetes with a 7.7 Glucose though i had a fasting test after that and never heard from my Gp so assumed it was normal. The weird thing is i have little anxiety when this starts. Though i have quite a bit of anxiety through the day. I have also just started back on Anti-depressants, not sure if this could be a side effect. Just seeing if anyone else gets this problem?? Any information would be great"

This week I’ve had these weird feelings and the only way I can describe it is “feeling low”. - it’s the feeling that I imagine diabetics to get when they need their dose of medication.If I eat or drink something the feeling goes away to a point. But then I can feel it gradually coming back. The shakes, the feeling low, and tingling sensation.i don’t know how else to express it. what I have noticed is that when I lay down I don’t seem to get the feeling as much and it sort of goes away (but it doesn’t)I feel like I’m on my own here and my partner thinks it’s dehydration and the fact we aren’t eating much whilst on holiday and always on the move. However I seem to think it’s different, please tell me there are others out there like this.what can I do? Is there a remedy? Is there something that will help me."

Diabetes,Could I possibly have diabetes?,"For about a week now I've been feeling very tired, I'm always thirsty, and really hungry all the time. I've noticed that in the night I'll wake up around 3 times needing to pee and needing to go get a glass of water because of how thirsty I feel. Usually I sleep through the whole night with no issues. A week ago I also noticed some bad bruising on my leg which still hasn't even began to fade. And I've had a sore throat with no other symptoms, for over a week with some minor white patches in my mouth. I also have a very good diet, I'm a healthy weight and I exercise regularly.I told my friend how I was feeling and she was just diagnosed as diabetic and said what I'm describing sounds very similar. She lost a lot of weight though whereas mine is the same as usual."
Diabetes,Suspicious diabetes test,Wenr for a test of diabetes because i was honestly worried for my health. They took some of my blood and told me to wait for a few minutes in the reception. 3-5 minutes later they come out and tell me i don't have it. Was my test genuine? I'm actually worried that they just tricked me to get going.Wenr for a test of diabetes because i was honestly worried for my health.

Diabetes,Can you have diabetes and/or Insulin Resistance and not have Acanthosis Nigricans?,"My knuckles and elbows have dark patches. Not my neck or armpits.Blood Glucose 84A1c 4,9But maybe my insulin is huge and I have such good numbers. This will lead to diabetes ? I am thin, no alcohol, no smoking no diabetes history but I am losing weight unintentionally. Started increasing calories dramatically and I started losing weight faster. Now what ?My doctor said that if my insulin is high we can do nothing about it. We just wait for diabetes to come. If he gave me drugs to lower the already normal blood glucose it would be dangerous.So I know from now that I will have DiAbetes ? Scary"

Diabetes,Type 2 Diabetes,"For many years now, and on a daily basis, I have suffered with what can only be described as severe symptoms of hypoglycaemia,.

And if insulin levels are too high, how does one bring them down and prevent further attacks?I am 69 now and I cannot go on like that.

Diabetes,Do I Have Diabetes?,"Hi guys, For the last two days or so I've been feeling fairly fatigued, dizzy and had some tingling in my fingers (although it may be my imagination). I've not really had any form of excessive urination however when I do need to urinate I just suddenly get a full bladder feeling, no build up. The main symptom is fatigue, that seems to be the overpowering factor. I've been worried as some of these symptoms belong to diabetes type 2, so I had a blood test done on a glucose meter (although not the best diagnostic, I just wanted a general idea). Around 3-4 hours after my last meal my blood glucose was around 4.9 to 5.1 mmol/L. Currently I'm a 17 year old male, 180cm tall and around 115kg, I do not have a lot of body fat, a lot of that weight is muscle. I do not have a great diet in terms of getting enough nutrients and I do not drink enough water.So what do you guys think? I've left going to the doctors as a last resort. These symptoms have suddenly started to happen one morning with no build up, anything to worry about or should I get further tests done with a doctor to make sure. Many Thanks"

Diabetes,"Numbness / ""Pins & Needles"" Sensation in hands....","I have been diabetic (type II) for over 10 years now. I have had a little numbness in my feet, previously, but for the past 5-6 months now I have been experiencing pins and needles sensation and some numbness in my hands. (my job has me on a computer most of the time) My doctor sent me to a good Neurologist and he is starting me on a low dosage of Gabapentin (100 mg.). The instructions on the prescription says I am to start with 1 capsule at night for a week. Then take one in the morning and one in the evening time, and slowly increase the dosage, as directed, to eventually up to 300 mg. I have heard that this medicine can make you sleepy. I have a concern about that, because I work during the day.Has any one else been on this medication, for diabetic neuropathy and did it work for you (ie., take away the numbness and or pain, etc.)?"

Diabetes,Is it possible to have diabetes with normal blood tests?,"My blood tests came back normal but I am having so many of the symptoms of diabetes that I'm worried. I'm 53 years old, 5' 7"" and weigh 225 lbs. I also have a pacemaker. With my weight, diabetes is not out of the question. I am starting with a new family dr next month and I'm wondering if I should bring it up again with this dr or if I'm just being a hypochondriac. Here are a list of the main symptoms I found online, how they manifest in me and why else I may be experiencing that symptom:INCREASED URINATION: I have had the urgent need to urinate every hour or two for at least 2-3 years. I get up once or twice during the night as well. I can't hold it for more than 10-15 mins. I have twice had accidents on road trips when I wait more than an hour to make a stop! have usually joked that this is a result of my having vaginally delivered 8 babies. My ObGyn says my bladder is not prolapsed and calls it overactive bladder. The medicine he gave me didn't improve anything and after a few months I stopped taking it. I don't remember the name. DRY MOUTH/EXTREME THIRST: For the last two years I am always thirsty. I have water bottles by my seat on the couch, in my bedroom, and in my car. I used to have one at work but I'm retired. My daughter bought me a table top water cooler because she was tired of filling my water bottle for me (in my defense, I really didn't ask her as often as it seemed to her!). If I don't drink huge amounts of water I have a very dry mouth. However, I'm on a lot of meds mostly for hypothyroidism, high cholesterol, and depression. All of these conditions could alone cause fatigue and just taking that many meds can also cause a dry mouth. FATIGUE: I'm always sleepy. I can lay down anywhere, anytime and go to sleep. I have sleep apnea and have had a CPAP for around 5-6 years and I wear it religiously. I can't sleep without it. I sleep on average 9 hrs a night and try very hard not to take naps during the day. I go to bed at the same time each night and around the same time every morning. But I am still so sleepy during the day that I have no energy at all and find it difficult to stay awake. My sleep dr even tested me for narcolepsy (Negative).DRY, ITCHY SKIN: My skin has been dryer the past 5-6 months than normal even though I drink so much water. Does that even effect skin dryness?INCREASED APPETITE: Definitely! But that may just be due to the fact that I'm retired and not as busy so I eat more. I definitely need more food to fill up than I used to eat. In fact, opposite of weight loss, I have gained weight since I retired 3 years ago. 10-15 lbsI also found these symptoms but don't have them. SLOW HEALING CUTS/BRUISESWEIGHT LOSSIRRITATED GUMSNUMBNESS/TINGLINGAlso, interestingly enough, my neurologist and my eye doctor have both found something within the last two years that caused them to ask me out of the blue if I had diabetes. I'm sorry this post is so long but I wanted to include everything you might need to know to answer my question. Thanks in advance for your answers and advice!"

Diabetes,Please Help ???,"Hello everybody im writing about an issue that is concerning me very much its not about Me its about my Father. Its a long story but i have faith that maybe someone has gone through this situation. My father is 52 years old he has diabetes tybe 2 for almost 17 years now, also high blood pressure but he has been able to manage it somehow until they put him in insulin, but during these last years since 2012 when he had his first attack, he got a cold than he couldnt breath his oxygen was very low and we were running from one hospital to another private public you name it and they just took money from us but couldnt help him, until after a week in the same situation i got a call from my mum and she told me that the dr told her that my father is not going to make it, i couldnt believe it i refused to, so i decided to call my aunt who lives in a different country and send our father there, eventually they saved him for ten days they helped him tremendously and the final result said that it was pneumonia, but they didnt give us any further information or where does the pneumonia come from, long story this happened again last year but not as severe as the first time because now we knew the symptoms, again we send him to the same country they treated him but there was no root cause given of why this problem is happening, this time during this year it happened again and we decided maybe its better if we put him in our hospital and maybe they can treat him better (since the first time they had no idea) and also the hospital we send him twice before for his treatment wasnt finding him the root cause ,fortunately they are helping him but they think what may causing all this is not pneumonia is something like blood clots in the lungs, lots of exams and blood test have been take now they are all coming fine even though the first time their rate was higher in the blood tests such as d dimere, troponin ct, and now they are coming back normal after several days of taking them and also the medications he is being prescribed, so my question is ? Has this anything to do with any other issue such as heart disease or genetics , what do you think is causing this he is very fit also he actually looks younger for his age he has no stress in his life but is a very nervous person most likely because pf diabetes . Has anyone had any related issue . Thank you!"

Diabetes,DIABETIS INSIPIDUS,"I'm a 77 year old male physician diagnosed with central Diabetis Insipidus about 8 months ago after experiencing headaches and very large volumes of urine per day. My MRI was normal and my blood tests consistently showed zero ADH (although this is not an accurate test.) I have a history of auto-immune issues (low thyroid, hearing loss, etc), so I am certain this is the cause of my diabetis insipidus, too.I originally used Desmopressin spray, which resulted in less urination but more headaches and low sodium levels. Then I started Desmopressin 0.1 mg tablets, which work extremely rapidly and very well for me. (Acceptable urine volumes, stable weight and no headaches!) The curious thing to me is that all I need is one quarter (!) of a 0.1 mg sesmopressin tablet at bedtime, which lasts 24 hours. I weigh myself at bedtime and in the morning so I know I have been stable in terms of my weight and fluid balance. What is even more curioser is that about every month or so I don't require any desmopressin at all for about 3 days! Then my urine volume steadily increases again. I wonder if anyone in this forum has found that a very low dose of a desmopressintablet once a day works well for them. Although I am a physician (a pediatrician, actually), I think my best source for comments about such low desmopressin doses is from patients themselves, since Information from my medical colleagues or in medical textbooks is scant to say the least. So what do actual patients think about very low doses of desmopressin? By the way, my diagnosis of diabetis insipidus is accurate. "
Diabetes,ddavp routes,"Hello, I have had DI and hypopituitarism since I was 16. I have been taking ddavp with the rhinal tube. I only take .05 ml dosage morning and night. I am having trouble getting the rhinal tube and the manufacturer said they are not going to make it anymore. I am devistated because I tried the pill a few years ago and could not regulate it. The pills did not always work and when they did I could not even predict how long it would last. It is difficult to hold it together at work when you have to go to the bathroom every 30 minutes and all you can think about is when you can get away for another drink of water. Now the only other option seems to be the spray but the dosage it delivers is too high, I am not sure what to do at this point. Anyone else facing the same problem. Oh and I also have had bags under my eyes for the last few years, I was wondering if anyone else taking nasal ddavp has had the same issues. Thanks in advance for any replies!"

Diabetes,SOS: Extreme non stop Fatigue and Diabetes 2,"I finally decided to ask for help on this forum. So many people here mention fatigue! I am mid 60x's, obese, severe arthritis with 2 failed knee replacements, Diabetic Neuropathy and recently became Insulin dependant. I know that the weight is a huge factor but I was also just told not their 1st concern! I try very hard to eat well and thanks to the Insulin my blood sugars are slowly coming under control, I've been having several serios urinary tract infections that end up making my infection become septic, I'm then very confused as the infection is now life and death! Back to the subject, I eat well, trying to move more, tried many, I think, healthy supplements from reputable companies. Right now I'm drinking high protein drinks from high whey protein powder.Can anyone please help me ASAP! I can't keep living life like this! Thanks Susan"
Diabetes,Mom of a 17 yr old living with DI,"My 17 year old son was diagnosed with central Di last June 2016 along with adrenal insufficiency, thyroid disease and low testosterone. All of this stemmed from malignant tumors called multiple Germinoma (brain cancer) which damaged the pituitary gland. We have already been through chemo and proton radiation. Thankfully the cancer is gone and we go every 3 months for MRI's...that my son has to be put to sleep for because now he experiences anxiety and having claustrophobia. We are currently at Mass General Hospital in Boston where he was admitted 2 days ago because of his creatinine (Kidney) levels being high. Apparently they believe the chemo drug carboplatinum and previous use of some Motrin, and antibiotics (had wisdom teeth out last week)has damaged his kidneys. Noone told us to stay away from these meds. His Di is out of control and has been for some time. We knew he peed alot and drank alot even while taking his ddavp and living with this. I had voiced concerns to his endocrinologist that he has some good days and some awful days. Now that we are in hospital and speaking with all different teams. IF HIS DI IS CONTROLLED HE SHOULDN'T BE PEEING EVERY HOUR OR MORE AND GETTING UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT SEVERAL TIMES!!!! I am beyond frustrated right now!!Right now they have him taking him double his ddavp dose but yet he was up and peed 3 x last night. We are in one of the best hospitals in the world and they are still baffled!! I just want my son to have a normal life. Any feedback would be much appreciated"

Diabetes,"New Symptoms, Possible Diabetes? ","To whom this may concern, I have been experiencing some unusual symptoms lately that I am waiting to discuss with my PCP about at my next office visit. I guess that I'm looking for some opionions and advice by posting this. Over the last few weeks I have been extremely thirsty. I drink a lot of fluids throughout the day yet even so, I'm still craving fluids more than ever in the evenings. Nothing seems to quench my thirst no matter what or how much intake I get. In particular, I've been craving a lot of thirst-quenching fluids like ice, milk, and fruit flavored drinks. My urinary frequency is increasing significantly which I figure is likely due to the excessive fluid intake(?) I've recently cut back on high-sodium foods and carbohydrates in my diet and I've been eating more fresh fruits and vegetable as well as a lot of protein. These dietary changes were recommended by my provider in order to achieve weight loss yet I only seem to be gaining weight despite my efforts (not giving up any time soon though)!. I have struggled with my weight all of my life, I'm a 21 year old female with a BMI above 50... I'm working on it, but I'm concerned that my new symptoms may be related to something going on whether it be diabetes or a deficiency of some sort. I do have a strong immediate-family history of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The last time I had my hemoglobin A1c checked was 6 months ago which resulted normal at 5.2%. My medical history/ current problems include obesity, hx of ovarian cyst, polydactyly, iron deficiency anemia, hx of PE, unexplained chronic fatigue. I've had a full work up with several specialists including Rheumatology, Cardiology, Gynecology, Hematology. Many of my labs to check for thyroid problems and different autoimmune disorders have been completed within th last 6 months and all have resulted essentially normal. Thoughts and/or recommendations are appreciated!Thanks. Brayden"

Diabetes,Sugar drops....questions,"So I've had issues with my sugar getting low for a while now. My doctor has been monitoring my sugar for a couple years, borderline diabetic. My Dr tells me to not worry about it getting low and not to give in to the symptoms because my body will recover on its own and I have enough sugar stored that I will be fine. Says if I eat or drink when I feel the symptoms then I will give myself diabetes because I'll be over time raising the blood sugar levels. So my question is......have any of you experienced the same advice and symptoms? Super dizzy, shakey, confused, weak feeling, clammy palms, tired. Ive noticed if it gets below 70, even after I get my sugar back up, it seems like the rest of my day I feel off and tired. Is that normal? So at 67-69 I feel like I'm going to pass out. Should I really not eat or drink like the dr said?? I'm having a hard time with this. So I've had issues with my sugar getting low for a while now.

Diabetes,Low Carbs,"Hi, I am in the process of trying to sort out my low blood sugar/hunger/faint feelings. I feel it's hypoglycemia, it may even be diabetes, hence posting here.So my question is regarding the Low Carb diet, which has been strongly advocated in another discussion on another forum. People swear by this, personally it seems very onerous to me and I can't afford to keep up with it.My GP said that a balanced diet would be better and that, while not against Low Carbs at all, she said it was only meant to be a temporary diet, for a month or so. This is because it may be harmful for the kidneys.So I can't deny people's experiences, nor do I seek to. But I'd like to know if others have managed these symptoms/conditions without recourse to a difficult (IMO) diet?Thanks"

I am wondering if I may have some form of diabeties and if eating sweet things is linked with it. I have booked an appointment to see my GP but at the moment due to Xmas my appointment is 19/1, so thought I would ask for advice on here. Many thanks in advanceWish you all a great XmasGeorge ( UK ) "

Diabetes,Headaches and pain every evening for past 3 days,"Hi. I'm not sure if my 48-year-old mom's fever-like symptoms of headaches and pain right now has anything to do with diabetes, but in case it does: About 5 months ago, the doctor said that my mom was at risk of being diabetic and diagnosed her with pre-diabetes and prescribed her to take a 500 mg tablet of Metformin every day. After another checkup one month ago, the doctor said her glucose levels were normal again, and she was to stop taking Metformin. Starting one week ago, fearing that her glucose levels might rise too high with all the holiday food, my mom unwisely decided to take a 500 mg tablet of Metformin every day again. 3-4 days later, after a heavy lunch (not sugary foods), my mom's body starting shaking and teeth chattering, which calmed down after ~15 minutes. For the past 3 days since that shaking incident, she stopped taking Metformin but she'd get a gradual headache that's light in the morning but gets heavier throughout the day, till evening when she starts feeling cold, she loses her apetite, and it feels like her body's hurting from the inside -- massaging helps that pain. Her forehead temperature's fairly normal in the evening, maybe slightly warm. She got her flu shot about 2-3 months ago, so is this just from a fever, or is it something to do with diabetes or those 3-4 days that she unwisely took Metformin last week? Her next appointment with the doctor is in 2 weeks and we can't get an appointment before that -- what should she do?"

Diabetes,Diabetes 1: insulin needs way down,"I'm 63, diagnosed with type 1 diabetes 15 years ago. I'd got to a fairly high dose of insulin, about 40 units of Novorapid at each meal and 24 units of Lanctus each day.Earlier this year I suffered a severe back spasm and started doing exercises to help. These had the unexpected effect that I needed lower doses of insulin and with my GP's advice (she's a diabetes specialist) I eventually went down to 20 Novorapid per meal. This went on for some months.At the end of July I was rushed to hospital with chest pains, which turned out to be pneumonia with diabetes-related complications. While in hospital I initially continued my previous insulin doses but found I was getting hypos and had to reduce my Novorapid doses to 10 and then even lower. This was in a period after I'd had surgery, was on multiple painkillers, and found even minor exertions tiring because I got out of breath.Now I'm out of hospital and my surgical wounds have healed although I'm still feeling some chest pains which I'm told are normal after-effects. I'm down to one painkiller, Cocodamol. I haven't yet resumed my back exercises but am getting out a bit more than I used to as I'm visiting my wife in hospital.What puzzles me is that I'm still only needing insulin doses of around 10 Novorapid with each meal, and my control seems to remain good - I've had an annual review since my hospital stay which confirms this. My weight is down by 10 lb or so, my waistline is an inch narrower, but I'm probably still overweight.Any ideas what could have caused the drop? Anyone else had similar experiences after illness or surgery?"
Diabetes,I'm a major hypochondriac but I need reassurance,"Hi! My name is Lizzie and I'm very concerned. Let me start by telling you that I am possibly the biggest hypochondriac- not by choice.

My parents both suffer from anxiety and depression although they take medicine. Right now, they are going through a divorce and this has been the hardest time of my life - nothing has been easy these past few months and unfortunately, I am having a hard time thinking about the future and what life will be like (due to my anxiety). I can feel myself falling into depression when i catch myself at random times starting to cry. This is my current problem- I think I have diabetes. Trust me when I say that i think i know all of the symptoms. 3 months ago, none of this was happening or at least I didn't realize it. instead of waking up with a positive attitude- i wake up every morning and start my day by looking for symptoms. I have not had any kind of sudden weight change, I am not thirsty frequently, and I do not urinate an excessive amount. But, I have been seeing stars and changes in my vision over the last month and i'm guessing that could be a sign that my prescription needs to be changed- but since it is a symptom of diabetes- i'm concerned. Along with that, at randoms times in the day/ my foot will suddenly ""fall asleep"" but only for a few seconds and although this is a symptom of hypochondriasis/ anxiety, i'm convinced it is diabetes. sometimes I catch my hands shaking and i think it is low blood sugar but then i work my self up and have a panic attack (which could also be from my anxiety) I don't have dark spots under my armpit a or on my calves and i don't usually have a dry mouth. But rencebtly, whenever i go to the bathroom, I start to think that is is too frequently and i get the feeling i have to pee when i don't (anxiety) and whenever i take a sip of water, i think that it could be excessive thirst.

Diabetes,Might have diabetus? ,"Hi, I've been ill for three years now and no one can get to the cause of it. I've been complaining of fatigue, weakness, weight loss (everyone including my doc thinks I have an eating disorder which i don't)!! So frustrating. Doesn't help cause i did have one in the past. I've fainted four times in my life and no one has really looked into it. An ambulance came once and checked me over said my blood sugar was low and just told me to go get a milkshake from macdonalds instead of me waiting in a&e for 5 hours. Docs haven't seemed bothered. All the symptoms seem to fit. Lost a lot of weight a few years ago which I've maintained but lately have lost more (probs due to stress) not intentional at all, but been feeling nausea when I'm hungry and when I eat I feel better but sometimes can be other way round.All general blood work fbc, kidney, liver, thyroid, eye test, heart are all normal. Today my doc found Ketones in my urine and she begged me to eat (lately I'm stressed and have no appetite), reoccurring UTIs, never feel like I can get my thirst even after drinking loads all I drink is water, frequent urination. muscles aches it started in just my hands and feet but has now turned to my legs aswell. It's not pins or needles or needles it's like shooting pains, it moves all over my body. a bit of swelling in my feet, Heart palpitations now and again, tension headaches sometimes, never been a headache sufferer. A funny taste in my mouth. Feel like I'm going crazy."

Diabetes,Muscle Weakness on metformin???,I have been on metformin for about 3 months and at 3 weeks developed severe weakness. Subsequently I have had to stop working out (aerobic cycling and weight lifting) due to severe pain in my back as a result of the induced weakness. I am taking Coenzyme Q10 and B12. Has anyone else had a simlar problem? What have you and your physician done to counteract the problem?
Diabetes,Young children and NDI,"I have a young boy that has the inherited form of nephrogenic diabetes Insipidus. He is currently 4 years old and was diagnosed at 4 months.

Maxed doses of medication. No salt diets allergies and sensitivites.

Diabetes,My Diabetes fear... (ramblings of a looney toon),"Hey, guys!Before I begin, I want to let everyone know that I am set to be tested for Diabetes, so I am taking action, but I haven't been able to get an appointment with my GP before early December, so I have a bit of a wait ahead of me and I really need to vent. So, if you guys can help, offer any advice, put my mind at ease, in way mean, shape or form, it would be very much appreciated.So, I'm David, I'm 28, from the UK. Admittedly, I am overweight, I'm about 19 stone, which is about 266 pounds, and I stand at about... I dunno, maybe 5'9""-5'10"". I don't drive, so I walk a fair amount on a daily basis, and my job, though part-time, keeps me on my feet quite a bit, so I am mobile. I don't work out or take much exercise, but I wouldn't class myself as a sloth, either.Gosh, I am trying to include as much as possible, so you guys have all the info to perhaps offer up some pearls of wisdom, so chances are this is going to get rambly. It should also be known, as well, that I recently just got better from a small bout of health anxiety (constant fear there's something wrong with you; hypochrondia), so a lot of my fears may be coming out of left field unnecessarily, but honestly I can't help it.So, I am going to tell you some things I have been going through recently, things that are making me think I may have Diabetes, and you guys can just tell me what you think. Here goes...Recently, I have felt like my vision is going downhill slightly. I feel like I am yawning all the time, though I wouldn't necessarily say I feel tired (lots of yawning, though), and while I do sleep at nights, I struggle to remain asleep. So, there'll be a few hours sleep, wake momentarily, back to sleep again, maybe waken again, sleep some more. I don't think I urinate more frequently than usual, and I don't have the constant thirst that is often associated with Diabetes. I don't notice any drastic change in my weight, either. Now, Neuropathy, this is where most of my concerns lie... my feet are fine; I have feeling in them, they don't tingle. Occasionally, they go to sleep, though admittedly that is when I am sitting on my butt, being inactive. My ankles, occasionally, feel a little stiff, and I have caught myself, though only a few times, trying to walk straight and going a little off center. Here's the doozey, though... my arms/hands - I have these intermitant discomfort in my forearms, on both arms. I don't know if I would consider what I am feeling pain, because it doesn't prohibit me from doing things. It's not a pleasant feeling, far from it, but it doesn't overly hinder me. My muscles twitch a lot in my shoulders and sometime my fingers on my left hand (my little finger and my ring finger especially) twitch of their own accord. My right shoulder goes through bouts of hurting; some days it'll hurt, the next it's fine. The thing is, though, if have been tested for Diabetes before, though it was a while ago, and the results came back fine. So, even if I did have it now, what would be the odds of me having some kind of nerve damage already?Lastly, and I am sorry if this is gross and too much information, but I am also currently dealing with a skin infection, which is pink/red, doesn't smell very nice and quite itchy, in my groin area. It doesn't hurt or anything, and nor does it itch constantly (only sometimes), either. I heard this can be caused by Diabetes.So, guys, that's it. I am sorry if that was a pain to read, but I am really anxious about this. I would love to know what you all think, and feel free to ask any questions. Help me, guys."

Diabetes,pre-diabetic,Hello i am 23 years old overweight and have been told I am pre-diabetic. I have had 2 blood fasting tests with a result of both 6.8 and 6.9. I am worried about this and am trying to eat as helthy and exercise as much as i can. I also have been experencing weird sensations since my hands are always cold and they get tingly as well as my feet and legs. I also have this weird body feeling like I am fizzing inside can this be due to my sugar levels. Thanks

Diabetes,Diabetes 3 and 4?,"My wife was rushed to hospital in August with what turned out to be pancreatitis. She's slowly recovering, but her pancreas and gall bladder are still affected and she's needing variable doses of insulin to keep her blood sugar controlled.She says she's been told that different parts of her pancreas are working on and off, and the result is 'a mixture of type 3 and type 4 diabetes'.Anyone heard of this? A web search says that type 3 may be a thing but seems to be associated with Alzheimer's. A search for type 4 yields only sites which carry serious security warnings from my antivirus software.I haven't yet been able to get hold of the hospital's diabetes team to ask them about this. Like most specialist nurses these days they're pretty stretched."
Diabetes,Severe weight loss!,"Hey guys. I am very concerned about the health of my dad. He is 58 and he has diabetes. He had this disease for the past 10 or so years. He was very health and had pretty good amount of body weight as well. He wasn't over weight or obese by any means. However for the past 3-4 years, he has started losing weight very fast. He has feels weak and his memory has started to suffer. He doesn't consume sugary stuff unless he is on a wedding function or some sort of party which is VERY rare by the way, even then he consumes very controlled amount of sweets and sugary stuff.I am VERY VERY concerned about this health. It is giving me nightmares!!I have talked to him several times already about this condition but he is one of those men who DON'T like to listen to anyone. He is very independent and ALWAYS gives others preferance over himself and his health. And I have several times grown angry with him because of this.Anyways, I have come here to ask other people with similar diabetic condition to help me out here.He WON'T visit a doctor or physician because I have tried several times already. So as a result I have started taking certain measures which I think will help with his health and weakness.I have bought 1. Chickpeas2. Red Apples3. Organic Farm milk (Buffalo) In the past months I have been giving him one bowl (100gm) of chickpeas but they didn't help much with weakness or weight. May be they have been working but I haven't noticed it much. So I have started giving him Milk (0.25 liter) and one apple (sliced less then or equal to 70 gm) before bed time.What other alernatives do you suggest will help him in gaining some weight (for bringing him in health weight category) and helping with weakness.Are there any formula powdered milk that can be mixed with the regular milk for helping him with weakness and weight?All the suggestions are very much appreciated!Best"
Diabetes,Diabetics Toe/feet problem,"Hello everyone. My mother was diagnosed with diabetics about 5 years ago. She has lost weight considerably ever since then. About 1 months ago, she complained of having no feeling at all on one of her toes. Even if she steped on pin or someone cut her on this toe, she could not feel anything. I suggested she went to see her Doctor. On geting to the clinic, the doctor suggested that she should be admitted as her blood sugar level was too high and it needed to be controled before they can do anything about the toe. They gave her different drugs which makes sometimes the sugar level to be too low. Last week she colapsed twice. A the end of last week, the doctor called me and told me they need to amputate this toe because it is infected and that was the only thing she could suggest at the moment. After several cosultations, I approved the one toe amputation.Surprisingly for me, the doctor called me again that they will need to amputate the entire feet as it has been infected and that is the only thing we could do if I do not want her to die. Please I just want to ask anyone here if amputation is the only solltion for such problem? I look really confused now. "
Diabetes,No change in blood sugars,"Hi,I'm not diabetic but I have some odd symptoms and I'm wondering if anyone can provide some insights. About an hour or two after eating, I'm experiencing severe symptoms which include exhaustion, shakiness, palpitations and difficulty concentrating or focussing. I frequently am unable to stay awake. These symptoms gradually wear off but it takes some time. My mum has diabetes so I've been getting her to check my blood sugars. My fasting bloods are usually between 5.1 and 5.3 - after eating, even only an hour or after a meal my blood sugars aren't elevated, if anything they're marginally lower at 5.0-5.1. This is the case even if I've eaten a meal which is high is sugar and refined carbs. What I'm wanting to know is whether not experiencing a rise in blood sugar following a meal is normal? I recently had a blood test done as I have Vitamin B12 deficiency and nothing else showed up as abnormal. Looking online I think my symptoms seem to match post prandial syndrome but I'll obviously go and talk to my GP. It's the blood sugars that I'm curious about - I thought someone in here might be able to let me know whether experiencing no rise was normal?Thanks all, much appreciated"
Diabetes,I need advice on prediabetes,"So a year ago by nonfasting bloodsugar was 120 about 20-30 mins after eating fastfood. I just had my non fasting done and it was 150, but i was under a lot of stress and anxiety(i thought i had a stroke), think i drank coffee and had a sub with white bread and dressing 90 minutes later. i am about 80 lbs overweight and as of them i hadnt done cardio in a long while. since then, about 3 weeks ago i've lost 12 lbs and am doing 15 miles of intense cardio a week over a span of 115 minutes.my resting blood pressure with coffee in my system is currently 120-130. What are the odds that i went from nothing to prediabetes in just a year? could that extra 10 points be because of white bread, lack of sleep or stress?

I drink more than 3 litres a day which is way more than I used to. If I don't drink water for about half an hour I start feeling dehydrated.In addition to this I've been having trouble with frequent urination, I don't know whether this is just a result from drinking so much water, but it is getting in the way of my day to day life as I'm constantly needing to go to the toilet, and the need is reasonably urgent. I go to the toilet between 8-11 times a day.I do feel very tired for a lot of the time, but this is something I've been experiencing for a long long time.I don't know whether I'm being a bit hypercondriacal in being worried that it could be diabetes or not, could someone help me in telling me what you think or giving some advice?"

Diabetes,early symptoms of hypoglycemia,"HelloMy main issue at present is adrenal insufficiency, but I have been having issue of lower than normal (for me) blood sugars about 2-3 hours after eating.My fasting sugars are 5.2mmol - 5.3mmol (93-95). After eating, they go up a bit...as is normal...but then they drop to 4.7mmol (84). This isn't what I would consider hypoglycemia, except I start to feel shaky and have cognitive issues (akin to tunnel vision, hard time with memory and doing tasks or finding words).Is it reasonable to assume that every person has a different level of sensitivity to sugar drops, or that one person might feel symptoms of being low at 4.7, while another might not feel symptoms until they get to 3.9?I have an appointment with my internist in a few weeks...I want to bring this to his attention but I am pretty sure he's going to look at me like I'm an idiot."

Diabetes,Diabetic Retinopathy even with treatment will still cause blindness? ,"Hi, I'm 25years old female from the Philippines and I have been suffering from visual disturbances for years. I've been to a LOT of opthalmologist and hospital but I haven't gotten the right diagnosis. Which is really frustrating because my vision problem has been progressing and I haven't been to a doctor since Feb due to financial issue. I've done quite a lot of research about the symptoms that I have been experiencing:-Blurred vision-Diplopia-Floaters-Flashing/Arcing of lights-Black spots-Severe vision snow or insect like flying on my vision -Eye pain- Scotoma- After image- Water like wave in my vision- cloudiness/ haziness- aura like visual disturbance on my peripheral vision the get large when I move my head - A week ago I notice an odd black spot near the center of my vision that appears appears when I tilt my head. Its quite opaque can't see right through it and it gets large As I continue to tilt my head. This is alarming and I got really scared I've been to a LOT of eye forums looking for people who experience the same sympstom as I have and did a lot of symptom checkers and Diabetic Retinopathy always one of the results. I got scared I still haven't been diagnosed with Diabetes but I am also experiencing symptoms of the disease like ants in urine, weight loss and thirst. I'm so scared to losee my vision. for me Diabetic Retinopathy is similar to death sentence. I heard that even with early detection and treatment DR it will only slow the damge of the disease but won't stop its progression and eventually you will still go blind. I'm afraid to lose my vision what worry me the most is that I only have $4 in my pocket, I don't have health insurance"

My sugar levels are tested in morning and 2 hours after dinner. morning sugar 130 to 143. I have been on meds since 4/6/16 not really seeing an improvement. I also have bad diareahea.

Diabetes,"Hey, guys","Hello, everyone!I decided to post a message on here, because in my next GP visit, which is on June 15th, I am going to ask him about diabetes, because I think there is a possibility I may have it. Be that as it may, know that I suffer from health anxiety / hypochondria, and am known to worry about things when there is no just cause.I'm 28; admittedly, I am a bit overweight, I'm about 270 pounds. My grandmother and my greatmother both have diabetes, but they were both diagnosed late in life. I guess I don't know much about diabetes, so I am just looking as much information as possible? What are the early symptoms, the warning signs? Does it take long to diagnose? How much does it effect your daily life?I appreciate any help you can provide me. "

Diabetes," Diabetics on Insulin Have a Complication called, “Diabetic-Frozen Shoulder""?","Just wondering if any of you have gone through the Diabetic Frozen Shoulder?I have been a Diabetic for about 20 years, on Lantus and Metformin.I have had Frozen Shoulder for about 8 months and it's crazy. Scar tissue grows around your shoulder joints and you do not have much of a range of motion. For example, I can not put my had behind my back or lift above my chest. It is also very painful. They are not sure how to really treat it. I think it this is especially true with us Diabetics. Apparently the scar tissue is much more dense and the issue is more pronounced.I wanted to know anyone eles's experience here and what did and did not work for you?Cortizone joint injecitons did nothing and I had 2 and one in the doctor's office, a round of sterroids, anti-inflamatories, pain pills etc etc. lol(Something for you all to be aware of too. Usually hits woman between 30-60. May be horomeone related, a virus or an auto immume issue. No one is sure.) "
Diabetes,Metformin and B12 deficiency,"I am 70 and have had diabetes for 21 years. Almost from the time of diagnosis I was prescribed Metformin as well as eventually going onto two types of insulin. Over the years I had been feeling tired, lethargis, no appetite which I just put down to old age. I have never been overweight, being 9 stone when I was diagnosed but over the last three years I have lost weight as my appetite was very bad. At one time I was 67 kgs and now I am 57kg. I saw a doctor and had some blood tests done and I am ""borderline B12 deficient"". I have found out that Metformin is given to overweight women as it is an appetite supressant, something I hardly needed! Metformin is one of the main causes of B12 deficiency. Those side effects they talk about on the information leaflet that comes with the tablets doesn't actually mention B12 but gives a lot of the side effects, one of them being tinnitus, something I've had for years. Vegans and Vegetarians can get B12 deficiency as you get it from animal products but obviously from drugs as well. A week or so ago I took it upon myself to stop the Metformin and instantly my appetite came back, I actually felt hunger pangs for the first time in years! I have had to increase my insulin slightly to keep my sugar levels down but just being able to eat more makes me feel better.Today I am starting a course of B12 injections, one every other day, five doses in all and hope that this helps with the deficiency symptoms. Another case of having to take one drug to counteract the effects of another drug. If anyone is on Metformin it may pay them to look up Metformin and B12 and see if anything they are experiencing could be caused by taking it. "
Diabetes,Help with husband type 2 Diabetes,"Hi, My husband has had type 2 diabetes for a few years he is nearly 69. Firstly just diet, then metformin dose increased after initial dose. He has recently had more bloods done and now the gp has added Gliclazide 80mg in the morning. The gp just rang and explained and left out a prescription. I am no stranger to diabetes as our son was diagnosed with type 1 age 2 in 1974. At that time my husband although he helped would not learn about the condition as I tried to do. He is the same now just not interested and thinks he can just take the tablets and get on with life. My questions are as gliclazide can cause hypos should he not be testing his blood sugar level and what about inbetween meal snacks. The gp did not mention anything when they spoke. What do you think. I know he will no want to do tests and probably say I am over reacting. I try with his diet but he is not good at trying new things. The other thing is alcohol now more important because of the risk of hypos. I have suggested he stop drinking at leat until he know how this new tablet affects him. I am sure he will take m uch notice though. I have enough to deal with as I too have health problems and family problems. He also has arthritis and prostate problems. I am very worried but there is only so much I can do. Just always accused of nagging which I probably do. I am not expecting him to be 100% perfect diabetic just to be interested and try would by a start.Any one suggest anything. Thanks for reading this."
Diabetes,"Pre diabetic diagnosis, now what?","I was diagnosed last year as prediabetic. I tested my sugars daily, never got higher than 9(Canadian reading). I stopped testing as my levels were good.

I was and am still on tablets metformin, plioglitazone and gliclazideThen a few years back my sleep started to improve and now it is very good. As my sleep improved my diabetes also improved and I was about to reduce my diabetes medication on medical advise but then I lost my appetite. As I lost my appetite my glucose reading empty stomach started to rise from 5 earlier to 6 -7. Two hours after dinner my diabetes gets very low as I take medicines after dinner. It gets low to 5. As a result my diabetes is lower after dinner compared to day time when I am eating lightHas anybody else had similar experience where their diabetes is lower post dinner as compared to empty stomach due to medicines. I am currently not wanting to reduce my diabetes medication. Can someone explain this why sometimes diabetes is lower post dinner compared to when you have eaten light. Overall my diabetes would not be classed as out of control."
Diabetes,Duloxetine 60mg capsules (Cymbalta),"First of all I am not diabetic but I do need help on the above tablet Duloxetine (Cymbalta) which I believe is given to diabetics for pain relief (or so my doc tells me). I have Cervical spondalosis which gives me extreme pain and for which I take 30 tabs daily plus Morphine and liquid Morphine. Doc has prescribed Duloxetine which is an anti-depressant but which I believe also helps pain. Can anyone on this site who is diabetic tell me about Duloxetine or have they taken it and has it helped with pain? I am afraid to start taking it as it does not have good reveiws and is used mainly as an anti-depressant. There appear to be too many side effects, some of which I have already from morphine and it appears to be difficult to come off. If anyone can coment and help me with this I would be really grateful. I suffer chronic pain 24/7 and my meds at the moment are having little effect on controlling the pain. They just keep increasing morphine dose which I am a little afraid of. Does Duloxetine really work in controlling pain? Thanks to anyone who can ehlp.A|rran103"

Diabetes,Night Hypo,"hi everyone,sorry for the long post, i am on a quest to find out what is happening to me.For the past 2 years (since a bad virus and lots of stress in my life), i have been a complete mess and i can barely function. I have muscle pains, i can't diget anything (i have gastroparesis), tons of reflux, went into AFIB twice, restless legs and a few other things.Ever since i was a kid, i had problems with my blood sugar. I would pass out as a boy if deprived of glucose for too long. Over the years, i have tried to eat a low carb diet, but as soon as i go too low carb, i get sick: nausea, headache, fatigue, stomach ache, pins and needles...Despite my blood tests never revealing anything drastic (either always in the low or high range with B GL and HbA1c), i have struggled with this all my life and find myself eating carefully, every 2 hours.In Feb this years, i had my second episode of AFIB, and i have been taking Beta Blockers since then. I am eating much more now, and i feel hypo quicker than ever. I also sleep worse than ever, with my body waking up every hour, as in a panic, with eleveted heart beat, stomach grumbles, feeling of being wired, and occasional sweat. And i also have the need to stretch my body. This happens about 7 times per night. I am totally exhausted in the morning.I guess my question is: does this all sound like Hypo to you? i have never been diagnosed. I am especially concerned about my sleeping problems. I would almost rather be insomniac than experiencing these jolts that wake me up and freak me out so many times per night.thank you for your help.eric "
Diabetes,Diabetes below the knee amputation & Personal Independence Payments,"Hi all, I'm asking on behalf of my mother (she's not great with technology!)My mother has had type 1 diabetes for 45 years, and as a result has ended up having a below the knee amputation in the middle of last year. She has since applied for PIP with a view to getting the enhanced rate for motobility to allow herself to be independent again. She has missed the enhanced rate for both daily living activities and mobility activites by one and two points respectively.We have since appealed, and whilst in our tribunal argued that whilst she can walk up to 50 metres with her prosthesis, she cannot do this on any uneven ground safely (for example, the bus stop is 500m away, and the curbs are uneven enough that she cannot walk there). We have also argued that she cannot reasonably get up and move within a ""normal"" time zone. It takes her 2 or 3 times the amount of time it would take myself or my partner to do the same trips. I understand that within the law, the safety and reasonable time period is supposedly considered, however when I brought this up at the appeal, our judge told me they don't consider these points and that it wasn't her fault we lived a 5 minute (30 minutes for my mother - if she can even make it at all) walk from the bus stop. Her diabetic consultant has been with her since the discovery of her diabetes, and included a medical assessment saying that whilst she can with an extreme amount of effort and unreasonable amount of time move the distances asked, she is not happy for my mother to do this since it lowers her blood sugar levels and can make her hyperglycaemic. Does anybody else have any experience with amputee PIP claims? I understand that my mother is still semi-mobile, but the effort it requires to do every day tasks, I feel she should be receiving more help than she is. It feels like she is being penalised for trying to do things on her own. The idea of PIP is to make the claimant independant is it not?"

Diabetes,Is this normal? ,Hi Everyone. I have question I checked my blood sugar after 1 hour meal and it was 143. While Google says it should be under 120 for truly normal people and 2 hours after meal it should be under 100. My fastings are always under 100 But my 1hour or 2 hours after meal are difftent. They are not like the standards level that the health articles say. My A1c was 5.7 which again is not that normal beacuse for normal people it should be under 5.7 or around 5%. Mine is not that perfect. So what do you think am I considered diabetic? 
Diabetes,Is this pre-diabetes?,"I don't know what came first; if I became addicted to sugar then started expereincing blood sugar problems because of the long term usage, or if I always had blood sugar problems which lead me to the adddiction through usage. Recently though it's been getting worse.It basically went like this: I would eat high GI foods (namely chocolate) any time I felt my blood sugar dropping, this lead to a vicious, almost decade long (currently 19) cycle of eating chocolate to curb the blood sugar drop. I would be kidding myself if I thought this had no effect on my body. Main symptom: If I don't eat, my blood sugar will fall rapidly. Always thought it was normal but apparently it isn't? Maybe this is more a issue of storing glycogen rather than diabetes?Thanks."

Sometimes I'm able to get back to sleep, sometimes I have to get up and eat something and then I'll feel better afterwards. Now this morning, I woke up at 4:30 and ate something just because. I woke up around 6 shaking and nervous again. I was able to go back to sleep until 8:30, and had to poop, but didn't feel shaky. I've been dealing with a lot medical wise, and that's when those symptoms started. The doctor put me on 0.25 mg of Xanax. I don't have the feeling very often, usually only that one time and always in the morning. Could this be hypoglycemia or is it just anxiety? Thank you for any input. "

Makes an appointment for me to see a nurse on Wednesday 10th Feb, 2016) and gives me some diastix (urine testing strips), telling me to go home and test myself at random once or twice a day. The GP also has changed one of my other medications because apparently it is loaded with sugar. The only thing the GP did say was that I needed to completely cut sugar and starches out of my diet, something which I will do, but am already finding there is sugar in things like the sugar free squash I use and in bread.What should I be entirely cutting out; what should I be avoiding, and what can I still eat?Also; any more general advice. I am in a wheelchair 24/7, so physical exercise is very limited. I am on a LOT of other medications (including a mixture of both liquid and long release morphine, at around 600 to 700mg per day.)I am on benefits and feel extremely lucky to be so, even if having tried working and volunteering in the past has left me in hospital, I'd still give my left arm to do it if I could. Unfortunately it's just not practical. So erm; I guess what I want is advice and help. I know virtually nothing and am kinda scared to eat anything now. But I know there are a lot of people who live with this condition and make it through the day. So I will be able to; I just need to be a bit more informed. That's all. Thanks in advance;Christopher. I am in a wheelchair and use a urine bottle, so testing this way is a lot easier than I would have thought it would be for most people.

Diabetes,Is continuing blood sugar 14.5 worrying?,New years eve 2014 my blood sugar went up to 30.4. I had been told by my doctor not to check my levels as I would panic but this day I did because I felt so ill. Over the next 3 months he increased my medication so that I am on 4 x 500 metformin daily and 4 x 80 gliclozide daily. Once my blood sugars were at a good level - average 6.5 - I was told to stop checking them regularly a.d told I cannot get test strips and lancets on prescription. I decided that for peace of mind I would buy my own supplies and check once per week. Everything has been fine until 27th December when it was 16.2. I have been testing once per day since then and only twice has it been below 10. Today it is 14.4. I am beginning to worry but given the doctor was adamant I should not home test do not know what to do. Any suggestions?
Diabetes,Update of previous forum discussion re high blood sugar,"Since I last write on the forum about my concerns about my constantly raised blood sugars things have changed so I wanted to let all the people who responded what the situation is. I was in hospital on an unrelated matter (mild heart attack) and my blood sugats were tested 4 times per day and they were never below 11.8 and went up to 22.9. The ward staff were very concerned and referred me to the diabetes consultant who saw me on Friday just before I was discharged.He said that contrary to what my GP said, I do need to be testing every day, at least once but at the moment whilst it is so high it has to be tested 4 times per day and the hospital have given me the relevant number of testing strips.The consultant has also told me that, contrary to what a number of people on the forum have told me, poorly controlled blood sugars are not always caused by too much sugary food and drink. in my case the raised sugar levels are due to the long term use of steroids (because of uveitis) and the particular form of Type 2 diabetes I have which can cause quick deterioration. I have 2 other friends with type 2 diabetes who had to start using insulin after only 2 years as a disagnosed diabetic. It looks as though I may soon have to go onto insulin myself if the blood sugars. does not start getting to safe levels. In my case after talking over my medical history he feels it is likely that my blood sugars are particularly sensitive to illness ie if I have an infection they will go up in addition to the diabetes getting worse - it has nothing to do with what I am eating/drinking"
Diabetes,Accu Chek mobile stripless bs monitor,I have received the above this morning. Anyone any experience of using this one. I chose it for my husband as it had good reviews and is stripless however I did not realise that the lancets and cassettes needed are so expensive. I have had to order more lancets as it only came with 12 which are single use only. My husband had difficulty in getting a drop of blood out but did eventually and and got a reading of 11 just before lunch which I think shocked him a bit and he is talking about changing his diet.

Diabetes,Best Foods for Type 2 Diabetes,"Hi Can someone offer an opinion on the best fruits for t2 diabetics in terms of not causing spikes in blood sugar. Also which bread, my husband eats wholemeal bread which I believe some say causes spikes. I have read that rye and granary are better although he complains granary gets stuck in his dentures). My local supermarket bake a wheat, spelt and rye bread which he likes, would this be ok. Also yogurts he usually has low fat fruit yogurt, have read this is not good either. Have been looking at recipes on Diabetes UK which seem interesting have saved some to try. Things seemed to have changed a lot since my son was diagnosed with type 1 as a 2 year old way back in the 1970s. Then it was all about portion size and making sure you got enough carbohydrate inbetween meal snacks as well. I am ordered a blood sugar monitor which should arrive this week. Hopefully it will tell us where he may be going wrong in terms of what to eat. Before anyone says you can get them from the gp or manufacturer I tried that with no success. Thanks"
Diabetes,I think I am addicted to sugar. Is this bad?," Hi, I'm 15 and I really eat a lot of choclate and sugary foods (I have been for about 1-2 years) . I work out and study quite a lot so I lose a lot of the glucose I get from it, but recently (last month) I have been getting very thirsty very fast, I drink almost 1 liter of water during my 2 hour workout time! And each night I bring a mug of water and drink it throughout the night (I wake up thirsty, drink some water, then sleep again). I've been told excessive sugar use leads to constant dehydration, which makes the body start using the fluids in your cells, dehydrating them, I've noticed this in my eyes, they seem to have gotten smaller! Three days ago when I realized this , I immidientally stopped eating any kind of sugar (I only use 1-2 teaspoons of sugar in my tea daily, and sometimes from coca cola). I don't know if I'm over reacting or if this is something I should seriously be worried about. I'm currently planning on not using sugar until my thirst for water goes back to normal."

Diabetes,Does this sound like diabetes?,"So for the past few days I've been having shaking symptoms, not just of my hands but it feels like my entire body is sorta vibrating, it happens even if I have eaten or not. It does seem to go away for a bit if I eat something sugary. However it's not long before it comes back, I'm also experiencing weird feeling in my legs like cold feet. Never had a blood test for diabetes, I had a blood test at the end of last year but it was to check for any problem with my heart. Nothing was found then, would diabetes have shown? Even if they weren't looking for it? A weird thing was the other day, my hands and body were shaking. I was making a jam sandwich but I never got to eat it I had to go to my sister's house. I had stopped shaking by the time I got there and was alright? I don't get Dizzy or anything and I've never passed out yet (yl touch wood I dont) but I don't know what's going on or how to even begin to explain it to a doctor.. guidance?"

Diabetes,Dry mouth with Metformin,"I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes in 2011. I am currently taking Metformin SR twice daily plus Losartan, Atorvastatin and Omeprazole. For the past 15 months I have had an extremely dry mouth. I have it all the time. It does not keep me awake but if I do wake up I am cotton mouthed until I have a drink. In 2011 I had a wisdom tooth removed under Lidocaine (knocked me out completely). 2 weeks after this I noticed a dry mouth but thought it was to do with trauma after extraction. A year later I was sent to see dentist in Birmingham Hospital who told me the Omeprazole I take for a hiatus hernia was causing dry mouth. Apparently according to him it is notoriousfor it. My Doctor changed it to Esomeprazole and for 2 years I was free from trouble. Then 15 months ago it started again. I have tried coming off Esomeprazole and going back on to Omeprazole but no change. My doctor tells me to use artificial saliva and suck sugar free gums etc - this only makes it worse. Sacharine of any sort aggrevates a dry mouth. I am at the end of my tether now. I have used every lip balm on the market but nothing appeases this dry mouth. Drinking a hot drink or a cold one eases it at the time but it is soon back. If I do eat anything sweet or savoury my dry mouth goes into overdrive like I am sucking a lemon. HELP."

Diabetes,Worried I might have diabetes,"Hi,For the last couple of weeks I have been feeling thirsty and needing the toilet alot. Sometimes in the middle of the night, and despite the amount I'm drinking I feel dehydrated in the morning. I also have thrush.I went to a walk in centre this morning and they tested my urine and said it is not diabetes. I hadn't yet eaten and I had drank alot of water since the night before.I'm just wondering if there's any chance the urine test would not be accurate as the amount of water I've been drinking may lower the glucose levels?They've given me medication for a UTI, but I'm not experiencing any of the other symptoms for UTIs such as pain or dark urine, as it is coming out almost clear.Also my brother has type one diabetes and was diagnosed in his 20s, I am also in my 20s.Thanks,Katherine"
Diabetes,Metformin Safe for Non Diabetic Men?,"I've read many articles about the possible benefits of Metformin outside diabetes treatment. However I've also read a few articles about health dangers such as heart damage. It seems there is paradoxical information, countering the anti aging claims there's articles stating Metformin actually shortened lifespans in male mice while extending it in females. Is Metformin a safe medication for non diabetic men, or even diabetic men?"

Diabetes,Travelling with Diabetes,"Hi, I’m 20 and been a type 1 diabetic for 19 years of my life. I have recently started a new project for university about how people with diabetes can sometimes be put off travelling because of their condition. I would be really interested to hear of peoples personal experiences of travelling with diabetes, how they have gotten over stressful times while they have been abroad or travelling abroad; and also the problems they have faced while travelling (for eg. how it can be difficult to keep your insulin in a cool area), things that just simply annoy you and cause unwanted anxiety etc. I’m here to listen to you moan so hopefully I can design something that will ease the stress of travelling to different countries Please don’t be shy and play your experiences down (I’ve probably experienced a few in my time with diabetes too).

Diabetes,Afternoon shakiness,"Hi,I frequently have the symptom of shakiness in the afternoon usually an hour or so after lunch (so it's not like i'm hungry). It usually occurs if I'm doing something eg weeding in the garden or going for a short walk or even just cleaning. i'll feel really weak and shaky and need to sit or lie down or even sleep for a while. I often feel better if I eat something or have a drink which makes me think it's low blood suga but I've been tested for diabetes and I don't have that so drs just say it can't be low blood sugar. I am frequently very tired so i've also been tested for thyroid problems, iron, vitamin deficiencies, basically everything! Everything comes back normal. Drs have told me to just put up with it but it makes it very hard for me to do day to day tasks such as housework or go out anywhere.It seems to happen more often at the weekends and I don't know if this is because i'm eating a bigger lunch then (at work I always just have sandwiches whereas I might have a jacket potato or beans on toast or something at weekends) or maybe it's just cos i'm more likely to be moving around at weekends than if i'm sat at my desk.Does anyone else experience this? Google always comes up with hypoglycemia and a lot of sites suggest diet changes, has anyone changed their diet and seen improvement?"

Diabetes,Type 1 Diabetic with Health anxiety advice and support needed.,"Hello, I am a type 1 diabetic and have been so for 14 years since my diagnosis in 2001. I was diagnosed aged 5 and am now 19. In the past i was never really clued up about the risks of having diabetes, and the long term problems it could cause. My parents were always there to keep me right, but tended to just react to high or low blood glucose rather than making the effort to tightly control my diabetes. I have had a bit of a difficult upbringing (My mother is rather mental and hard to live with, and my father left us when i was 12 due to my mothers attitude after her 6 month spell in prison. My grandparents and father looked after my 2 siblings and myself whilst she was away. My family home which was once a reasonably happy and controlled place sharp became a doss house full of radgies and charvers pumped full of drugs my mam would let in and welcome as her friends) Through my teenage years i was very naive and would make some bad decisions regarding my health such as skipping insulin doses, leaving blood sugars to run high and going on wild benders with friends taking all sorts of substance as i wanted to have a good time. I also have been a regular cannabis user from age 13 until recently when i decided to stop for a while and now am smoking occasionally due to the amplified anxiety i get from heavy usage (i do not believe cannabis is the route cause for my anxiety but when i started becoming anxious the weed wasnt helping at all). When i was 16, in January 2012 i was admitted to hospital with DKA as i hadnt been testing or controlling my sugars and just living to party (I never thought anything bad would happen back then)... so i fell asleep after a heavy night only to sleep through my time to do insulin. I woke up in a very bad way; puking, wreching could barely see etc etc and if it hadnt been for one of my mams 'friends' gut instinct that this wasnt normal id have not been writing this now. I hadnt even a clue what DKA was, i was f***ing clueless!! it could have been prevented, my mother could have done more for me. after recieving treatment and returning home i came to a realisation... that i literally had my life in my hands. This was scary as i was for years just palming my diabetes off saying to myself 'whats the worst that could happen?'. I did start to take a little bit better care of myself after that, and tested 5 - 10 times a day after that. My readings were awful most of the time above 12mmol into the 20's sometimes and would have hypos too. There never seemed to be a balance. I cant imagine how bad they mustve been prior to my DKA.. My home was still being used by people and the lifestyle hadnt really changed at all, my siblings were not being taken care of properly, everything was a total mess and out of control. The only thing the DKA experience had done at the time is woke me up a bit. After another year of my mothers wild parties and neglect id had enough and left my mother to live with my amazing grandparents who i love so very much and owe my life to, literally. My little brother was taken from my mam and now lives with our father.. my younger sister still lives with my mam and i have a lot of respect for her as shes very strong minded. Even after i moved i was still making some poor desicions, taking substance and not caring for my health as much as i could. As the months of being away from that environment went on i started to get anxious quite often, feelings of worry for my health. Id start thinking that anything i took could kill me, and when i would take something like mcat id get very anxious and wish it was over. If i took a pill id get so worked up about it kicking in and have anxiety attacks. After months of 'before i take it and waiting for the drug to kick in anxiety' i decided to stop taking harder drugs for good and just smoke weed. I started to become more and more concerned and worried about my health, and started taking much better care of my diabetes, but still not as good as i could have. I managed to land myself with a full time job last year and was extatic. Though i had my job, money and was taking better care of myself i was still becoming increasingly anxious and worried everyday about my diabetes and what the future had to hold. I began reading into things and came to a realistation that our food and drink supplies are riddled with dangerous chemicals, and started avoiding certain products containing aspartame and MSG in particular. I noticed a decrese in physical discomfort when avoiding these products but still the anxiety was getting worse. (although i was in a better place with loving grandparents i was struggling mentally) I began distrusting my insulin because it was made using Genetic Engineering and demanded the doctor let me try animal insulin (Hypurin Pig insulin, i got given long and intermediate to account for my Novomix 30 and Novorapid) I also started costing the NHS a hell of a lot in test strips using up to 50 a day which i still do, as i was desperate to know where my blood sugars were all the time. It was christmas just gone i started using the animal insulin, and ive never been so scared in my entire life... to have my whole existance in my hands and to have to keep watching how the new insulin was acting made me a wreck. I was in turmoil. Id never fealt so responsble for my own life ever, i had predictable blood sugars whilst using novmix and novorapid, although not within range enough. But when i changed insulin the peak and the way my levels would change was very different. I mentally couldnt deal with it and after 3 days decided to change back to Novomix 30 and Novorapid... my anxiety then hit the worst its ever been. Everyday at work i was bombarded with panicing thoughts and the feeling i could be dead tomorrow, i was checking my blood sugars more than ever and every bad reading id get id be so upset and depressed about it i just didnt know how to handle it (thankfully i still have my job, as i wont let my work colleagues know im in that state, i did so well to keep it all inside and will do everything to keep my job). Through january i was having a lot of panic attacks and feelings of losing control, every second that went past fealt like i was urging closer to my demise, or to the loss of my sanity. Every toke of weed i had (which in the past helped me alot with nerves and stress) made me feel twice as anxious and hopeless. I decided then to quit weed for as long as i saw nesseccary to clear my head and try combat this daily anxiety. Stopping that helped, and my change in thoughts were very noticable although the anxiety still remainded very powerful. My anxiety over that month was terrible it always fealt like i wanted to just scream help at the top of my voice, it was as if something was trying to break out of my body but couldnt. it was horrible, i began to think this is how id be for the rest of my life.. I found being with my gradparents and friends and just talking helped me relax a little and the extent of that anxiety subsided after around 4 weeks with a clear head (although i was till a wreck it was a hell of a lot easier to deal with). Now i would say my mental state was how i was before my terrible episode; anxious about my health, checking sugars all the time and worrying a lot. but no where near as bad as i fealt (i fear this could happen again though) i now only smoke weed on select occasions like weekends or nights out and find it can go either way in terms of relieveing or enhancing the anxiety. I plan now to continue having breaks from weed, and never get back into a habit of everyday use... This whole experience has changed me as a person, im the most empathetic and kind person you could ever meet and all i want is world peace and to live happilly. I love being just in positive peoples company and communicating with people on higher levels, and spending time with my grandparents and good friends. Everybody i know says ive changed so much its as if im a new person, that im kind and my outlook on life is great. I have my struggles to thank for me being this person. Although im broken i wont ever stop being as good of a person as i can. I believe love is all i can give back, and i feel great satisfaction when i make someone feel good about themselves or let them know ill always be there to love them. I never used to think like that. i used to be a selfish naive, clueless, idiotic human being. Late last year i was on the hunt for anxiety relief.. I found psilocybin (magicmushrooms) to be the one of the most effective recent experiences of my life, as it shows you how beautfiul this planet is, and how connected we truly are. The few times i did mushrooms last year before my severe episode of anxiety, i fealt great afterwards, and thank them a lot for making me see how amazing everything really is. I havent done high dose sessions (obviously with my diabetes i need to take extreme precautions) but plan to in the future, as my research has suggested a journey on psilocybin could really really help me with my terminal illness based anxiety. I have also experimented with MDMA recently, in very controlled amouts and have had some of the most anxious free nights of my life with some of my best friends. (i had to overcome the whole drug kicking in anxiety when using these substances) but would never dream of taking anything that would harm my body. I have done these with pure intention to relieve anxiety. Im very thankful to have had these amazing experiences in my times of mental hell.. I also tried a Continous Glucose Monitoring System recently on trial to see if i would benefit from it. My anxiety about waiting to see what my blood sugar was reduced massively as i could just take this machine out of my pocket and see where i was. I hope i have a good chance of getting one permanent and am seeing my Diabetic specialist in a couple weeks to discuss this further. Im seeing a therapist for CBT treatment as of recently, but thats still in its early stages. I also meditate as much as i can and always try to think positive and be as kind and loving as i can be. I just wish i was happy and content. Onto my diabtes treatment... At the moment i use 12.5 - 14 units of novo mix in the morning and bolus at work for lunch around 2 -3 units of novorapid, depending on what im eating. i then do 12.5 - 14 units of novomix at teatime. i usually have a lowering blood sugar 2 and a half hours after injecting my morning dose. and thats after a spike up to around 13 - 14 mmol max an hour after breakfast. so ill snack to keep myself up to about 6 -7mmol before my lunch and bolus (unless its not a weekday then i wont have lunch or bolus and just snack lightly till teatime) Usually my sugars are ok between 5 - 9mmol till i get home then ill do my evening dose and have tea and usually my sugars will spike to 13 -14 max after that too, then presumably my sugars will drop after 2- 3 hours and ill snack lightly until bed to bring my sugars between 7 - 10. i always make sure by blood sugar is going up slightly so i dont risk nighttime hypos, and stopping having supper has helped a lot with waking hyperglycaemia. Ill wake up to do a shot of insulin 2 hours prior to me waking up properly so i dont inject my morning dose and eat breakfast with a stupidly high reading. i used to wake up with readings up to 20mmol after precaution supper, but now it will only really go as high as 14mmol, and thats easier and safer to rectify. Also if my sugar ever spikes way too high ill give myself a bolus dose to bring it down (im doing a lot less corrective than i used to as my eating habits have changed)(my sugar levels are never the same all the time sometimes they can be higher or lower than expected, theres really no guarantee). I used to skateboard straight after teatime dosage and meal which caused a hypo as early as an hour after injecting so ive had to stop skating after my teatime dose. In the future on occasions I plan on keeping my sugars at a decent level, going skating before my tea then dosing after an hour or so skating rather than before, because i dont want to have to stop that as i love skateboarding). Also my insulin has been playing up a bit recently, not peaking at usual times meaning im staying high for longer after meals and going lower later. Its a real juggling game and im just trying to get by, i know this post is long but i really needed to get it all out. Any feedback, advice, and support would be great. Thankyou for your time. Peace and love."

Diabetes,"Severe symptoms, no answers","Hello,I dont know what forum to choose since she has no formal diagnosis. I am posting on behalf of my mother who has been sick for over 4 years and no doctor has been able to properly diagnose her. Her symptoms are uncontrolled and she seems to be getting worse and worse. She is 65 yrs old and here are a list of current symptoms:Severe hot flashesShakesProfuse sweating & chillsHeadachesBurning pain across whole body and at times lasting for hours, pain is excruciatingLow energy after activity, she becomes weak and short of breath, can only walk short distancesStomach aches and nauseaShe has had the following tests done:Cat scan of abdomen - negativeNuclear medicine xrays - negativeMultiple blood work - came back abnormal with excessive adrenalin in bloodThe only thing that seems to help a little bit is eating at least every 2 hours or less. She will eat until she starts feeling better and the more she eats, the better she feels but only for a short period of time. She tends to feel the best late afternoon, into the evening.She has an excellent doctor who is trying to help but unfortunately he has run out of ideas on how to treat her. She has tried many different medications including ketamine treatments. Some of the meds have worked for a while but then they eventually stop working.Each day her symptoms are different.PLEASE if anyone can help, we are in desperate need of direction/help.Thank you"
Diabetes,New here - Diabetes out of control,"Hey all! I am 29 and was diagnosed with diabetes type 1 when I was 17. It was a horrible time in my life as it was due to an abusive home life and severe depression, so I never really accepted diabetes. It's been a long long time but I'm finally seeing some sense and I want to control my diabetes. I'm terrified I'm going to die before I'm 40 and leave my partner alone. I've had no bad symptoms such as loss of feeling in my feet but my blood sugars have been a constant 25-30mmol for weeks at a time. It caused me to have joint pain and sleep constantly. After moving to England from Wales I had a terrible time trying to get referred to the diabetic clinic as they claimed they couldn't do anything until my notes came through - which took 4 months. So I've been here since early March and only got my first diabetes assesment last week.The results were that my blood sugar was high, weight was up, chlolesterol was up and blood pressure was fine.I really want to try and become sensible about my diabetes and I'm just basically looking for like-minded people to talk to. Maybe we can encourage each other to look after ourselves?So yes, nice to meet everyone!- Matt"
Diabetes,Prediabetes and blood glucose levels,"Hi,I bought myself a home monitoring blood glucose tester as I was very worried I was prediabetic/type 2 diabetes. I am 58 and overweight and do little exercise.. My fasting blood glucose level taken this morning was 5.7 and I was wondering if anyone knew if this level is high and should I test myself again after a meal. I have been looking on the internet and one page says above 5.5 is prediabetic another says 6.0. Can anyone help?"
Diabetes,Diabetes diagnosis,I had gestational diabetes during my pregnancy. I gave birth a month ago. I'm meant to have my fasting glucose test next week so I decided to check my glucose levels at home. Yesterday I had a burger for dinner and 1.5 hours after having my dinner I took the test. It turned out 9.0. In the morning I did my fasting test and it was 5.3. I had 2 toasts of brown bread with Nutella for breakfast. One hour after breakfast it was 6.7. I had one full plate of rice with lamb meat and one hour after it was 5.7. For dinner today I had a burger and one slice of pizza and one hour after my sugar level was 9.3.Do you think I have diabetes? I'm extremely worried. Is it diabetes or pre diabetes? I'm very scared of diabetes. Are my sugar levels totally out of control? 
Diabetes,took my blood sugar monitor results to the doctor.,"so yesterday i took my own blood sugar reading using a monitor i bought and the results were, 2.2mmol fasting reading, followed 4 hours later by a 2.1 mmol reading 2 hours after breakfast, then after eating lunch and reading it again 2 hours after it shot up to 8.7mmol then 4 hours later it dropped into normal parameters of 4.4 followed another 4 hours later of 5.8mmol.. the doctor said it's definitly not normal and has booked me in for HBA1 testing next week. she also added (much to my surprise) that she was SHOCKED that with my symptoms i havent been tested sooner, seen as iv'e been feeling like this for 20 months and now on top of the already huge list of symptoms i have now started fainting. it took me doing my own blood readings to get the test booked in and some real action from the doctors..not good but at least the test is booked in now.hopefully i will finally get some answers and treatment or at least rule out diabetes.

Diabetes,Husband type 1 diabetic,"my husband was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in February / March, he is 45yrs old and a chef. We have so far managed to keep his blood sugars between 4 and 7 most of the time, the doctors etc seem happy with that. The problem now is he has become bad tempered with both me and our dogs and, even worse at work. He won't walk the dogs with me, he doesn't finish anything he starts eg we have a Motorhome which he started taking up the carpets and putting down Lino plus fixing a hole I accidentally put in the roof. Both jobs are left half done, he says he will do them but doesn't. I'm not a wife who nags I will ask twice then do it myself, trouble is I can't do these jobs myself. Last year we went away most weeks, we take the dogs and head off for a couple of nights, this year we've been away twice last time just before Easter. I don't know whether he feels ill or tired or what else could be wrong and he either doesn't know or won't say. If it's his health that's the problem then I'll sell the motorhome and stay home it seems a shame to pay insurance on it but only use it a couple of times a year. I'm hoping someone with experience of Diabetes can give me some insight into how he might be feeling."
Diabetes,Abnormal sugar intake,"I was tested for hypoglycaemia a few years ago and the test came back negative, although I'm not sure if it's possible to influence those tests at all. To put it simply on the say of the test at least 1 hour before I had already consumed over 730g of sugar. Also this high intake is not an irregular thing. On average I have about 300g of sugar a day in soft drinks alone. Not having high sugar drinks every day makes me feel really ill and extremely tired to the point where I have to go home from work (I work as an IT programmer so not a physically demanding job). To go along with this there have been a few occasions where I have been low on sugar and in physical pain which has made me collapse (while also loosing my vision, disyness, nausea, exhaustion and extremely fast heart rate (sort of the same as when you stand up to fast but on a much larger scale and for a period of a few hours)). I know my father has it as well which is why I went to get tested. However considering all the effects that point to it and no other reasonable explanation I have found would it be worth getting a second test or can someone else point me in a better direction ? Also note: high temperature even when feeling cold, resilience to most drugs and unable to ever get hyperactive no matter how much I try. "
Diabetes,Need advice as I'm concerned I'm being lied to,"I am fighting with the VA for an agent orange disability. I have several symptoms from it but am being denied due to not having type 11 diabetes. I have a constant thirst, extreme urge to urinate, have eye problems, have been diagnosed with severe poly neuopathy, a simple cut takes months to heal. My weight goes up and down like a roller coaster, have istemic heart disease and have had a heart attack with a stint inserted, always have a high white blood count. But I'm told the blood test show ""I DON'T"" have diabetes. I keep asking how can this be and never get an appropriate answer. Is there some kind of doctor who can really specialize in diagnosing this or am I just going to continue?"
Diabetes,Insulin not working as normal. Type 1 diabetic.,"So, ive been a T1D for 14 years. Im now 19 years old. I never really had good control of my diabetes over the years, and as a child my parents would more so react to blood sugars than control them. Through my teens i have been clueless about the dangers of having this disease, until about 2 years ago when i sh*t myself and started getting really bad anxiety because of my health. Thus i started taking much better care of myself. I am using novorapid for corrective doses and 1 bolus during work days for lunch, and novomix 30 twice a day. Since ive been checking my blood sugars loads i noticed and worked out how my insulin acted. I try to get my sugars between 5 and 9 for long acting injections. i would always get a spike to around 10 - 14 and then 2 and a half hours after my novomix by bloodsugars would be between 4 and 10 and i would snack very lightly to stop a hypo and keep them at a steady rate... however, in very recent times it seems that my insulin is being unpredictable. peaking sometimes at 3 and a half hours sometimes 4 or 5 then sometimes it would work as it normally would. But today for example i had a BGL of 9 before my tea and long acting dose. had some green tea and went for a walk.. after an hour my sugar spiked to 14(fair enough)... 2 hours (id expect it to be heading down; would usually be around 10 and heading down) still 14... 3 hours - 15!!.. usually by 3 hours id have had a snack to prevent a hypo! but its still high.. all this is making my life very difficult, and i cant exactly just go out with friends as i could be risking a hypo if it peaks all of a sudden. Any advice? im trying my best to get a cgm but up here my doctors are all cheap skates! i test 30 - 40 times a day as i must see where im heading, and also see fluctuations. i do 2 long acting doses of novomix30 and 1 dose of novorapid to cover my dinner at work(dont have dinner on weekend so dont bolus. My blood sugars tend to very good between 5 and 9 until the spike from eating, then after 2 and a half hours itd be around normal and id keep it stable by snacking lightly until my next dose. I dont eat supper as that cuases high blood sugars through the night but im in a bit of a predicament... i just want my insulin to work as it always has so i can get about as normal! Sorry for the length of this, and i bet it sounds like a jumbled mess but any advice and support would be greatly appreciated. Much love people. "

Diabetes,Will I have to go on insulin?,"I am Type 2 diabetic and I am on metformin. The last few weeks, my sugar levels have gone very high. My fasting levels are now the same as my levels AFTER eating and after a meal tonight, my levels showed 15.65. I am 61, does these mean I will have to go onto insulin or a higher dosage of metformin?"
Diabetes,Scared & In Denial of Type 2,"I am scared, ashamed and in denial of my type 2 diagnosis 3 ½ yrs ago at age 60, HBA1c 6.5. Managed since then by diet and exercise, but with very little GP monitoring, mostly my fault. The 6 month follow-up reviews have slipped to 12 months, nobody reminds me if I miss one, which suits my denial, I know it’s stupid but I’m almost trying to pretend it isn’t there.I was put on the short Intro to Diabetes course and a 4 part dietetic course, simply focused on losing weight. Llittle about management of diabetes diet, which is different to just losing weight! I lost 8kg but then lost motivation. Sadly with conveyor belt 8-10mins GP / nurse appointments, I just feel a nuisance, feels like they are clock watching!My latest glucose reading is 7.2 but I know it could be better if I both managed it and fully accepted what I have, BMI now shows 26.7. The GP wants to review in 3mths for Metformin which terrifies me, it seems to have so many side effects! But I don’t really know how to manage my diabetes, what and how to eat, there is so much confusing/conflicting advice out there.I swim energetically 4 times a week and my diet and meals are mostly sensible, until late evening, extreme fatigue and hunger so the ‘easy’ fix is to eat to relieve it, not go to bed. So the good dieting is easily undone. I know nothing about hypo’s or hyper’s, all confusing. Doesn’t help that they say there isn’t a specific diabetic’s diet! But I beg to differ, of course there has to be, not special foods but a specific dietary approach. Low, slow-release carbs, protein, the right fruit & veg, avoid high sugars, small well-spaced meals etc. And that’s just the little I have grasped, is it correct?I always thought that if anything big like this happened I would be open with myself and others. But I feel like those people on Embarrassing Bodies who can’t tell the GP or their nearest but can open up to 8m people! The overly PC hands-off approach doesn’t help either when the clinicians won’t spell out exactly what you are getting in to. How can they let overweight patients pass through their surgery for decades without spelling out the risks, then say ……. “Oh, by the way, you’re diabetic”?I’m not a Blog person and there is so much opinion and is the info reliable? I followed the thread here from poor barbara26695, worried sick with a sugar level of 9.5 reading and fearing a T2 diagnosis. After 70 replies and much opinion and advice; she was pronounced clear with a 4.5 normal sugar level.Please don’t scare me with too much info and also who am I talking to? Someone with a lot more knowledge than me, coz mine is very little? Can anyone help me please? Thank you."
Diabetes,Insole that increases circulation on Prescription in UK!,"In the leaflet on this site entitled 'Diabetes, foot care and Foot ulcers' it has a section that discusses how to help prevent Foot ulcers occuring. I don't know about anyone else but there has been little out there other than diet changes, weight loss and keeping foot damage to a minimum and so on that has assisted this. There is as I mentioned a piece that discusses annual foot checks with a Podiatrist and changes to look out for. This---- ''Part of this review is to examine the feet to look for problems such as reduced sensation or poor CIRCULATION. If any problems are detected then more frequent feet examinations will usually be recommended.'' What I have discussed with my Doctor is an Insole that featured in the Express Newspaper after Christmas, claiming (it has been clinically proven) to increase circulation. They are called Liqua-Care Flowgel Orthotics and are now available on Prescription! You just need to chat to your Dr. (or podiatrist probably), to see if you are suitable. Any of us that suffer Neuropathy pain and numbness are prime candidates! I have cold feet and bought some. They are brilliant, just need to save up to get a pair for each pair of shoes! ;o) x"

I am confused as im sure the dr's are if they were to admit it....fibro, CFS diabetes and thyroid issues could give me the same symptoms so how do i know which one is really is and who do i go to for help? i have brittle diabetes and am insulin resistant...my diabetologist won't consider a thyroid change as its not the norm or necessary.....where as i've done my research and there are potential benefits.......what if i could eliminate these symptoms....i could work and get my life back...I have also had terrible anxiety and a lot of stress in recent years which i am sure contribute to all of this....i've done councelling, EFT, antidepressants...for years now i have been aware that in going for a walk i feel like i have been injected with lead and i feel so heavy and exhausted and unable to continue...have had to of course to get home but felt very unwell with it and then just slept!I also have IBS and have recently been put on creon, an enzyme to replace the one i don't have any more?.thoughts advice anything....thanks"
Diabetes,Caring for new type 2 diabetic,"My husband has been told he is Type 2 diabetic and has been given a diet sheet. He's one of those people who won't discuss their health and will never allow me to attend doctor's visits with him - even when he went into hospital for knee surgery he insisted I drop him at the door and he didn't want to see me until I collected him to take him home.So I am ignorant about this new diet. He will not hear of me contacting the clinic for advice, saying its all in the leaflet. But it isn't!On the one hand, I read about the 'healthy plate' consisting of half a plate of carbs and the rest made up from protein and green leafy vegetables. On the other hand is the view that carbs are to be minimised and vegetables (except roots) protein and some fats should be maximised.Which is correct?"
Diabetes,Possible hypoglycaemic? ,"Hi all! Just wanted to see if anyone has had similar symptoms to me and if you had some advice.For 3 years now I've been suffering from tiredness, nausea, fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath, shakiness, lack of coordination and concentration and occasional vomiting and fainting. More recently I've been suffering from blurred vision and inability to think and speak clearly (stuttering and slurring words) and extreme thirst. I drink water constantly but always feel thirsty and have just grown use to it. After starting a full time job (a really great job!) I've been getting way worse, I think because unlike when I was studying I can't just come home after being out for a few hours and sleep like I feel I need to! I've been missing work and getting sent home after having funny attacks of the all the symptoms above. I saw a doctor and had a blood test and couldn't believe it when he said I was fine and its just stress. But I am not stressed! A friend of mine who is a nurse told me to test my blood sugar so for 2 weeks I have. In the morning I'm anywhere from 3.2 mmol/L to 4.8 mmol/L. Most days I am getting numbers around 3.2-4.8 mmol/L after meals, I've spent a lot of time in the 3's and even got a 2.7mmol/L reading last week just before lunch, needless to say I felt horrific.Has anyone else suffered from this? Any advice? I'm seeing another doctor Friday morning to show my results after he advised I continue monitoring my blood sugar for another week. I'm worried he won't be helpful as so far all doctors have brushed me off, saying I have eating disorders, I'm depressed or pregnant, I am none of these! I had blood work done recently but all came back fine, which I find confusing as a 2.7mmol/L is not fine! Any help or advice greatly appreciate, thank you so much! x"
Diabetes,"""Becoming diabetic,,,""","Hi there, anyone out there who can offer advice? I received this evening a letter from my GP following some blood test results. Of course receiving it on a Friday evening means I have no one to discuss my anxieties with until Monday - nothing like ruining your weekend! First of all. I have never experienced any symptoms of diabetes and was only ever tested for it in pregnancy with my son 9 years ago - all normal then. However, I have had gynaecological problems in the last 3 years. This resulted in me having a Total Abdominal Hysterectomy last November. I had a massive fibroid removed as well as uterus and cervix. It was a complicated op that took nearly six hours and involved a blood transfusion. Post op I was on iron tablets (not surprising considering my blood loss) but about 5 weeks on suffered terribly with fatigue. GP decided to blanket test for everything - thyroid, iron and glucose. As a result I was recalled to do a fasting glucose test. This came back slightly above normal so I was asked to retest. My gynaecologist, however, told me to wait a while as he suspected my blood had not fully stabilised. So beginning of April I retested and did Cholesterol at the same time. My my letter today says my results ""show that you are becoming diabetic"". This was a shock as I was expecting everything to have settled since January (my last test). What does this mean. Is it 'prediabetes' or is it saying I an so close to it I can't prevent it?i was on 'prostap' hormonal injections for 5 months for my fibroid. The aim was to reduce it pre-op - in the end the drug didn't touch it - too big. I have read that this drug in fact increases your risk if diabetes. Has anyone else had it before getting diabetes? Upsetting to think I took it for nothing and now it my have made me diabetic!! I can't be sure it's that of course but I no longer have fatigue, never had thirst or need for frequent urination. Any help any advice? I would be so grateful."
Diabetes,"help, advice re blood test results",GP found sugar in a urine sample. Had fasting blood sugar but asked nurse to do a fingerprick test at the same time result was 6.7 (pre diabetic I think) But I have just rung for my lab result and it is only 5.3! Is this normal to be so different?
Diabetes,Diabetes and food,i was diagnosed with diabetes feb 2013 and have been on oral medication since August 2014 and it is at the moment well controlled. I have been on a diabetes education day and had several talks with the practice nurse who has had additional training in managing diabetes. However just recenlt I have become confused about mealtimes. Neither the practice nurse nor the education day said anything about the importance of having meals at a set time each day but talking to friends who have been diabetic for many years they all say I have to eat at set times each day if I want to keep my blood sugar stable. However my blood sugar is stable even though I do not have my meals at set times so I am confused. Please could someone give me the benefit of their experience?
Diabetes,Looks like I'm diabetic and metformin was suggested,"I'm waiting for the results of a blood test today but the practice nurse said that on the basis of the last one I'm almost certainly diabetic: level was 7.1 and should be 6She said if I am diabetic the gp will probably prescribe Metformin: she already knows that my diet is very healthy and that I exercise, but I am overweight and have been for most of my life since birth.What experiences have other people had with this medication? The list of ""side"" (ie unwanted) effects is very daunting, except for the weight loss oneThanks in advance.

Diabetes,Blood glucose monitoring,"does anyone know why GPs are so anti patients monitoring their own blood glucose levels? I had been given a kit by the hospital but told by my GP not to se it except with their express permission. However, at Christmas I felt really ill and took it anyway and it was 30.4 since then I have been battling to get it down with changes in medication and this last week it has been down to 5.5 on average. During that time I have been asked to check the levels once each day in the morning but now they are back to where they should be I have been told I no longer need to monitor. I am unhappy about this because what if they go really high again? How would I know? Among my diabetic friends I find this is a common attitude among GPs but no-one knows the reason.

Diabetes,Dealing with side effects of diabetic partner,"Hi,I am quite concerned about my boyfriend's health. He has diabetes Type 1. I was not really worried about his illness when we first started dating, because he seemed to have it under control and I know that people with diabetes can have a long and healthy life, if they take good care of themselves.However, things look a bit different in our relationship these days. We recently moved to a different city, so that he could pursue the career he wanted. Ever since we moved, he has completely stopped taking care of himself. He still eats somewhat healthy and takes his meds of course, but he has completely stopped going to the gym. We had numerous fights about him joining the gym in the last couple of months. He is fighting 100% against me, saying that he does not have time to go work out anymore, because he has too much work and has to focus on his studies. He won't even go jogging anymore. I even offered to pay for the gym membership and go work out together to motivate him. He refused the offer. Our whole relationship started going downhill because of all the arguments, and as a result I gave up on trying to convince him to stay healthy.I know that stress makes it worst for his blood level, so that's another reason I stopped arguing about it.He recently did some blood work tests at the doctor. His results came out highly negative. He is worried about the results and so am I.Ever since he stopped working out, the side effects of his illness got much worse. He has really intense mood swings. I try to deal with them as much as I can, but he is randomely either very happy or very upset. I ask him what's wrong? And there are no real reasons why he randomely gets really mad at me for something insignificant I did.I really try to be as supportive and as patient as I can.Another side effect is that his libido is completely down and we never have intercourse, nor make out anymore. I tried to talk to him about it, because I believe communication is important in a healthy relationship, but he does not want to face the problem nor communicate with me. Instead, he finds endless excuses not to have sex or to avoid any kind of intimacy. He does not want to get any help whatsoever, because he says his priority is to finish his studies and be successful in his career. Everything else can wait. Unfortunately I tried to explain to him that health is more important than his studies, but he does not agree.I am pretty desperate, also I am not sure who to talk to about this, because everybody I know doesn't know the first thing about diabetes.Any advice would be greatly appreciatedThanksJoy "
Diabetes,Morning blood glucose,"my gp has asked me to start taking my blood sugars on a 4 day cycle - morning, lunch, dinner and bed.

Diabetes,Pre diabetic?,"In December, fasting blood work where I currently live (Hungary) to keep an eye on my high ALT and GGT turned up a slightly high fasting blood sugar of 6 mmol/l.Advised to excercise and lose a bit of weight (173cm/76kg) and do a checkup in 6 months, I kept up my 2-3 times a week running and went on a 6 week low carb, low cal diet in January. Also bought a home glucose meter.At the end of 6 weeks I had lost ~6 kg (70kg now) but suddenly started to develop severe night time dry mouth, thirst and need to urinate quite drequently and copiously, like a switch turned on in the 5th week of the diet. When I say severe my mouth feels parched and I still feel thirsty after drinking 2 glasses water. My fasting blood glucose in the morning is however consistently in the range 4.5-5.1 mmol/l.Should I be concerned? General health, energy, appetite otherwise good. I stopped the diet a week ago and am back on normal carbs and (slightly reduced, but normal) quantities. The thirst and dry mouth are however getting worse, the blood sugar in the morning remains around 5 mmol/l. Should I go back and bother the doctor now, or could this be a normal consequence of dieting that needs a few weeks to resolve?"

Diabetes,Diabetes and preventative antibiotics,"i am a fairly newly disagnosed diabetic - been on tablets since last May.

Diabetes,Should I pursue my symptoms? ,"Hello,So, about 2 weeks ago I went to my doctor because I have been experiencing frequent urinaton for the past month. There I told them I was worried about diabetes (my aunt is the only one in the family that I know of). So he told me to do a urine test, which they said was protocol before further test would be given. Anyways I did the urine test and he told me he did not detect sugar or protein but he did detect a little infection. So, they gave me the medication for UTI and sent me off. After finishing my medication, which made my frequent urination worse, I still experience freqeunt urination. Just yesterday my friend noticed that I peed at 1:30 then at 3:00 and then after drinking a lemonade drink from starbucks I peed again an hour later. I was wondering if I should go back to my doctor for a follow up? also I don't know if this is in my head but I feel like I am experiencing random tingles in my hands and excessive hunger ( I don't know if this is in my head).

Usually I can cope fine with a couple of hours but now, if I get 8-12 I'll be yawning by 9am and alseep by 10.I'm also REALLY thirsty, and my lips are dried no matter how much I drink. I'm eating more than usual too, but the thirst is the one I really noticed.About a week ago, and then tonight, I wet the bed. This has never happened before. I've been going to th toilet a lot anyway and went before I went to bed.I looked on the NHS's website and it said type 1 diabetes. I looked at the symptoms and another was genital itching, which has also started to happen (though only maybe two or three times a day). Pretty convinced I have T1 but my Mum doesn't seem to believe me and keeps putting off booking a Doctor's appt. Could it just be stress? Haven't told her about the bedwetting yet (when the first one happened I hadn't started putting things together and had assumed it was unrelated).Any help her would really he appreciated. "
Diabetes,Can this be diabetes?,"So since September I had off days where I would pee a lot. When I say a lot, I mean a lot like I had the urge to go every one hour and it was clear. The amount I urinated did not match with how much I drank. By late November and December it started to become a daily thing. The amount I urinated was not on par with how much I urinated in earlier months but I ended up having the urge every 2 hours and could only hold my pee up to 4 hours. I ended up going to my doctors because of this last week. Before I touch upon that date, I would like to also say that I have been experiencing excessive hunger (or what I think is excessive - I get hungery right after I eat meals - which may be normal really since I tend to not eat until the afternoon or even as late as evenings) and also an increase of pins and needles feeling in my legs and arms. Anyways, back to the doctor visit. During that visit I told them about what I have been experiencing and they ended up making me do a urine sample. My doctor said he couldn't find any traces of sugar (but will send it to the lab to make sure - I didn't get a call back so I assume it was negative) but they did find a trace of a uti. They prescribed me the medication that starts with a N (made me pee more than what was normal- I even had to wake up in the middle of the night which never happened). Now though I still experience hunger, and pins and needles (I cannot really say about my urination problems because I am still taking the medication). So I was wondering if I should go find another doctor and force them to do more tests on me? or is this all in my head? "

Diabetes,Diagnosed Type One at the age of 54.,"I've been a Type One diabetic for 10 years. I was diagnosed in the hospital on the brink of a coma. My blood had been checked in February of that year and everything looked fine. By April my eyesight changed from longsighted to short sighted; by May I was becoming thirsty all the time and by June my weight had dropped drastically. Not to mention extreme cramping in my legs in the morning.By the end of June I was in the hospital. There has been no history of diabeties in my family on either side. Up until then I was a relatively healthy 54 year old, the right weight for my height keeping up a heavy work load as a primary school teacher. I did have an underactive thyroid caused my Hashimoto's disease.The specilist at the hospital told me this is rare but has happened before. (I'm in Canada.) Everyone was totally surprised. My family and doctor most of all.I am finding it hard to find literature meant for cases like mine. Most type one contract the disease much earlier. Is there anyone that has had a similar experience?"
Diabetes,Am I prediabetic?,"I'm new to all this. Over the last 17 days I have taken random readings using ACCU 'prick and touch' instrument. The average fasting time was 7 hours and the average blood glucose reading was 5.8 mmols/L (same as 104 mg/dL). I don't drink alcohol or smoke. I'm inclined to 'eat when hungry and drink when dry'. I'm 12 stone 4 lbs and 5 feet 7 inches tall (or small - I'v shrunk) and I'm 81 years old. I'm not, and have nerver been, on a diet. Am I heading for Type 2? If so how can I avoid T2? Indeed, am I prediabetic?"
Diabetes,Very high blood sugar,"i was diagnosed with diabetes 2 and a bit years ago but it was treated by diet alone until this summer. I am now being treated with metformin sustained rsleazemg 2 tablets per day. I was told nt to take my blood sugars regularly as it would worry me too much except for 2 weeks when my prednisone was increased from 5 to 25 mg per day one week before and one week after a cataract operation because I also have an inflammatory eye condition called uveitis On average during that time was blood sugar was 14 and the doctor w as not worried, said not to continue monitoring blood sugars. However, today, I was not feeling at all well so took the blood sugars anyway and it was 30.4!! Went to the doctor and he told me blood sugars often go up when you have diabetes and an inflection which I did not know. I have actually got two Infections - bacterial urine infection and viral throat infection. Is it true that it can go as high as that and not be dangerous?"
Diabetes,type 1 diabetic and need some advice,"Hi, was only diagnosed Feb of this year. Im 22 and At first I literally thought nothing of it, kept and eye on what I ate and drank, but it never really sunk in that for the rest of my life Id be constantly watching what Id have to eat and not eat and how to manage being so high and hypos. Im so confused with my insulin intake in co ordination with the carbs I eat, I have to keep a diary now of how many carbs Im taking in, so they can put me on 4 injections a day instead of two. Im starting to feel terrible mood swings like other people mentioned on here and extreme fatigue. I didnt know if that was a symptom of diabetes? I need some advice from people who have had this disease for years and I feel cheeky to start complaining as Ive only had it a short while in comparison to others that have dealth with it for as long as Ive been alive. I get scared its going to cause complications with my heart as I already have a heart condition. I try to put on a brave face to family and friends and pretend that Im fine when really I would just like to sit and have an in depth chat with someone to clear the questions I have. Every day I think of questions. I get scared at work when I can feel a hypo coming on and often think people dont take me seriously when I say I need to stop and drink some juice and eat a few biscuits. I think that some people think Im being over dramatic. does anyone feel this way?really appreciate a chat xxx"
Diabetes,Type 2 Diabetes and the drug Victoza,"Hi everyone, My husband is 61 and was diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes three years ago. He is 5'10 and weighs around 260 pounds or just over 18 stones. He takes Metformin just once a day, each morning and visits the diabetes nurse every six months at our local doctors'. He tells me they are happy with him and that everything is okay....However, I am concerned that despite being asked to try and lose weight he doesn't seem to be able to. I have tried to cut down on the quantity of food I serve him at mealtimes and have also tried to offer healthy meals, but he seems us satisfied and will eat other things to satiate his hunger. I don't want to be a nag, (as we are virtually newly weds) and dont want to jeopardise our relationship if I keep on about his food intake, but I think he could be a prime candidate for a heart attack or stroke. He eats twice the amount of anyone I have previously known and seems to get hungry within three hours following a meal. I'm wondering if he has an addiction to food? My husband has next to no exercise, has a stressful job, works mainly long, unsociable hours behind a desk or is stuck behind the wheel of his car travelling around the country.Today on television we heard mention of a drug called Victoza being used with diabetes and that this also has appetite suppressant properties. Has anyone on this forum ever tried this drug and if so, was it successful in helping to cut down on food intake? Are there any side effects? And, does anyone know if Victoza is available in the UK on the NHS? Many thanks. LadyPink "

Diabetes,Do i need Metformin,"I am a 54yr old male of lean build, no othe health issues. Four years ago was diagnosed pre diabetic and since then have continued with a healthy diet and lots of exercise (triathlons, marathons). Went for annual check-up recently and blood sugar level came back 6.6 (I have personally tested my sugars monthly over the last four years, ranging between 5.3 and 6.7) and Doc reckons I should start taking Metformin (500mg daily) to prevent any health issues in the coming years. Not one for taking drugs and just wondering if a second opinion would be wise. I realise this dosage is at the lower end but fear of the 'slippery slope' scenario is nagging me. Any thoughts welcome."
Diabetes,Have type 2 diabetes and would like other peoples' opinions.,"I'm a 68 year old quite fit lady, and I've had type 2 diabetes for about 12 years now and feel I've handled it well, until now. I have been getting increasingly thirsty in the morning on waking, don't know why, as I feel I drink enough fluids through the day. I'm not on insulin, just metformin. My sugar was 7.4 last blood test, and my diabetic nurse said I need to get it down, so gave me 6 weeks of ""tightening"" things up to do this, which has been VERY boring, as not one piece of chocolate has passed my lips, or any other sugary stuff either! But plus I don't sleep well, only 3-4 hours if I'm lucky, then wide awake, and can't get back to sleep sometimes for 3 hours, then I have to be careful I don't sleep past breakfast time. I'm feeling it's all quite a struggle now. Does anyone else feel like this, if so, how do you handle things? "
Diabetes,Advice please,"I have a doctors app for tomorrow. I'm very nervous. I'm 31 and would say in good health, however over the past year my hair is thinning, I've had a rash on my lower legs that won't go away and itchs like mad. The past month I wake up with my arm numb in the same place and feel my fingers want to turn in. My thigh also has a dull numbness. I dipped my urine In work the other day and the glocouse reading was off the scale. My father was diabetic, though passed away at the age of 39. Any thoughts and advice would be much appreciated."
Diabetes,my fear keeps building and building...,I have posted some days ago about my type 2 diabetes diagnosis from earlier this year. I have dome research and research till the point my family are telling me to stop. But I'm starting to get really really frightened. I literally can't stop thing that I might have progressed symptoms of neuropathy and damage to me internally and that will contribute to an early death. I can't stop thinking about it. I'm especially scared because I'm just 30. And all the information I've been reading all point to at least 10 to 15 years shaved off my life span. And how everyone says they have a team of doctors. I've only seen my gp but have asked several times about how I'm doing and if I need to see different specialists. He said he would refer me to a neurologist but that's so far. I'm really sad and very frightened

Diabetes,"Diagnosed as type 2 in 2011 and put on Metformin, now told by new GP I'm not diabetic","In 2011 I was diagnosed as a type 2 diabetic and immediately put on Metformin. Got sent on a Desmond day and took my wife along with me to that. Gradually lost 2 and a half stone in weight and generally took care of my eating. More or less stopped drinking alcohol as well. Had my annual diabetes checks and was told I was controlling it very well.Moved house last December and registered with a new GP. As part of the registration process I gave my medical history and was given a date for a blood test to see what my HbA1c was like in readiness to see the diabetic nurse for a review. Had the blood test and made appointment to see diabetic nurse. When I saw the diabetic nurse she told me I was not a diabetic as my blood results were that of a normal non-diabetic person. She was unable to comment further because my medical notes from my last GP had not been forwarded to the new practice. I was told to get another blood test in 4 months time, but in the mean time to half my Metformin dose. This I did and went for the results last Friday. GP told me I’m not diabetic and to stop taking Metformin altogether.Now I’m confused. Was I misdiagnosed in 2011? My original GP who made the diagnosis told me it’s a condition for life and I must learn to live with it.Has anyone else had a similar experience?"

Diabetes,T2: Change of diet & weight-loss = significant meds reduction,"Hi all.T2, diagnosed about 15 years ago. 61 years old.Thought I'd share what's happened to my medication regime over the last 3 months following a change in diet and resulting weight-loss. It might give others some hope!Starting weight pre-diet was 17st 4lb (I've been heavier in the past).Current weight is 15st 8lb and still falling ...but still over-weight.I hadn't planned to start yet another diet but my wife decided to join Slimming World and it was easier all-round if I ate the same as she did as she's the primary cook (and a good one!). At the same time cakes, biscuits, chocolate etc., were banned from the house.Starting meds: Gliclazide MR 60mg, Metformin MR 2,000mg. Control had been poor prior to the diet with numbers like 12 fasting and up to 21 pp....After the first month of the diet I went to my GP as I was, at times, having to eat over and above the diet guidelines to keep my levels above 4 (I start to get the shakes at 5 or below). Gliclazide reduced to 30mg.After the second month I was still having hypo problems so the Gliclazide was knocked on the head completely.After the third month the Metformin was reduced to 1,000mgNow I've probably got to wait for my next HBA1C test (Jan 2015) to see if I really need any Metformin at all. I'm not sure that I do but I'll stick with it a while longer. My GP has said I should go back to her if I feel the need to. I regularly get readings in the mid 4s before lunch and sometimes in the afternoon but at least I'm not going below 3.9 anymore (assumed ""real"" hypo benchmark).I had no problems getting test strips either, even after coming off Gliclazide. The GP said she was happy funding the cost all the time I needed strips as the cost of my meds was going down as were, hopefully, the potential cost to the NHS of future diabetic complications!The interesting thing for me is that I experienced almost exactly the same weight-loss 3 years ago when I was on WeightWatchers BUT my BG readings didn't improve significantly. I can only assume the Slimming World diet is better for me than the WeightWatchers diet. We certainly eat well but it's primarily meat, fish, salad, vegetables & fruit.We also bought an Actifry machine (best kitchen gadget ever!) to allow us to have low-fat chips / roast potatoes which we do 2 or 3 times a week. So plenty of carbs!!??As to exercise, apart from all the housework (I've retired but the wife is still working) and gardening, I don't do much. Not because I don't want to but because I have problems with athritis in most joints and I'm waiting for an operation on my back. Post operation, I hope to get back out on my mountain bike!So, happy-ish T2 bunny...CheersStuartPS: All descisions on reducing meds were made by the GP based on my own readings, I've since had an HBA1C test that she said was nearly down to non-diabetic levels. I think she was more happy than I was...PPS: You are what you eat...think that applies to me anyway!"
Diabetes,cycling and diet for diabetics,I have recently been diagnosed diabetic type 2. I'm not overweight and have been a regular cyclist for more than 20 years.

Diabetes,Bananas and T2 Diabetics ,An article on the dangers sugar for the general public shows that a banana is equal to eight tea spoons of sugar.Should T2 diabetics eat them? 
Diabetes,For over 12 months I had been suffering from 'the usual ...,"For over 12 months I had been suffering from 'the usual symptoms of diabeties' such as total exhaustion, an almost constant need to urinate, incredible thirst - at one time I was drinking 6 litres of water a day - and still thirsty. I bought an accucheck and when I tested my blood sugar level it was off the scale. That is more than 33mm/ol. By this stage, I could hardly see through my glasses and a vision check showed that my lens prescription had changed from -7.25 to -3.25. Scared, confused and not helped at all by my local hospital in Walsall I was helped by my GP and a dietician at the surgery. I now take 2x850mg Metformin tabs a day. My blood sugar levels have come down to 6.2 on a fasting test. Later in the day they are about 6.8 to 7.7 which is still a bit high. My vision is returning to normal and I can see again using my old specs. In terms of how I feel- well about 200% better than before the treatment started. I have energy to do things, and almost all of my symptoms of diabeties have gone. In fact, I now realise how ill I was before treatment started. I've made a lot of big changes to my diet - loads of porridge, starchy foods and complex carbohydrates and am starting to understand more about me and this condition. Quite a few diabetics I have spoken to don't take their diabeties seriously, but they should. My dad died at 59 with diabetic complications having lost a limb and most of his faculties on his way to an early grave. Whilst diabeties is not easy to control because it requires so many changes to your diet and routine, those changes are something one has to do. I just wish someone would have spoken to me about the symptoms so that I knew what to expect. I also think that telling people to get more exercise and so on ignores so many issues in society today. People in work tend to work long hours in sedentary jobs. Local sports facilities like swimming pools are virtually non existent and massively crowded, or else very expensive. Walking the streets as a form of exercise is dangerous and so this in my opinion is one of the reasons why a lot of people become overweight and levels of type II diabeties are so high in this country. If government spent more of our taxes on making the streets safer and providing more free at source sports facilities such as gyms and pools I truly believe that they would spend less on treating conditions like this. Health is more than the prescription block in your GP's surgery.[i:210b24b26d]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:210b24b26d]"

Diabetes,Low readings in the mornings,My husband a type 1 diabetic for 40 years and at the age of 79 has readings of 16 when going to sleep and it can fall as low a 3 or 4 in the morning. Sometimes it is even lower. We cannot think of how this comes about and wonder if anybody has this problem.
Diabetes,How interested would you be in a non-invasive blood glucose monitor?,"Hi, I am a fourteen year old with type 1 diabetes and am currently doing a project on non-invasive blood glucose monitoring. As part of my project I am looking in to how useful a monitor like this would be and would really apprecaite your input. Would it make a big difference to your life? Should more time be put in to research? I would be very grateful for any contribution. Thank you so much, Rebecca"
Diabetes,Has the bottom just fallen out of my world,"I have just been told by my GP that I may have T2 Diabetes. I am having a second blood test next week to confirm. Along with all my other medical problems, I did not expect to be told this. My eye sight is fine, although I do wear glasses they are only needed for reading and computer work. I have days where I feel tired but as I have an under active thyroide, I have always put it down to that. From what I have just read, it seems it could be the diabetes that is making me tired. I do have a major problem with my weight, again not helped by my thyroide problems. What can I do. I feel so alone. I haven't even told my family yet but I know they will be devastated."
Diabetes,New to type 2 diabetes - help!,"I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 3 weeks ago. It goes hand in hand with my hypertension and although I have various appointments for dietitian, podiatrist, eye testing, bloods etc, I feel a bit confused just now. I've got tablets for cholesterol too. I want to manage these things as best I can but my eyesight is terrible - suddenly worse than before and I worry about what to eat (although presumably that will be sorted out with the dietitian. I just feel a bit lost just now. I'm a fit (but overweight) person and feel it's all a little unfair really. It's easter and everyone's tucking into chocolate eggs and I'm not!! I'm really feeling sorry for myself today aren't I? Any advice and or assurance would be very welcome at this point. "

Diabetes,Does Glucophage Aid Weight Loss?,"About 2 years ago, I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes and was prescribed metformin. My mom bought generic met, which I've been taking for almost a year. Well, i'm not religious in taking my medicines to begin with. Anyway, I was wondrin' why I haven't lost weight when those people I know with diabetes naturally lost weight. I've read that glucophage is prescribed to obese patients with Diabetes to help them lose weight. Is this true at all? If it is, what daily dosage is safe to take?Thanks a lot! "

Diabetes,Hypoglycemic?,"Evening,I have been doing some research and think I may have this. After heavy drinking sessions I often feel fuzzy, lethargic, hot and shaky . I also notice an increase in my heart rate. I have it quite bad once where I felt like passing out, however the symptoms usually dissipate after eating or having sugar. Now I don't get this problem any other time than after a heavy drinking session, perhaps when I haven't eaten beforehand. This makes me think that it's not any diabetes. However, I will check with my GP. I understand that my weekend binge drinking is not healthy for me but such is my lifestyle.FYI I am a healthy 26 year old male in decent shape and exercise 3-4 times a week. Any help on this matter would be great.Craig"
Diabetes,type 1 diabetes high glucose readings,"Does anyone else have continual high glucose readings wwhilst on insulin? If I take enough insulin overnight I still have a high morning reading, usually about 17/18. If I reduce my overnight insluin, I still have a high reading - I'm damned if I do amd damned if I don't! I rarely go below 10 - and yet I actually feel okay. Sugar is the worst for me, fat doesn't affect so much."

Diabetes,DIABETES IS A DIY AFFAIR IN SOUTH SOMERSET,"Diagnosed T2 sept 4 2010 with a gluco level of[ 25 ]the doctor did not seemed bothered at all ,[YOU WONT DIE HE SAID YOUR ON THE PILLS !I knew nothing about diabetes but i was soon to find out first thing was the doctors will not give anyone a perscription for test strips to check your gluco level ,they say it does not need monitoring by the patient !because the nhs checks it EVERY 12 WEEKS which is great if you dont fall asleep twice a week during the day ,not knowing if your hypo or hyper the doctor said you will go to DESMONDS clinc then i found out it was over subscibed by 6 weeks ,trying to get the PALS to sort it was a joke as there is a conflict of interest [they work in the pct ] on phoning the appointments office my self i find out it now turns out i cant get into DESMONDS UNTIL AFTER JANUARY,I GAVE UP. UP, Then i found out that i needed to see a podiatrist ,so back to the doctor ,yes he said you can self apply pointing me to a leaflet in the corner so i filled it in only to find out no one contacted me [i had waited 3 weeks ] on phoning them i found out that althoug they have an anwer phone it does not take messages and it was bearly audible on the third attempt 3 days later i got to speake to a woman who told me she could not give me an appointment as the woman who did that was off on sick leave and she did not know when she would be comming back ,so i left that one .With all of the government cuts the latest trend is DIY this means someone who was paid to be a pordiatrist now gets someone to organise a diy course in a village hall on how to look after your feet !Desmonds is another diy course for diabetics .Trying to get a diabetic diatitican was a joke ,it turns out she was on a contract and only came around a month .there was lot more but thats was a sample ,to find out my gluco level i went to the asda pharmacy who checked my gluco level they also checked my cholesterol level which was handy because the doctor had put me on statins ,i later found out it was routine for T2,s as every body thinks they are overweight ,me i weighed 164LBSso i stopped taking them after i looked them up.one of the sings of diabetes is weight loss but my doctor had not weighed me for 2 years !My take is this if you get diabetes get on the computer and do your own reasearch ,buy your own gluco meter [yes i know the strips cost hard money ] but the doctor is not going to let you have them ,you need to monitor your condition ,get to know your highs and lows .With the governments cut backs and doctors holding the purse strings things can only get worse :"
Diabetes,"13.8 @ Fasting, What's that all about then ?","Hi folks, on seeing the doctor about another matter it was mentioned that i could be Diabetic; a bit of a shock as you can imagine.So off to the clinic i go the following week and get some blood taken and a few other tests done. On the day i'm told the dip tests are all normal. Yet two days later when the blood results come back i'm told in no uncertain terms that i do most definitely have Diabetes.Dr says i'm 13.8 at fasting (i.e. 14 hours after eating / drinking anything).Obviously i'm a bit freaked and to be honest a bit annoyed as i have no info on this what so ever. All the doctor said was that i'd have to watch my diet and they'd keep an eye on me for an initial 3 month period; any probs and i had to go back?I have been given an appointment to see a nurse at a special diabetic clinic, but thats not for another fortnight. So in the mean time i'm kind of in limbo with no info, no idea what to do and what not to do.Can anybody tell me what this means?I'm assuming i have too much glucose/sugar in my system so that should mean i have to cut back? OR have i got that wrong and its not about what i eat or when i eat, but rather what my body does with it and how its used?I'm open to any comments, pointers to info sites, etc.Thanks in advance,JP."

Diabetes,Metformin,"I was diagnosed with High Blood pressure, diabetes and high Chlosterol all in one go at the beginning of March 2007, I was prescrbied Metformin, I was losing a stone a month in weight, although have now stabilised. I have lost 3 stone in weight, I was not particularly overweight to start with, and got diabetes because of another underlying health problem, which put me at risk.
