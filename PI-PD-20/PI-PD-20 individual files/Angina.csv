"Angina","Heart squeeze pain lasts 1 second ","Hi, all: I'm hoping for some answers or anyone thats experiencing the same.I'm a 32 year old female. with a history of heart palpitations, PVS etc. these crazy beats would ruin my days, till i got reassured they will not kill me. the last time my palpitations episodes got bad, i was prescribed 25mg of Metoprolol. (beta blocker) about 5 months ago. this seemed to help the beats a little: Reason that I am writing in the angina forum: is because about two months ago I started getting a quick squeezing feeling in my heart that lasts about 1 to 2 seconds.sometimes I will be at rest, last time I noticed it after a heavy work out, but no pain during working out. I exercise about four days a week and ride my stationary bike, cardio, light weight lifting. No dizziness accompanying the squeeze. i have had echos done, holter and blood tests all came back ok. but the sqeezing pain is new. could the beta blocker cause this? it feels like someone has a hold of my heart and is giving it a squeeze for one second. otherwise, no out of breath or dizzy feeling. im so worried i will drop dead."
"Angina","Is this cardiac?","Symptoms:*left to middle achey chest pain with activity (right where the hand would go to pledge allegiance to the flag and to the middle) - intensity changes with movement of arms or torso and eating (oddly enough)...which i don't notice until i'm at rest*Noticed a little pain yesterday in my back in the same area as the front- pain is not increased when intensity of activity increases- in other words, running or walking ...pain is the same - actually...pain went away on a brisk walk last week*Soreness that lasts for an hour or more at rest, bit goes away when laying in bed at night...with the exception of some discomfort when rolling over in bed*tenderness when I press on sternum and mid chest ...the acheyness lingers after I have pressed on it*Difficulty getting to the top of a deep breath ...feels tight...especially with activity*Occasional left breast painwhen i do get to the top of my breath ...there are popping feelings in my ribs...front and backthere is a slight increase in pain with deep breaths, but that is not constant and its definitely not excruciating by any means*i have lots of belching, throat/chest burning, and gas...but i have GERD, so i think thats separate.Tests:ECG-normalchest x-ray- normalcardiac enzymes-normalCan anyone shed light on whether this sounds like cardiac or something else? Ive been looking at other possibilities like costochondritis, as well. Hoping to have a stress test next week to continue ruling out cardiac issues."
"Angina","Chest Tightness after smoking weed","24, female.. I smoke occassionally. Never had this problem at first, but lately it's been a problem. I would get long lasting chest tightness after smoking weed. Sometimes a small headache. Sometimes I would feel something on my left shoulder/arm, and neck too.The thing is, I've had plenty of heart tests in the past. Lots of ekgs, holter monitors, stress-echos and just echos. All clear. But why the chest tightness? I'm really wondering is anyone Has anyone experienced this before and what happened?"
"Angina","Heart attack possible at 26?","Hello everyone,I'm hoping you can help me.For about 2 weeks, I have had the feeling of angina almost daily. It's usually when I do anything that requires even minimal effort, such as walking for 5 minutes. Once the feeling shows up it can last for quite some time.I'm 26, female, never smoked cigarettes, thin (about 105 pounds) and I try to eat healthy although I do some unhealthy snacking here and there. My only risk factor is that I'm quite sedentary. I haven't exercised in years.As of right now, the only diagnosis I have is SVT, which I get horrible episodes of, maybe a few times per year.The feeling I get isn't really painful, it's more of a heaviness like something is on my chest compressing it. I also get this uncomfortable pressure in my back and down my left arm along with getting sweaty, nauseous and dizzy quite frequently.I went to the emergency room with this feeling twice this month.The first time they said my ekg and blood test is perfect, and sent me home with ""anxiety"". The second time I watched my ekg print out and at the top it said ""possible minor ischemia."" I questioned the doctor about it and he said ""the ekg isn't always right and there is nothing wrong with my heart."" Again I was sent home and told to follow up with my GP.I live in constant fear that I'm gonna just drop dead. The chest pressure and dizziness makes me so worried I've been missing work and confined to my house. It seems doctors are not taking me seriously because I'm young and don't have the risk factors, but certainly there has to be something causing these symptoms...I have had horrible palpitations for years but this type of recurrent chest pain is new to me.Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
"Angina","Microvascular Angina","I have been diagnosed with Micro vascular Angina and I know it has been coming on for about 10 years but it took a while to find a doctor who agreed that was what it is.I have chest pains every time I go outside to do a little work and anytime I exert my upper body too much. I also get out of breath and feel like I have just run a mile.I had a heart catheterization twice, about 3 years ago and just this February. They are always clear and normal.I have a lot of pain and discomfort but just have to deal with it. The meds that are used for this all cause my blood pressure to go down dangerously and make me feel like I will faint if I get up. I just came here to see what others have to say about this condition and find out as much as I can about what if anything can be done."
"Angina","They can't find anything, but it's getting worse.","Hi, my name is Alex, 28 years old, Male. I am 175cm tall and weigh 57kgIn 2014 i began to feel my heart pumping even in rest.(60bpm)Now in 2020 i have problems even with light physical activities like stairs or walk in the park.I feel shortness on breath, chest pain, plapitations and fatigue.On the other hand the doctors can't find any evidence in:Coronary angiogram(never had high blood pressure or cholesterol)ElectrocardiogramEchocardiogram(only small mitral valve prolapse)24H Electrocardiogram(a couple of extrasystoles)According to the doctors i should be in perfect condition.But this is not the truth.Is it possible to have some kind of heart failure?Any opinion will be helpfull.Thank you in advance..."
"Angina","I always feel like I'm having a heart attack","I'm 33yrs old and I feel like I'm having a heart attack almost daily. I've had anxiety for about 10 yrs now and was told once in the ER that I have angina(not sure how they came to that since all they did at that time was an ekg,but ok).I have had numerous ekgs done,chest ct scan,cardiac blood work and wore an event monitor for a week,(had an echo done about 10yrs ago,but that was 10yrs ago so..). I was told I had some bouts of tachycardia,but it was in normal sinus rhythm and that everything looks good nothing to worry about. I dont get chest pain often,but i do get discomfort in my chest(mainly in my sternum area),left arm and shoulder pain,jaw pain,neck pain and upper back discomfort. My blood pressure is great in the low normal range,heart rate is usually 75,80 while resting,cholesterol is pretty good...It's interfering with my everyday life and I hate it. Everyone tells me I'm a hypochondriac and I dont disagree,but I am genuinely terrified that I'm going to have a heart attack and I cant help it. Any advice on what to do or how to not freak out?"
"Angina","IS EDEMA A SIDE EFFECT OF ANGINA?","Hi, I'm Ricardo and I'm a student at the Universidad del Valle de MÃ©xico and I'm studying medicine. I would like to know if edema is a side effect of angina and also because that edema appears.I read an article about that but I did not understand, I would like someone to help me, please. it's for a homework."
"Angina","Cholesterol and Angina.","Hello everyone!I'm a 35 year old male, and recently my doc said my cholesterol is high. 252 to be exact.Lately ive experienced angina and wonder if its a complication of this.I am exercising and eating a low carb, vegetarian diet since i got the news.My doctor did a sonogram of my heart last year and it was fine.Is high cholesterol reversible/curable?Is my chest pain a symptom of it or could it be something worse like coronary artery disease?Thank you!"
"Angina","Anxiety or Angina?","What does angina pain feel like?I swear I have some form of Angina, but my doctors gave me an EKG, stress test, all came back okay. I do suffer from Hypermania and PTSDBut everyday I have chest pain and these weird random sharp pains all over my upper body and arms."
"Angina","Is this microvascular angina or something else?","Hi All, I have been experiencing unexplained symptoms for over 2 years and wondered if there is anybody out there that can share similar experience or offer some guidance as to what my problem could be.It started 2 yrs ago with episodes of a kind of vertigo feeling. Like a falling feeling. I also suffered with a discomfort just to the left of my spine near my shoulder blade that may or may not be related. I initially shrugged it off. It happened 5 or 6 times over a 6 week period then went away for a year. Then it returned with a vengence! the episodes now came with a horrible sense of doom along with pain in the tips of my shoulders, palpitations and chest pressure. I was sent to both cardiology and the musculoskeletal unit. Cardiology had me do an echo, ecg and stress test but found nothing. MSK did an MRI of my thoracic spine but found only moderate degenerative disc disease that they say is normal. MSK did an examination of my thoracic spine and found significant stiffness in the muscle that runs down the left of my thoracic spine. They gave me exersises to do and discharged me with a diagnosis of possible T4 syndrome. By this time I began experiencing a deep aching in my back, chest, left neck, jaw and the left side of my face. This can come on at rest, last anything from 5 mins to 45 mins then go away as if nothing was wrong. i have experienced episodes of involuntary arm curling with the vertigo/doom episodes although this has only happened 3 or 4 times in 2 years and passed quite quickly. It had me feeling I was about to have a heart attack. I also began to experience a discomfort with my breathing. Feeling as though Im not getting a satisfying breath. This also comes and goes at random. I experience dizzy spells too. Over the last 12 months this has gotten worse. I was referred back to cardiology and fitted with a holter monitor (found nothing) They tested me for a pheochromocytoma (nothing) and finally a CT angiogram that showed no calcification and clear main arteries although they did say the smaller vessels could not be seen on the scan and that they couldnt rule out MVD or microvascular spasms. They discharged me with a note to my GP to try me on nitrates and calcium channel blockers to see if they improved my symptoms. My GP tried me on nitrates but they made me feel ill and I stopped them after a couple of weeks. My GP wont try me on CCBs because I am taking propanalol and says the two cannot be taken together. Since then Ive been left to suffer. No further investigations, no diagnosis and a worsening condition. In the last couple of weeks the weather has been really hot and I have noticed my symptoms are worse, difficulty getting a satisfying breath along with the usual angina type pain referal pattern. Now I also get a feeling of a knife between my shoulder blades that comes on, is really painful and then goes away in a couple of minutes. I really dont know where to turn next. Ive also seen a Rhuematologist that said he could explain some of my symptoms but not all and questioned why I had never had a invasive angiogram. He also advised me to push for the CCBs. I have registered with a new GP but I havnt seen him yet. I have lost confidence in my old GP as I dont think she knows what to do.My blood tests show a raised lipid profile. Combined HDL LDL ratio of 6.1 but my Tryglycerides are at a massive 5.7 and I have been offered nothing to help it except ""change your diet""... I eat the odd take away like everyone else but i dont eat unhealthily at all. My Ferritin levels are at 700 but my C reactive proteins are normal indicating no inflammation and I am not anemic. My red blood cell count is slightly lower than it should be but apparently not enough to account for the breathing issue. I was also B12 deficient at 172. I am on injections for this but no mention of any further tests to get to the bottom of things. I am 39 yrs old. Male.Thanks for taking the time to read this. Any opinions and shared experiences much appreciated.Thanks"
"Angina","Angina on somedays and not others","Hi,My name is Mike and I am a 62 year old male, I have had angina for about 14 years now,I have had 3 stents fitted over the years but although they probably saved my life the angina still persists.What I find odd is that some days I can be very active and do things like run,walk for miles,lift weightsat the gym and on other days I just have to get up from the sitting position to walk and bang the angina gets me.I only take nitro when it is very bad as I don't want to become reliant upon it.Anyone else out there have the same type of thing?"
"Angina","23 year old, left upper abdominal, chest, shoulder and arm pain","Hi everyone. I am a 23 year old female with a history of high blood pressure. I am on 25 mg of losartan for it. I've had upper abdominal and chest pressure solely on the left side and pain for about the past month now. It kind of hurts to breath in. I had a bout of this a year ago and was diagnosed with costochondritis. I don't remember exactly if it ever went away completely before this second bout, but I do know it couldn't have been as bad as it currently is or I wouldn't have been able to function. I have this fear that its a thoracic aortic aneurysm or heart vessel blockage for some reason. Also intermittently for the past few years, I have gotten this pinching feeling in the left side of my chest that lasts for maybe about 10 minutes per episode. No relation to physical activity or anything like that. I've always just assumed it was a muscle spasm. I've seen a cardiologist and all the tests were normal (ECG, 24 hour holter monitor, and blood tests). For my recent month-long flare of pain, I've seen a doctor and had a chest x-ray performed and blood work which were all normal. I still can't shake this feeling that something is wrong because I am so uncomfortable, and it seems to have moved up more closer to my throat in addition to being in my chest. I also am burping all the time and just feel full in my chest and like I have a globus sensation in my throat. Surely something like an aortic aneurysm would have been caught in the tests they ran, but I did not have a CT or echocardiogram done which would have for sure ruled one out. I'm probably just being a hypochondriac, but I am very uncomfortable and all the doctors do is just keep prescribing me corticosteroids, which don't seem to help. Has anyone else experienced symptoms like these?"
"Angina","prinzmetals angina","I have had prinzmetal's angina for over 7 years. Information about prinzmetal's says that pain occurs at night while in bed. Well not in my case. I get angina pain in the day time as well at night. Does anyone out there get pain in the day as I do ? I get pain at anytime, when it is cold or when I feel stressed and sometimes activity brings it on. I am taking a lot of medication for it , can't be without the nitro spray. Am having a lot of bad days lately hope to have a few good days soon.Because prinzmetals is rare I feel a bit lonely having it , even though there are people who have the usual angina. It would be good to talk to somebody who prinzmetals."
"Angina","Chest pain 20 year old","for a month or two now ive been experiencing what i can only describe as random, dull chest pains (on the left side) which last for 30 seconds ish only to dissapear again. there doesnt seem to be any pattern for them. Im a 20 year old male whose family doesnt have a history in heart conditions but i do live quite an unhealthy lifestyle- which im hoping hasnt given me Angina or anything like that. I have had my heart checked several times via ECG because of palpitations (a sort of thumping feeling) a while back and they all came back normal (my doctor said it was anxiety- which admittedly i have had, but the pains ive been having ive never had before with anxiety). Any ideas what im experiencing anyone??"
"Angina","Someone give me something","About a month ago, I began to get heart palpitations when i would lay down, they would go away after a while. A few days after, I began to get some pain on the left side of my chest a few times a day, not too strong, but i could pin-point exactly where it was. After 2 weeks of that, I went to the ER, got my blood checked as well as an X-Ray and ECG, all normal. Coincidentally that day, the symptoms began to go away, and I was fine for about 2 weeks. About a week ago, the palpitations and pain began to come back; I also started to get lightheaded throughout the day, and a bit nauseous after eating. Maybe it's anxiety, maybe it's other things. I want to hear what you guys think (I'm going to a cardiologist soon). And I am 20 years old, healthy/exercise regularly, don't smoke"
"Angina","Transmyocardial laser revascularization","My husband is having this procedure done in a couple of weeks. What are the long term benefits to this procedure? I can't find any forums where actual patients discuss their results."
"Angina","Angina","Hi, I have been getting central chest pains, sometimes in my back also. It comes and goes normally vet it once or twice a week sometimes more. I don't get breathless but it can be painful, and can last on and off for half the day or so. I notice when I have the pain I burp a lot more. It didn't feel like GERD as I know that that feels like I have had an ecg, but that wasn't when I was getting pains that come back ok. It's been happening around two month and I'm worried it's my heart, because that's what it feels like. Anyone else have my symtoms ?Thanks x"
"Angina","Angina and being tired","hi all, i had a nuclear stress test last November after having chest pains during exercise. The results came back negative, but I have had chest pain again today while gardening. I have had a rough weekend, with my other half diagnosed with a PE, we went to A&E last night and got home at 4:00am. iI have also forgotten to take my candesartan for the last 2 days. could the tiredness (and not taking bp meds) cause angina symptoms? or is it stress?any advice appreciated, i am worried about my other half and the last thing i need is bring ill."
"Angina","helath anxiety. ð","hi all.i'm a 22 year old female, mother of two. i've had terrible health anxiety for over a year now. it seemed to go away when i was on zolofy, but i'm not on that anymore. i just wanted to get this off my chest so i can calm down a little bit, because i feel so stupid ï­lately, i've been having very bad stomach issues (IBS.) heartburn, constipation, etc. my anxiety today is over the roof. i've been having weird symptoms, but try to brush them off & remind myself it's my anxiety.the one thing i've been worrying about, is my heart. i feel like i'm gonna have a heart attack!today i've been having very bad back & neck pain. but about an hour ago, i had a quick shooting pain right in the middle of my chest. & now my chest in the middle feels achy off & on. i also have a bad spine, basically.can anxiety cause this chest pain? it comes & goes, varying on the day. some days i won't have it, other days i will.if not anxiety, could it be my muscles? i just need some reassurance please. it'll make me feel 10X better! i also was diagnosed with a heart arrythmia last October, but the cardiologist wasnt at all worried about it. he said it wasn't serious enough to treat or anything.maybe my stomach issues could be the cause of this? it mostly hurts when i move or lift my arms."
"Angina","Does this sound like angina, anxiety or worse......","Hi allAbout 3 months ago had a dull pain in testicle went Drs and being reffered for US of testes which I've had today and has come back ok other than an inflamed eperdemisAbout a week after going Drs (about 10/11 weeks ago) I started getting shortness of breath and tight chested so went A&E who done blood test, ECG and chest X-Ray and all come back fine. was told it was muscular or anxiety and was merely a panic attack.Since then I have had several blood tests for various things and all come back fine other than a raised ESR (which I would assume is related to today's result of the eperdemis). Have also had a Ultrasound of my kidneys, prostate and bladder but again all come back fine. Have had a camera down my throat to check my larrynx and pharrynx but all fine. Had another ECG litetally a few days ago and again all fineHave being on a course of Cipholexen and Doxycycline whilst waiting for the Ultrasound of my testes and was given omeprazole and ibuorofen incase chest was muscular for a week but DR didn't want me to stay on ibuprofen.I have spent hours online looking at things and have convinced myself several times im having a heart attack or got heart disease so have been doctors about 10 times and seen 3 differnet doctors who tell me its in my head.I get occasional pains left, middle and right side of chest occasionally. Some weird like stitch like pain in my left side/hip area which I've never felt. I am also having light headedness daily which is annoying me now aswell as my left arm feeling heavy sometimes. Obviously dr google says these arw heart attack warnings but every doctor I have seen has saidbecause the pains come and go even when I am watching a film it isn't heartI am only 28 with no history of heart problems really other than my Grandad who passed away afterafter having heart attack.this all stemmed from going doctors about testicle pain up until then everything was perfect.I have being given sertraline 50mg and some diazepam 2mg and told to take this for a few weeks and see if it gets any better as it stands I am now on 4th day and feel worse. I have also got a CBT appointment over phone in 2 weeks time but I still dont know whether this is a physical problem or not.I have 3 children, Christmas is approaching and I am currenlty off work because of this. I am pretty scared about having something happen and leaving my partner with the children by herself. I will also add one of the doctors I been seen specialised in cardiology and has said repeatedly it isn't heart but my head says otherwise."
"Angina","Costeochondritus","Hi does anyone out there get this and if so could you give information on how it effects you, how it starts and how long it lasts.What helps to ease it and can you replicate the pain.Have you had it for years or is it a relatively new experience, have you had a diagnosis from your GP or via Google.How many of you think its a heart attack and how many believe its muscular and nothing to fear.Do you think its anxiety related or an inflammatory condition.I am asking these questions so i can write a help page for an anxiety website to try and give a better picture of this from the sufferer's point of view.Thank you in advance for your help, when i have completed it i will definitely post the article on here."
"Angina","Need some reassurance, I feel like I'm losing my mind","Ok, I thought having more answers would put me at ease, but it just brings up more questions. Let me start at the beginning:I'm 5'3"" and currently 170-ish pounds. My diet isn't as healthy as I want it to be and I don't exercise much aside from walking and riding my bike around.It started about a month ago, while I was working. I hadn't been getting good sleep because of work-related stress and anxiety, and as a result my energy levels would drop off randomly during the day and I'd feel off-balance and sluggish. One day it got to the point where I couldn't focus and I felt like I was going to pass out, along with what felt like muscle tension on the sides of my chest, under the armpit, as well as shoulder/neck tension and headaches. Fast-forward to a couple weeks ago and I keep having headaches along with sluggishness, and making frequent trips to the bathroom to calm down. Of course, searching my symptoms only made things worse for me. It got to the point where, on Thursday of this week I felt a painful jolt in my chest, right over my heart, which was preceded by what I thought was a heart attack. I was breathing quickly, I was cold and had chills, I was shaking, my muscles from my face and chest to my belly were tight and spasming. My heart rate was elevated and I wound up calling 911 because I thought it was a full-blown heart attack. Once at the hospital I had tests done, including an EKG, D-Dimer and the usual blood work along with an X-Ray. To my (brief) relief everything was in the clear, my heart is healthy and I am at little risk for a blood clot (D-Dimer level was at 450.) Now onto today: I want to believe that what I'm experiencing is work-related stress, but I still have a sore muscle on the far left side of my chest, just below the collar bone and close to my armpit, it itches when my clothes rub against it and I have headaches that won't go away, even when I'm not at work. Not only that but I feel split-second aches in parts of my body, especially in my left arm, my legs and the right side of my groin.I'm still experiencing headaches, tiredness and muscle aches on the left side of my body along with itching on the far left side of my chest, along with another feeling; something I can't describe. It happens for only a second but then I feel weird, like I break out in a cold sweat for a second and it feels like my heart is being squeezed for a split second, though I wouldn't know what that feels like. I've felt this after walking briskly. Part of me wants to believe that it's not heart-related or angina-related since I've been to the hospital, but there's a nagging feeling in the back of my head that I'm not in the clear. I need reassurances here: Could this be angina related or is it just stress/anxiety? I don't want to go to the hospital again nor do I want to die. I'm losing my mind trying to figure this out."
"Angina","Hi there :) ","Ive been having chest pains on and off for 2 years now - some days im fine and others not so fine. Recently in the last month its become a lot worse as ive visited A&E twice with an awful racing heart beat and terrible chest pains - to the point where ive felt like i was going to pass out. The Drs did all the tests on me and could find nothing wrong with my heart or blood pressure. Ive been referred to the Heart clinic at the Hospital where ive been before - as had an Echo Heart test and 24 hour tape which both came back perfectly normal last year. I think ive got Angina as i do have all the symptons but the medical profession are dubious to say that is the problem - i know i need medication but finding it hard to get diagnosed. Has anyone else had this problem as im worried if it does get worse i'l be having a heart attack when i could have had medication to help. Thank you for any comments.

"Angina","Chest Pain and Fatigue: Angina or something else?","Hello, I've come here because recently I've had no one to turn to about this. For around a month I've been experiencing sharp, sudden chest pains or discomfort in the center or left side of my chest. It will sometimes come from physical activity or when I'm at rest. I have Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, which has one of the main causes of death in patients as a type of cardiac issue. However I have no family history of any heart disease. The pain has also come shooting down my left arm and hand, and sometimes I get sudden pain in my ankles. A few nights ago, I woke up from a deep sleep to my heart beat racing and pounding in my ears and chest. With the exception of that event, my usual blood pressure is normal or just above average, but not exceeding any higher whatsoever. I am not quite sure how to deal with this currently, so I'd like to know if there are some things we couldn't rule out or pay more attention to.Thank you.Hello, I've come here because recently I've had no one to turn to about this.

"Angina","fell, shoulder xrayed, pain under breast now think it could be angina.","Fell, left shoulder xrayed at hospital, pain from arthritis in shoulder, but on leaving hospital had chest pain around heart, thought it might be a fractured rib. Am due to see a orthopaedist in a few weeks, probably for cortisone injection to shoulder and knee, but after coming here am beginning to think angina. Will make a appointment tomorrow with my internist. Taking a adult aspirin immediately and one every day until I see him Tried to avoid all pain meds except on skin.. Now I realize the shoulder pain could be part and parcel of the angina as well as the chest pain. Considered going to the ER again this a.m. but held off thinking I'll call the internist tomorrow first thing. My knees went a while back so I have been unable to do any real exercising for 2 months, which is pool just as well. Only doing water walking and hot and cold pool at the YMCA no bycling or walking except to stretch the injured knees. I was aware of the shoulder and chest issue but was ignoring it before the fall. You don't always take pain seriously at my age which is 82. People say I look 20 years younger, so I pooh, pooh my condition to myself, figuring its better to be positive than whiney. Now while I'm not afraid of death, I figure I best take better care of myself. People where I live are dropping like flies, though it is supposed to be active adults over 62. Family tend to die in their 80's, mother at 89. Everyone buys the farm sooner or later. Prefer it to be a bit later. Brother died of strokes in mid 80's.

Family tend to die in their 80's, mother at 89. Everyone buys the farm sooner or later. Prefer it to be a bit later. Brother died of strokes in mid 80's. Am glad I checked in here, haven't for a few years. I appreciate this site."
"Angina","Angina and Depression?","my 94 year old grandfather has had angina since age 55. His mood is low. He seems to want to die. Do GP's have a duty to assess sufferers for depression? Is there guidance on this?The 2 conditions seem to go hand in hand so I am wondering what the duties of medics are in assessing depression.The poor old gent also has been suffering for many years with bronchitis (probably as a result of pipe smoking).I am grateful for any info.

"Angina","Viagra for Angina","I was diagnose with clogged arteries over a year ago. I even had a stent put in because one of my arteries was ecluded. I still had stable angina every time I did some for of cardio activity or is I ate something with sodium. I started using Nitroglycerin patches and even have the pills just in case my angina episode occurs. I had a date and I read online that you can't take viagra and any nitrates cause it can drop your blood pressure really low. So I stopped using my nitroglycerin for about 48 hours so I can take the Viagra. I noticed that I wasn't having chest pains a few hours after I took the viagra. Then I didn't have angina for over a day. Once I felt a little chest pain, I took another viagra and no angina. I've been taken viagra for over 2 weeks and no angina. I even have been doing cardio with no chest pain whatsoever. I told my cardiologist this, but she says that it was not good and I should stop immediately and start using the nitrates again. But she didn't give me a good reason to stop. I have no angina whatsoever. I was wondering has anyone else tried this? If so, have you found any pros or cons? I can't find anything and I've read that viagra was originally to prevent angina. I want to keep taking the viagra but I don't want to damage the heart either, Help please. Thanks"
"Angina","Only 1 episode of chest pain yet told he has angina. Now going for angiogram and possible stents","My husband had an episode of severe chest pain when working abroad. He had been swimming 'hard' for 30 minutes or more and giving all he had. A friend took him to hospital where they decided he had angina. From that day he has been taking meds but has had no pain (despite ignoring the Dr and going back to swimming - just not quite as hard as he had been). On return to UK our GP reduced the number of tablets he was on and he was still fine. Tomorrow he is having an angiogram and if necessary stents. I am finding it really hard to accept he needs this intervention as he has had absolutely no problems before or after that one episode.

Feels uncomfortable and has a ticklish-like feeling, like a tiny bit. The pressure or discomfort with the kinda-ticklish-feeling wants to make me cough. This type of discomfort in the chest is similar to the discomfort you feel with palpitations.This discomfort usually happens at night, but also at day. It's hard for me to sleep and keeps me a little worried.I'm just wondering if this is angina.I also think I've found the culprit to this discomfort.I sit on my chair playing games and watching stuff for hours. I've recently found out that doing that can 'cause serious heart diseases. I've been doing that for about an year or so.Maybe that can be the reason, or maybe not.This discomfort is unbearable, it's just so annoying and uncomfortable. If this is perhaps dangerous, please let me know. I've went to my cardiac doctors, and they say my heart is fine, but that was about 4-5 months ago. Just please, I'm worried. My mom says that worrying and anxiety might be the cause, but I really don't have anxiety much. Almost none.Just for a reminder, my heart feels uncomfortably funny.

Itâs about a 5 min walk and has a few small hills and inclines. I usually get out of breath (which is normal for me) and i am carrying some extra bags other than my purse. The pain lasts like a literally a split second and then itâs gone until I walk back to my car after work. I may get 2 or 3 quick jabs of pains during my walk. At times the pain can take my breathe away because I dont know when its coming? I get no warning its coming or radiating pain? If i try to press my ribs i donât really have any pain?

"Angina","Angina / CAD","Six weeks ago, my husband had chest pains and was taken to the emergency room. There they did ECGs and blood tests over a period of 18 hours, but nothing abnormal was detected. He was discharged home and told that he would require a heart stress test. My husband has type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and cholesterol. All these conditions are well controlled with medication and he has lost 2 stone and has been told that he is now classed as non diabetic. He exercises regularly, has never smoked but there is a family history of heart disease.Two weeks ago he went for the stress test, but they did an ecg first and refused to carry out the test as there was a concern about the T waves. Not sure what this could mean.We saw a cardiologist last week. He said we could go through stress test and echocardiogram but ultimately, he felt it best to go straight through an angiogram, describing it as the gold standard. He said this would be better than a CT angiogram,It is now 6 weeks since his chest pains and he has had no pains or discomfort since. There has been absolutely no signs of angina on exertion and my husband has been carrying on doing workouts since, with no ill effect,My question is, would he have experienced heart pain since, if he has Coronary artery disease? Seems strange that he has had no chest pain, no breathlessness whatsoever. Is a lack of symptoms normal in CAD. Just hoping it was a virus or pulled muscle in his chest. Incidentally, he also has asthma, for which he uses a brown/ blue inhaler.Your thoughts would be appreciated. His angiogram is only 2 weeks off, but it seems like an eternity. Had to cancel our holiday and I'm a teacher, but health comes first. Many thanks! "
"Angina","28 years old with chest pain in left side and left arm ","for the last two days Iâve been having chest tightness and pain in my neck and my left arm and left side of my chest. Seems to be worse if Iâm lying in bed or resting. Got a ecg which was normal but Iâm pretty high up there when it goes for risks of heart disease. Iâve smoked for ten years but stopped recently I have high cholesterol. Iâm over weight, I have high blood pressure and thanks to depression Iâve been more or less bed ridden for the last 4 years. My father just died January 4th of a massive heart attack and Iâve had anxiety since then but it wasnât untill 2 days oago my chest and arm started hurting kinda like a dull ache or pressure and then like pain going down the back side of my left arm pretty much everything is isolated on the left side. At this point Iâm going on itâs either anxiety which Iâm also taking xanex for but doesnât seem to be helping so at this point Iâm thinking itâs either that or unstable angina do to the sudden onset of the issue and cause itâs worse when Iâm resting mostly at night or early early morning. Of course Iâm not a doctor so what does everybody else think ..... if anything itâs pretty safe that I have heart disease of some degree "

"Angina","Stomach pain every time heart rate increases","I'm 39, normal weight and I used to be quite active.But for the past 2 years every time I do something to increase my heart rate, my stomach hurts. And it will hurt harder and harder if I don't stop. And it can be exercise or recently even just having an argument and talking.But the pain will go away completely in 2 minutes if I stop, or just decrease my movement so the heart rate can go under that number.Back when it started I needed to increase my heart rate over 150 for my stomach to hurt.But if I slowed down my running and got my heart rate at 140, even if I kept running, the pain stopped in a few minutes.It's the same now, but that number went lower and lower.And it kept getting worse and now the moment heart rate is over 100, that means walking, my stomach hurts. And it can hurt quite bad if I keep walking and I don't stop.I did tests like EKG and another test I think ultrasound, where they move a small device over my skin and they can see on a screen what's inside. And both the gastro and cardio doctors said everything appears normal.Except for the systolic murmur which I had since I was young and the cardio doctor said it's absolutely no concern.?My blood pressure is normal.For the gastroscopy the doctor said he saw no problems inside my stomach except for a slight redness.To add more details, a year ago the gastro doctor gave me Domperidone which is a pill to make the food travel easier through the stomach. This helped a little immediately, so the pain instead of appearing at 120, appeared a 130, it was a mild improvement which helped for a few good months. But slowly it progressed and now it's worse.Anti-acid pills have absolutely no effect.For me it loos like some type of angina, but what kind of further tests can I do to convince the doctors ?I've read on internet that there are multiple types of arterial problems and they can be localized in the heart and legs. But maybe they can be localized also in the stomach ?"

Treatment went well. Fluid is virtually gone.But I continue to have symptoms. Chest pain, left arm, shoulder, and wrist pain, jaw pain, numb/tingling lips, neck pain, back pain, left face/ear pain, dizziness, and nausea (no vomiting). It seems to happen whenever I move, but itâs generally sporadic.I also learned that I have MVP and regurgitation (cardio didnât tell me. I asked for a copy of my last echo results) but both of these conditions are very mild. I was also diagnosed with high blood pressure (currently awaiting appointment with endocrinologist) but my medication (Metoprolol) is doing a great job in managing it. Iâve changed my diet as well. My cardiologist is at a loss here.I recently went to the ER (for the 100th time these past handful of months). Once again, they found nothing. Standart ER tests were normal. I was not monitored, however.Iâve had probably 30 EKGs, 10 echos, so much blood drawn that Iâm probably anemic by now, dozens of chest x-rays, 3 holter monitors, and a stress-echo all normal. Iâm waiting on a CTA in Feburary, but Iâm worried about my symptoms and is wondering if I should get this test done asap.Indeed, I also have a mental health history. GAD and depression.

My Blood Pressure is always normal.But sometimes at least once in a day i feel tingling and pain in my left arm and chest accompanied by shortness of breath.P.S: I also smoke about 6 to 8 cigarettes a day."
"Angina","Coronary Artery Spasms","Ok I have had this condition for years, some cardiologists agree with the diagnosis and a couple do not .Cut a long story short, last week I was out shopping, I had sudden crushing chest pain and felt really ill , had a spray, rested for 5 minutes and was able to able to continue on even though I was still feeling very unwell, the chest pain kept returning and it got to the stage where I just do what I usually do, grit my teeth and put up with it, as I was out had no other pain relief. Finished the shopping went back to my mothers to install a new telephone for her and then came home, I was then able to take my prescribed pain relief, after an hour I was pain free. Five hours later it all started again so back to using the GTN, this would help but for no longer than 10 minutes, I followed my cardiologists instructions in this case, after 30 minutes pain was still there and GTN was pretty much useless and I was still feeling quite unwell, I decided to call an ambulance, their ECG machine showed a normal tracing , however on the way in the machine started carrying on, alarms going off every couple of minutes, it had the paramedic a bit confused I think because it was telling him I was in VTAC, which in laymans terms means I was flat lining to which I wasn't, the machine was telling fibs then further down the track the machine went off again and told him something else was going on, once again if the machine was accurate with what it was telling him I would be dead. We reached the hospital their ECG showed nothing, had blood taken for troponins, waited for the hour and then I was called in and told I had to have a repeat, I asked what the first trop came back as, I was told 22, second test came back in at 31, doctor was happy to send me home, this was early hours in the morning, like 2am. I had to call an ambulance again around lunchtime that same day, once again ECG showed nothing, troponins done again, was called back in and told I had to have another repeat test, first one came back 32, second one came back at 32, this doctor was also happy to send me home, that night I ended back in our emergency department again that night which ticked over into the early hours of the morning, ECG done again, all good, took more blood for troponins, first one came back at 45, once again second test was done and that came back at 40, no explanations as to why it was up after me asking what was going on with me, was told they don't think it was cardiac related so sent home again. By this time I was sick of going back and forth to the emergency department and I just kept the pain under control with my pain medication. 2 days later I had to go back in with same chest pain and associated radiation pain, you know all the normal angina symptoms, I was still feeling quite unwell, I called for another ambulance, arrived at the emergency department, ECG normal still, bloods taken, first troponin came back at 49 this time so had to have repeat troponin, that came back at 49 as well, that was Ok, even though it was relatively high from the cut off point it wasn't increasing this time. I asked questions and was given the same answer, they don't think it was cardiac related, although I did have one doctor say that angina attacks can raise the troponins, but I wouldn't of thought that high ??I understand the basics of troponins and I know with the machine they use the cut off point is 14 for any kind of event, now from what I have understood from my cardiologist, he has stated that troponins are heart specific enzymes and are only released when the heart is in distress, like slowly being damaged or quickly damaged depending on how high the numbers are. I also know kidney function/failure, infections and pulmonary embolisms can raise troponins amongst a few other things, now I had nothing like that wrong with me, although I am recovering from a pulmonary embolism, I had more test done about 4 weeks ago and was given the all clear of a PE, it had disappeared, the clots had all gone, so I am assuming that could be ruled out as a cause for the troponin rises. My cardiologist said to me several months ago when the clot was found and my troponins were sitting around 20, he told me that the PE was only secondary to the troponin rises, because as I stated above as to what he said, troponin is heart specific, so the way I am understanding it, at that time when I did have the embolism it was putting strain on the right side of my heart in turn releasing concentrations of troponin, basically the heart was being put under strain and injuring it to release the troponin. What I can't get my head around is now that the troponins are almost double and they insist it's not cardiac related ? How does that work, does it sound right to any of you ? any kind of input or experiences would greatly be appreciated. I feel like I did when I have had previous NSTEMI's, quite unwell and feels like I have been hit by a bus. I'm still experiencing intermittent chest pain, even as I write this, it maybe another trip into emergency if the pain returns after the pain relief wears off. Ok I have had this condition for years, some cardiologists agree with the diagnosis and a couple do not .Cut a long story short, last week I was out shopping, I had sudden crushing chest pain and felt really ill , had a spray, rested for 5 minutes and was able to able to continue on even though I was still feeling very unwell, the chest pain kept returning and it got to the stage where I just do what I usually do, grit my teeth and put up with it, as I was out had no other pain relief. Finished the shopping went back to my mothers to install a new telephone for her and then came home, I was then able to take my prescribed pain relief, after an hour I was pain free. Five hours later it all started again so back to using the GTN, this would help but for no longer than 10 minutes, I followed my cardiologists instructions in this case, after 30 minutes pain was still there and GTN was pretty much useless and I was still feeling quite unwell, I decided to call an ambulance, their ECG machine showed a normal tracing , however on the way in the machine started carrying on, alarms going off every couple of minutes, it had the paramedic a bit confused I think because it was telling him I was in VTAC, which in laymans terms means I was flat lining to which I wasn't, the machine was telling fibs then further down the track the machine went off again and told him something else was going on, once again if the machine was accurate with what it was telling him I would be dead. We reached the hospital their ECG showed nothing, had blood taken for troponins, waited for the hour and then I was called in and told I had to have a repeat, I asked what the first trop came back as, I was told 22, second test came back in at 31, doctor was happy to send me home, this was early hours in the morning, like 2am. I had to call an ambulance again around lunchtime that same day, once again ECG showed nothing, troponins done again, was called back in and told I had to have another repeat test, first one came back 32, second one came back at 32, this doctor was also happy to send me home, that night I ended back in our emergency department again that night which ticked over into the early hours of the morning, ECG done again, all good, took more blood for troponins, first one came back at 45, once again second test was done and that came back at 40, no explanations as to why it was up after me asking what was going on with me, was told they don't think it was cardiac related so sent home again. By this time I was sick of going back and forth to the emergency department and I just kept the pain under control with my pain medication. 2 days later I had to go back in with same chest pain and associated radiation pain, you know all the normal angina symptoms, I was still feeling quite unwell, I called for another ambulance, arrived at the emergency department, ECG normal still, bloods taken, first troponin came back at 49 this time so had to have repeat troponin, that came back at 49 as well, that was Ok, even though it was relatively high from the cut off point it wasn't increasing this time. I asked questions and was given the same answer, they don't think it was cardiac related, although I did have one doctor say that angina attacks can raise the troponins, but I wouldn't of thought that high ??I understand the basics of troponins and I know with the machine they use the cut off point is 14 for any kind of event, now from what I have understood from my cardiologist, he has stated that troponins are heart specific enzymes and are only released when the heart is in distress, like slowly being damaged or quickly damaged depending on how high the numbers are.

"Angina","Could this be Angina!","Hello, I am 53 and female. I have been seeing my heart consultant for a couple of years now as I am having trouble with my heart. I was born with very mild Pulmonary stenosis that doesn't affect me in any way. They have also found that one side of my heart is a bit stiff so doesn't pump the blood out as good as it could but again this is mild. My heart dr can find no reason as to why my heart beats so fast, why I suddenly come over feeling very ill for no reason at all... I have to lay down and its such a terrible feeling of being ill I just can't explain it but its horrible and I have to just rest until it passes which can be hours!Also If I eat a heavy meal, or if I go to a restaurant and have a meal and a glass of wine, I can barely walk afterwards as the discomfort is so bad, I can't breathe because i'm so breathless and my heart feels like its actually being crushed, and my heart races wildly, after one meal one evening I took myself off to hospital because my heart was just under 180bpm and I thought I was going to collapse, but still no one knows why it does this. I was kept in Resus as they were so concerned I was about to have a big problem I.E. heart attack or cardiac arrest....I can't remember what they said.Now I've started to experience this awful chest discomfort when I'm excited ( how ridiculous) or if i'm worried/scared. Its a bad discomfort in the main heart area, spreads to the middle of my chest and goes through to my back sometimes, it is also below the left breast. I come over really tired, weak and I feel a bit breathless only if I get up and exert myself. It goes on for an hour or two, I just again have to lay back in my recliner chair and wait for it to pass. I am now wondering if I have angina! My heart dr says there is nothing else wrong with my heart apart from what ive wrote above....she feels the fast heart is because I'm unfit ( I don't get any symptoms on exertion ).

"Angina","Dizzy and light headed all the time...","Anybody had dizziness that was caused by coronary artery disease?I was diagnosed with angina about 3 years ago,my main symptoms being breathlessness when climbing stairs and pressure in the chest when walking uphillAt that time I had some bouts of slight dizziness that came and went.Well my condition has deteriorated since I retired...I am now 65 and lost my job 2 years ago and feel I have really gone downhill.I am always light headed and unsteady on my feet to the extent people think I am drunk.Obviously I have been to my GP but the best she could suggest was low levels of vitamin D after ruling out Parkinsons Disease and inner ear problems.Well just today I have had my worst ever angina episode brought on by pumping up a bike tyre.I normally do not suffer chest pain (i have a nitromin spray but have only ever used it 2 or 3 times experimentally) but this time I had central chest pain and was very short of breath.It brought me to my knees and really frightened me.I honestly thought I was having a heart attack.So in my mind I connected the dizziness with the onset of new and alarming angina symptoms.Anybody with experience of dizziness that was directly attributed to angina?"

Need advice on what i should do.","So to make a long story short i am a heroin and cocaine addict on and off for 8 years been clean for over a week now, bout a month ago i started experincing chest pain that progressed to neck pain that progressed to jaw pain shooting pain across my shouldere and down my arm and headaches had a few small realapeses on heroin only and noticed whether i was using or not im still experincing these pains. I did go to the hospital but they said my ecg and blood work was fine and attemted to do a CT scan but the contrast they injected me with missed my vein so they werent able to get any resutls. Ive also had an echo and stress test and said they were going to send the results over to my doctor but he never got them but the nurse did say they didnt see any thing alarmiing when they brefly reviewed it. I saw my doctor recently and said he belive it probably was angina but kind of put it off and said to follow up with him in a month. Knowing this is probably angina should i go back and demeand that he refer me to a cardiologist or am i just stressing my self out about something that will probably go away over time? I dont know what to do any more and feel this pain every day with horrible headaches and it doest seem to be going away. "
"Angina","Newly diagnosed Angina - holiday problems!","Let me say first and foremost that I KNOW my health is a priority and I will always put that first.I am however frustrated with how things have progressed with regard my Angina diagnosis.I initially saw a GP with specific chest pains back in July after already booking a 2 month holiday to Aus/NZ starting Feb 2017. Initially my GP prescribed me antacid medication and recommended a basic ECG. At the time I was pretty confident that this wasn't the cause and as the pain only started when I walked I also didn't think a basic ECG would show anything.Fast forward about a few weeks and I see another GP in the surgery who asks more detailed questions about the pain and symptoms and just as I had thought he believed I had Angina.After a lost referral letter I eventually saw a nurse practitioner who told me I was low risk but put me forward for a heart scan and a stress test (ECG) I told her about my planned holiday and I got 'I am sure it will all be ok for February'. So my planning continued.Now, months later, I am waiting for an angiogram/Angioplasty with a possible stent needed as the stress test showed an issue.Having contacted my insurance company and then the consultant only to be told he would not give me a fit to travel letter.I have just started medication and goodness knows how long the waiting list is for the procedure, I have been told it could be 6 months.I haven't cancelled yet as I am hanging onto the hope that if it is sooner rather than later I may still be able to go on the 7th February.While my consultant is rather nice, I don't feel I can ask too many questions as his last comment was 'I am a cardiac surgeon not a clairvoyant' when I asked a 'what if' question.Am I living in cookoo land to think there is still a chance I can go?Also, will I ever manage a long haul extended holiday again with a doctors permission.Feeling a bit depressed about it all to be homest and just wanted to talk it all through.Any advice would really be appreciated.Let me say first and foremost that I KNOW my health is a priority and I will always put that first.I am however frustrated with how things have progressed with regard my Angina diagnosis.I initially saw a GP with specific chest pains back in July after already booking a 2 month holiday to Aus/NZ starting Feb 2017.

"Angina","Just venting.... ","Anyone else in my position I'm sure would be really happy right now. But instead I just feel filled with pure frustration!!! I had an echocardiogram on Tuesday the result was normal and I even managed the exercise without any pains!!! This is what frustrates me. As for nearly a year now I have not been unable to walk 4 steps sometimes let alone exercise. Standing, cooking the smallest of tasks set me off. For months I felt my life had changed beyond recognition. And my symptoms scared the living daylights out of me. About two weeks ago I was put on a medication that lowered my blood pressure more, but didn't agree with me otherwise. So since then, even though I had to revert back to my old medication, I have started to feel so much like my old self. I have had little to no chest pains and feel a lot better. But I just feel like someone is messing with my Mind! As soon as I have to have a test I start to feel a little better. This does coincide with medication changes admittedly. But it just makes me feel like professionals won't believe me, or my family. I'm just so upset!!!I'm really sorry if I offend someone who is constantly battling. I don't mean to be ungrateful for feeling better. I'm just so confused by how my body responds. I would really like to understand this. I may apparently have microvascular, or just bp problems that cause chest pains. But I feel sad that until 2 weeks ago I felt debilitated. Lost my job in the process, and now im ok. No explanation!! Like I say, I'm just venting no need to reply x"

I stay fluidly activfor as I get almost 25,000 steps a day. Played 4 years s of college basketball, wait gained after basketball.Married, kids, love my job. I had a messed up child hood and have always been a person with anxiety.About a year ago I had an episode were I felt light headed, heart was racing, left arm pain, so I went to the Er. Everything checked out. I had several more of these episodes and ended up at the er 2-3 times. Everything checked out fine. I went to a cardio doc did ekg, stress, echo, and 24 hr monitor. Everything checked out fine (a trace of a leaky value) which the doc said it wasn't a concern. That started a bunch of test, acid reflex test etc. I felt like I was losing my mind and even went to Mayo Clinic! Again they said heart was fine, put me on anxiety meds and that has seemed to help.I still get chest pain on the lift side which tends to be in a specific spot. It feels better when I press down on that spot. Another concern is I feel short of breath sometimes but have Asma and being overweight doesn't help. Sternum also hurts with movement. Any ideas?"

"Angina","Dull lingering ache after chest pain ","Hi does anyone else get a lingering dull ache after an angina attack? I have microvascular angina. Sometimes for hours/days after chest pain, I will have an achy feeling around my heart. It kind of feels like my heart or at least a muscle is strained or overworked. I mentioned it to a couple of doctors and they have been very dismissive about it. One even said at A&E you can't feel pain from your heart. I then thought then what is angina pain then? Anyway, I just wanted to know if this dull lingering ache is a different kind of problem from my angina. Maybe even inflammation or something. My blood pressure or high pulse rate can trigger an angina attack. I'm going back to work on Monday after nearly a year off. I'm a bit anxious I won't cope. I spoke to Cardiologist about working and doctors, they all say I will be fine. This baffles me because up to now I haven't been fine and I am triggered by minimal exertion, stress amongst other things. So, in doctors minds medication can control angina to a large extent so long term prognosis is good. Yet I haven't been stable and usually 5 days out if 7 I have chest pain. I ended up in A&E on Wednesday. Just wondered if I am setting myself up for a fall if I return to work too early? Thanks for any help x"
"Angina","I thought I was having a heart attack!","Yesterday, I woke up at 245am with a pain in my left jaw, a feeling like someone was kicking me under my ribs at my heart, my heart was beating fast and hard, I was nauseous and I was having a hard time breathing.

I was laying in the fetal position expecting my heart to give out at any second. The spasms under my ribs made it impossible to breath normal. The paramedic gave me 4 baby aspirin and 1 nitro pill which temporarily caused all the pain to stop. It would start all over again every few minutes. The morphine they gave me in the e.r. didn't help at all. I had a cat scan with contrast and an MRI done. The doctors told me I didn't have a heart attack and they were puzzled as to what happened. Even asking me if I could've had a panic attack or acid reflux. I've had both but this was NOTHING like that. Has anyone else had this happen to them?

The paramedic gave me 4 baby aspirin and 1 nitro pill which temporarily caused all the pain to stop. It would start all over again every few minutes. The morphine they gave me in the e.r. didn't help at all. I had a cat scan with contrast and an MRI done. The doctors told me I didn't have a heart attack and they were puzzled as to what happened. Even asking me if I could've had a panic attack or acid reflux. I've had both but this was NOTHING like that. Has anyone else had this happen to them? "
"Angina","Prinzmetal angina","I was diagnosed with prinzmetal angina about a year ago, after having 3 heart attacks. I am only 37 years old. I take diltiazem & mononitrate pills & nitro patch as well as nitro spray. I have episodes so often. They hurt so much. The most painful ones are when the pain shoots up to my head (instead of down my arm) It literally feels like head is going to explode.some days are really bad. Like today, it's only 11:30am & I've had 6 attacks already. I hate having this disease & it'd only been a year & a half. I can't imagine having this for another 20-30 years. was also diagnosed with fibromyalgia almost 10 yrs ago. Plus I started early menapause, which they believe was brought on from my heart attacks. This has all caused me such depression. I always question how I will continue living like this. I have 3 kids that are my whole world & an amazing , patient & loving & undurstanding partner. If I didn't have these 4 people in my life I don't think I would still be here. I'm having such a hard time trying to get through each day. I have tried researching prinzmetal but there really isn't much to read. I wonder if this is something I'll have for the rest of my life? Do each attack I have cause damage to my heart? Is there medication out there that will work better then what I'm already taking? Could I have genetically passed it on to my kids? Are there vitamins I could take to help (& some that may help my fibromyalgia or early menapause) I've never met anyone with prinzmetal so it would be really nice to talk to someone that feels my pain. Anyways, that's my life in a nutshell. I hope to be able to chat with others, like me. To anyone taking the time to read this, thank you!! â¡"
"Angina","Microvascular angina ","Hi, since my nitrate medication was increased my symptoms and triggers have changed. Beforehand either my blood pressure and or pulse rate were raised from minimal exertion and this would trigger chest pain. Or it could be triggered by stress. But I also always at least got neck pain.Now I am a bit better, but fatigue is a major issue for me. When walking particularly I feel as though I could lay down on the road side and sleep. Just feel so tired!My pulse or blood pressure are not always raised when I get chest pain now. Does anyone else get chest pain without problems with pulse or blood pressure issues?I don't always get neck pain now. But when I do it usually comes on before my chest hurts. If it's bad I use my gtn before the chest pain kicks in. Does anyone else do the same? Should I wait to see if I get chest pain before using gtn spray? I also get pain in my stomach now when I get angina pain which is new for me. I am only on nitrate tablets and have a gtn spray. I might be put on Verapamil eventually but this may not be for another month yet. Imdur helps but shame after a while it stops working. Anyone else on nitrate tablets that work for a while then stop? They keep increasing the dose for me, but wonder if you think I would be better in the long run being put on calcium channel blockers such as Verapamil?Thanks! "

"Angina","Heart rate down to 35 (or less) after a spray of nitroglycerin. Is that unusual?","hiI'm 44 and have been experiencing centre to left chest pain for the past four and a half weeks. They started one evening and have gradually got worse. They now normally radiate to my upper back and down my left arm. I'm also getting abdominal and hip pain that may or not be related. I've been on Omeprazole on and off for the past year for abdominal pain that may or may not be related. The pains gradually seem to get worse through the day and are generally worse between 8-12 pm.Last Saturday night was the worse they've been. I called an ambulance and the paramedics said my ECG was slightly different to the one on record. They gave me a large aspirin and a spray of nitroglycerin. It's was the strongest hit from a drug I've ever had, I felt dizzy, nauseous and couldn't stand up. When they got me in the ambulance they said my blood pressure was very low and my heart rate was 35, they'd never seen that response before. I'm assuming my heart rate might have been even lower when the TNG was having it's big effect on me. My question is, as I don't know what's causing my daily chest pains, does a large drop in heart rate in response to TNG suggest anything? Or is it actually not that unusual. Thanks. "
"Angina","ISOSORBIDE MONONITRATE high blood pressure","My doctor decided to put me on isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg once daily to treat my hypertension. I had tried all the major groups of medications and couldn't get over the side effects. Calicum channel blockers made me retain water in my ankles and feet. Water pill caused my gout, legs to ache. Now I'm on a nitrate. People at work think I'm crazy for trying a nitrate to lower my blood pressure. My blood pressure was 160/108 the other day. What do you think? Should I end this experiment before it starts?"

However, they has only ever been 2 diagnosed heart attacks. She has used GTN in both tablet and spray forms for years however it seems to be failing now.

"Angina","Possibly Angina, but not 100% sure.","Hello,Sorry for posting such an undetailed title. About 3 weeks ago I went to my PCP for tightness in the center of my chest that I had for about 3 days. I could still play sports and the pain didn't bother me, which I thought was odd. I noticed that this pain started after having a stressful weekend. I told the Dr. that it felt like it was GERD and he told me to take some over the counter medication and I had a virus-(since I had a very low-grade fever). I took the medication and it didn't seem to help. So I went and got some low dose aspirin and that made the pain go away within about 30 minutes.I am a little over-weight-(about 35 lbs), and I am on cholesterol medication. I have been taking the low-dose aspirin every night since this pain has happened. I have been taking my BP about 3-5 times a day for a week and have been averaging 128/80, if that helps? There are times where I don't want to do anything at night, so I just eat dinner and lay right down, and then go to sleep about 3 hours later. A question I have is if it is angina, then how do I stop that scary pain from happening again, and what do I need to do make it better? "
"Angina","Could i have angina?","Hi everyone, I'm a 33 year old male and being a male I tend to avoid the doctors and hide my weakness.For quite a while now at least a year my health has been suffering. I can become very fatigued at random and for no apparent reason I can even be sat down watching tv and boom this feeling of total exhaustion hits me like a truck. The scariest part is the chest pains. I get 2 different types of pain the first one is the least pain full of the 2.Pain number one occurs to the right of my heart and to the left of the centre of my rib cage. This pain can only be described as an exploding pain. It starts in one spot and spreads out but seems to stay centered around my heart.The pain is fairly mild kind of sharp and can sometimes feel like a pushing sensation. On a scale of a 1 to 10 it's about a 5 it's more scary than painful.Pain 2 is the worst and more than once I have genuinely thought my time was up and I was going to die. This pain starts in the centre of my chest and builds. It feels like a tight compressing pain that will travel up my neck, down my left arm and into my back and sometimes even my jaw. It can be extremely scary.I have tried taking ant acids such as ranitidine etc and they do nothing at all I just have to wait for it to pass.About me, I am over weight ideal is 83kg and I am currently 122kg and have been overweight most of my life. Heart disease is in my family my granddad died from n stage heart failure. I did used to smoke but gave up many years ago. I have not lived the healthiest of life styles to be fair.I can not think of any triggers as such but I have had a tough time with family issues over the last few years and stress has been high. Stress can bring on pain sometimes but it can also happen when I am resting. I have been woken up by pain 2 on occasion as well.My doctor has done tests recently for thyroid function, blood pressure, resting ecg all of which are normal. But these pains are real they are scary and I know that something is not right.I would like to know what sufferers of angina think to my symptoms? Is it worth asking my doctor to investigate this as a possible cause?"

"Angina","Can momentary stress cause angina pectoris?","Hello to you all. I have read and researched about angina pectoris before coming here to ask questions. But I need some further clarifications and I believe you would be able to help me here.Say we have a 69 year old female with cardiac problems since a kid and diagnosed with hypertension/high blood pressure, than it is pretty common to ""evolve"" into angina pectoris. High blood pressure seems to be among the major causes/high risk factors along with prolonged psychological stress, high levels of cholesterol. Our subject - the 69 year old female had all this - high blood pressure, long term stress, high levels of cholesterol. My question here is a bit odd, but please be kind - I need to know if a single stressful occasion could cause angina pectoris to such person who was already predispositioned to the above-mentioned conditions. A few years ago, during an argument my mother splashed my aunt with hot coffee. The coffee was hot like very warm, but not burning hot. What my mother told me was that after being splashed with the coffee, my aunt leaned back and sat on the couch - did not faint or anything like this, but seemed shocked and not feeling good for a short time. But after half a minute or something stood up and started cleaning the coffee up, then went in the garden to do her her choirs, but was probably very angry and still very stressed. She later shared she wanted to do something in order to relieve the stress, anger and offence her heart was full of. Then she came back and went to bed where she staid for the rest of the day. She was feeling sick and staid in bed the whole second day as well. After weeks or a month aunt went for her regular appointment at her cardiologist and was diagnosed with angina pectoris. She has been relatively well since then , though I little older hence with some additional health problems, but moving, walking, going out, doing her house work. Her documents say angina pectoris - unclassified - the doctors have not bothered to determine whether it is stable or unstable, it is not her major issue with health and she has even achieved some good things like lowering her blood pressure, etc. The thing is my mother became obsessed whether she is guilty and to what extend about her angina pectoris. It is possible that back then aunt was not going each month for her regular medical appointment, so the angina might have occurred before their fight, but could be afterwards too. And if it as afterwards, do you think such single occasion could be the direct cause of the angina pectoris? Just like if you assault someone they could immediately have a heart attack, let's say? My mother feels guilty because she sees the coffee splashing equal to a physical harm and different then their frequent and severe verbal fights they had at that time. I know she did not to a good thing, but her guilty conscious is recently soaking all her life powers and it hurts me so bad! I am researching this with the hope to give her some facts so she finds some peace. Aunt does not care aboutthis,but my mother is depressed now, though she was not tkinging about it these eyars until a few months ago. So do you think this occasion could be equal to physical assault and harm to someone, or it is more like the stress cause by verbal fights? And do you think this could've been the last bit that led to angina pectoris?Now, I was already advised in another forum on the very same question that the cause of angina is the plaques that are built for years, etc. - you guys know way better than me the explanation. I had read about those plaques of course, but by that time I didn't know if they could be the only cause. So this explanation left me relieved. Bun then I dug in a little more and the physician that was replying on my post compared heart attack with angina - he said that the mechanism of triggering both is the same and now this didn't sound very good to me. The physician meant that even in cases of heart attacks (strokes too) the conditions are already set and it is not the physical/psychological stress that causes them, stress is only a trigger and that the same goes for angina. However, if it is the same for angina, this sounds to me like even though my aunt had the plaques angina could have been avoided. And he said that some people have all the conditions for angina and heart attacks, but are just very lucky and get away without one. He inssisted it's not my mum's fault - if it wasn't the coffee, it would've been something else. But still this may have been the trigger, he said.And in another forum they just told me - no way, man, angina is a condition caused by a gradual deterioration in the blood vessels which supply the heart. These changes do not suddenly occur but take years to develop.So what's your take on my query? Like for example, what is the nature of the triggering process of angina, or there isn't really a moment of triggering... I am aware of what causes angina, so it's just the triggering I worry...Thank you a lot in advance!"

I also have high blood pressure and am on Losartan. Over the last couple of weeks on and off I've noticed a vein in my neck bulging and you can see it pulsing. I also had pain in this area on the left hand side of my neck. I went to A&E and they did an ecg and were happy that my heart was not in trouble. Is this a problem for anyobe else having a visibly bulging and pulsing vein in neck thats also hurts a bit? Many thanks! "
"Angina","Worried possible angina?","For the last month I have been dealing with what may be anxiety related pain.I am a 21 year old male who apparently judging by the tests is quite healthy.This all started when chest pain came on while I was at work. It was stabbing and caught me off guard. I immediately panicked thinking that this could be something serious. I got in with my doctor the next day who diagnosed this as a muscle strain. Next day the pain moved more into my back and now I'm having painful upper back pain and chest pain have for the last month. The pain is more on the left side of my body which is even more scary and is a achey pain. I offten feel extremely tense and almost have a choking sensation in my throat. My chest feels tight when I exhale and don't immediately inhale. The acheyness is pretty constant but it seems to agrivate it when I get up and move around. I have tried hard to remain calm but still find myself obsessing over what this is as it is really playing into my life. When I go out with friends I find myself worrying about if it is heart related or something serious what would happen.I have had multiple tests done including:Lymes diseaseFull blood countThyroid blood testSED testECGChest X-rayVitamin D deficiency test.Fibromyalgia pressure point testAll of these have come back perfect. So apparently I'm healthy? My doctor told me this last week he has checked off the list and thinks these pains could be a double edged sword of anxiety. Where I am scared this could be something else and that is making my pain worse. He prescribed me cymbalta and I have been taking that for the last two days. I understand that takes time to kick in so I don't expect instant results. Just wondering if this seems like it could be angina related or if I am just over reacting. In total I've seen more than one doctor now and been into the doctors 6 times over the last month.Thanks."
"Angina","I'm a young buck, only 20 years old and I'm a little scared.....","I am a young athletic male only 20 years old and I am in my early testing for Stable Angina. I don't have a family doctor so I am forced to use a walk in clinic meaning no specific doctor is handeling my case. This also means no one is telling me anything about why this is happening to me, leaving me to edjucate myself on the matter.From what I understand from the research I did and from the tests I have already done I am confused and scared because I don't understand why or how this is happening. Sorry in advance for the long post I will try to keep this as detailed and organized as possible.I have done bloodwork, I had a Echocardiogram and an ECG both while I was relaxed and not showing symtoms. They came back clean and I am currently waiting to do a stress test.Angina is lack of blood flow to the heart and most commanly occures in people over the ages of 35 do to plaque buildup in the coronary arteries, in youth this is mostly caused by birth defect.So why didn't defects or plaque show up in my Echocardiogram?If they didn't find plaque in my Echocardiogram do I need to worry about heart attacks or strokes?The bloodwork should have ruled out thyroid problems I think right?And the question that is scaring me is, why is this happening now? For the past 3 years I was at the top of my fitness level. I could run for hours on end and carry backpacks that weighed as much as me without any problems. I was young and tough and nothing could stop me. Now I can''t even walk to my local grocery store without having to sit down and rest.My symtoms started this summer during a workout. It was just a routine workout I've done plenty of times before. I got dizzy and ignored it and eventually passed out. It has been downhill from there. I've tried doing light workouts but every time it gets worse.My symtoms are shortness of breath, throbbing heart, dizzy, fatigue. My upcoming stress test will probably comfirm an irregular heartbeat.My symtoms happen every time I eat large meals, drink heavy, and do any kind of physical labor. (Bassically whenever my heartrate goes up)I did a workout recently in an attempt to bring on another attack because my stress test is a couple months away and I got impatient. Now I can't even stand for more then five minutes without feeling symptoms. I'm worried its delveloping into unstable angina. I don't even understand how it can.The medical in canada is free but its taking so long to diagnose me. I can't work in my current condition, I can't even eat without having to rest for 2 hours. I have lost all of my muscle mass and I now weigh 135 pounds standing at 5'9"".If anyone can answere my questions or give me advice it would be greatly appreaciated."

"Angina","What does angina feel like?","I have been having some chest 'pains' for a couple of weeks. I have been seen at A & E and also the rapid chest pain clinic where I had blood tests and ECG's and was told that everything was normal last week and that I was 'low risk' but that they would send me to have a CT Coronary Angiography but my appointment is not until the end of May.I don't get the pains every day and they are not always the same. They come on if I am doing nothing (but usually after eating). It sometimes feels like someone is holding and squeezing my ribs with a bit of heaviness and a strange sensation goes across my chest sometimes up the back of my neck to my head and under my jaw or like my sternum is being pressed hard and the pain is there. The feeling is almost like when you get embarrassed and feel yourself flushing but a bit prickly. It's not painful compared to having babies and root canals or gallbladder stone blockage. I do have costrocondritis and have had gallbladder problems in the past (a failed operation to remove it so they put slits in the duct for stones to fall through if there were any). It is making me very anxious which obviously won't help matters. I've been told angina is excrutiating and I would know about it but I can't help worrying.

Mine started as an anxiety feeling and fluttering of my heart and shortness of breath. I was and am very fit my heart rate anything from 43 to 56 beats a min. I have no colesterol sugar blocked arteries or heart conditions issues. I was stil going to the gym recently till this week when I got extremely tired very quickly. The only symptoms I am currently experiencing is nausea every morning and low energy and the tiredness in any activity. Which is weird when I read all the other comments on symptoms you guys experience. I have been on calcium blockers and beta blockers with both I experience horrible side effects. I have tried all sorts of natural supplements. That have worked well till recently. I have used hawthorn berry, valerian root..mistletoe.. taurine..magnesium. CoQ10... Pantethine...L.Arginine.. But like I said feeling nauseas and low energy and struggling to excercise is a daily battle. I am really down and out..not sure what to try next..perhaps to give the calcium blocker another go"

"Angina","My story....","Now 64 years old.Over 20 years ago started episodes of extreme shortness of breath when climbing stairs.No chest pain. Because of my history of non smoking,normal weight and regularly cycling 200 miles per week was not considered a cardiac case.But over the following years the s.o.b. became progressively worse and despite actually collapsing at the top of 2 flights of stairs and being hospitalised over the weekend still was not considered to have a heart problem.Anxiety was mentioned as a possible cause.Any sort of heavy exercise literally brought me to my knees ,gasping for breath.I actually developed a phobia about stairs because of the distress they caused...I had to change my dentist because the surgery was on the 1st floor and when I was nervous I could not manage one flight.Well I had many E.C.G.s,Chest X rays but still no heart diagnosis.My job was not too strenuous but if I lifted something heavy I got pressure in my chest which took some time to clear.Well I moved home and now live in a hilly area and that is where my problems increased.Walking uphill I got terrific pressure in my chest which disappeared very quickly on the flat.It did not hurt .......just like having massive wind.Anyway I presented myself at the doctors with my symptoms and to cut a long story short ,after a scan was given a diagnosis of angina.But still no chest pain.However the breathlessness is a massive problem.The spray I was given does not help-in fact if I take a dose before exertion it makes the problem worse.I also seem to get fatigued very easily and suffer terrible dizziness.My life right now is pretty miserable in many ways.My meds are Lipitor 20mg per day and aspirin.I had to give up sex years ago because of the s.o.b.Would love to have a stent or two but not sure if that is the answer."

"Angina","120/75 pulse, 99% oxygen, exercise easy, can I still have angina?","I'm a 46 years old male.-Run 10 km a day 5 times a week-120/75 pulse- 99% oxygen-No smoke- Drink Very little- Sligthly overweight at 82 kilos and 169 cm- Have pretty bad anxiety- Have intermittent GERDI have been having chest pains and weird sensations in my chest for years. Always thought it was anxiety. But now I read stuff on the internet, and it seems like stable angina...This week I started having symptoms after very little effort, I'm talking one flight of stairs, walking in a shopping mall, even pacing in my appartment back and forth a few metters can trigger it.The feeling lasts about 1-3 seconds, like ""woosh woosh"" feeling. It sits right in solar plexus and upper chest in the middle. Now what confuses me...is that running 45 minutes or swimming 20 minutes doesn't create symptoms. (well sometimes running may...but might only be anxiety, it sure doesn't stop me, all I have to do is think about something and the pain goes away).These only occur with very short exercise.I'm panicking here, I'm a Canadian living in Thailand, no family here and very few friends...I looked online and stents are like $20 000 EACH...even in Thailand....there is no way I can afford that...I am screwed? Really worried about my future here.Thanks "
"Angina","Recently diagnosed with Angina","Hi, I had an angiogram on the 3 May and was prescribed Bisoprolol 2.5 mg, Atorvastatin 40 mg and aspirin 75 mg daily. I didn't have a stent inserted. Since the procedure and taking medication I have had a really heavy head, some dizziness and a painful neck. My doctor suggested stopping the statins for a week to see if they are causing the problem but I still feel the same. I have been taking 20 mg of Simvastatin for a number of years (Type 1 diabetic) and have never had any problem with those. Also, is it ok to do gentle swimming now? Look forward to hearing any suggestions. Thank you."
"Angina","Should we be worried ?","Advise please - hubby had three stents put in three blocked arteries last September, apart from the shock at the time as we had no idea things were that bad things havnt been that bad. Occasionally he has the odd random shooting pain but has been checked and told all working fine. He has drug eluding stents. Last two days he's been feeling dizzy and actually fell over today - also complained of bouts of palpatiations and feeling as if heart ' flipping around '. He flatly refuses to go to A and E to be checked and want to see how things go, I think he needs to be checked but he's scared as when he had his first two stents inserted with angiogram his heart stopped for 47 seconds. Third stent was fine with no problems. I keep telling him I want to ring the hospital but he gets very angry with me and says he will refuse to go to hospital if ambulance arrives. Any ideas of why this is happening ? He was last scanned and had X-rays around six months ago and all was well."

Hospital of course are well aware of this and have said they will be very cautious theses things happen etc ! What I would like to know is how will they stop this happening again and if it does will he be ok - we are dreading it and he is very very worried obviously , I know he will be in a safe environment etc but it's still a frightening thought - is there anything different they would do to stop this happening again as they don't seem that concerned, unlike us."

Long story short hubby been having chest pain, also across his back into left arm and jaw , GP refered him to hospital , had blood tests etc decided on angiogram so went in for it yesterday. Whilst doing procedure his heart stopped so chest compressions and then completed with stent in artery. This artery was 90% blocked, two more arteries 50% blocked , next step heart scan to decide weather to place in more stents or to operate and do a heart bypass. We are in total shock as had no idea things were this serious, he is still in hospital ( he's 51) and I will be making my way back in there soon to be with him. My question is has anyone experienced anything like this and if so could guide me through the next steps, all very scary and worrying as totally unexpected. Thanks in advance.

"Angina","Prinzmetal angina","Hi all,Let me start by saying I'm so glad I have found this group is thought I was on my own with this.Right 2 years ago I was diagnosed with prinzmetal angina after having a attack whilst having a angiogram previous to this I was in and out of A&E like a yo-yo with chest pains and all the tests showed clear ecg and bloods until one episode a specialist visited me and noticed a problem with the top of my heart and wanted to investigate further hence the angiogram. I was given ibosorbimononitrate and gtn spray these seem to help and I started to lead a normal life up until now a couple of days ago I was watching TV with my wife in bed and I had the most severe attack which lasted 2 hours I managed to ride it out using my spray and asprin, the next morning I felt ok until I was out and then I had another attack so my wife took me to A&E they did the tests found nothing wrong but gave me morphine to relive the pain which it did but morphine is horrible sicky feeling.So I was kept in placed on a heart monitor and I keep getting the attacks but these do not show up on the tests and I'm sure all the nurses think I'm putting it on even though I have been diagnosed with it.one nurse even said she has worked here 12 years and has never heard of it. I'm 37 years old and at my wits end my quality of life at the moment is horrible I've gone from being active to being a recluse only going to work and then having to recover. I've tried veramapril but this made me woosy so I'm not using it. I just don't know what to do anymore or who to turn to I feel so embarrassed going to hospital as I'm sure they think I'm a hypochondriac. The only saving grace is I have a brilliant wife and mum who have always believed there was something wrong but when I get these attacks I get nasty with my mouth as I am in pain most of the nurses think I suffer from panic attacks but this isn't that.Any advice would be so welcome."

"Angina","Angiogram","An angiogram has a stated risk (NHS website) of 1/500 patients having a stroke or heart attack during the procedure. That does not seem very safe to me, especially as these figures do not take account of perforated blood vessels, reactions to contrast dye or heavy bleeding at wound site.I was told by my baffoon of a cardiologist that 'I had JUST ABOUT convinced him that I was a candidate for an angiogram. When I asked why he replied that he was putting me forward as I am a smoker. I have not smoked for 23 years. I do not drink, my weight and cholesterol is within normal range, I exercise and have a healthy diet. I also have hyper alderesterone and a GP who refused to treat my high BP for several years as he said I was 'Doing it to myself.'The result?Eye sight and possible heart damage and now being bullied into having a risky procedure on the whim of a consultant who thinks I am a smoker when I am not. Hardly inspires confidence.Have asked for a ct angiogram or just for the opportunity to discuss why this is not an option in my case but am met with 'It was the consultants decision and he must have had a good reason for making that decision''Now the Endocrinologist is insisting I have the angiogram before he will proceed with further treatment for the hyper alderesteronism.I suppose they have to their develop their skills for their private patients by practicing on someone.Source(s):Anonymous Eve Â· just now "

This clinic are refusing to see me and have put me on their general list with a wait of about 6 months despite the fact that I have a learning disabled care plan in place that specifies every consultation be treated as a emergency because of my anxiety and because the autism can mask or muddle the symptoms often not showing their true extent.I now find that I am regularly getting a ""total power switch off"" to my left leg causing falls and these take longer and longer to improve.

I have also had a feeling in my chest like a small electric shock.I spoke to 2 pharmacists who suggested angina.I went to my doctors today and they did an ECG which was normal - so he wouldn't even discuss whether it was anything else.

It was a late ""emergency appointment"" and they were running behind on time....Could this be angina or should I just accept that it's musculoskeletal and do what the doctor said and just take pain killers...!Thoughts appreciated!Jacqueline"
"Angina","PAF and Prinzmetal angina","I'm 68. I take sotolol and aspirin for the PAF and nothing for the Prinzmetal, but have Glyceryl Trinitrate to put under my tongue as and when needed, but I've not had to use them. I don't get much problems with the Prinzmetal. However, due to my age and being female my doctor wanted me to go on warfarin, but I'm not at all keen. He therefore sent me to the hospital to discuss the matter with the haemotologist. He has told me about 3 different tablets I could take: Pradaxa; Xarelto; Eliquis. I don't like the sound of these side effects either. But I think I'm going to have change from the asperin as it is just not as effective as warfarin or the new tablets on offer. Is anyone else taking one of these tablets and have you experienced any particularly bad effects? I eat fairly healthily and expercise twice a week at the local leisure centre. Don't smoke, but like a glass of wine with a meal."
"Angina","I've just been diagnosed with Angina.","After a couple of months suffering with what I thought was indigestion, my GP sent me for an ECG, then informed me I had Angina. I'm 66, but have never smoked, only drink occasionally, and apart from having a sweet tooth have a quite healthy diet, so this came as a bit of a shock. I am taking aspirin, and have a Nitromin spray. However I'm confused as to how to deal with the symptoms. I can go for a few hours and feel fine, usually when indoors. Then feel a bit of discomfort, though not actual pain, and now and then actual pain in my chest right collar bone and neck. Do I use the spray when it's just uncomfortable? Or wait until it's actually painful? The Nitromin gives me a headache and slight giddiness, so I don't want to use it unecessarily. I'm seeing my GP next week for advice, but would appreciate any helpful feedback now."
"Angina","Prinzmetal angina ","I'm curious how many with Prinzmetal angina take l-arginine supplement and if so how much and has it helped. Also how long have you been taking it? "
"Angina","Post Angioplasty/Pill problems - Irregular pains","12 months ago after having an Angioplasty op. where I had three stents fitted, one week later I was woken up with pains just under my ribs in the centre of my chest. this has carried on during the year varying from daily up to two months between these events.The pain level is about 6/10 and allways occured 8 hours after evening meals and dissipated after four hours.I had around 7 tablets for around 6 to 8 months and then this was cut down to 3 tablets, I believe that the tablets are causing this problem and they are Dispersible Aspirin 75mg, Simvastatin 40mg (which I had changed to try to stop the problem) and Omeprazole 20mg.During a conversation with a cardiac freind, he told me that his wife and sister had similar problems as me and changed the Omeprazole for a similar tablet as the capsule casing was causing the problem not the drug inside, they changed from a blue/orange capsule to a yellow one, sounds silly but could be correct.Does anyone out there know any better? I would be very greatfully if you could respond. I am really fed up that I have to suffer for nothing.ThanksRoss"

"Angina","Morphine Sulphate Tablets","I broke my back during army service and spent many years on one different pain medication after another,none of which really helped me at all..I was finally refered to a good pain management specialist and he changed my medication to Morphine Sulphate tablets,the change in my pain levels dropped by over 50% almost over-night and I went from taking up to 15 tablets a day to just four."
"Angina","thought plz, about possible angina","hy im a 18 year old female, ever since i was about 9 ive have been having sharp pains in my chest on the left side, when i as this age the pain only happened about once every few months but as im getting older the pain is getting more constant, i have a sharp stabbing pain in the same place constantly every day, i went to the doctors about this in march and they told me i had ashma, they prescribed me with the blue and brown inhaler, these dont seem to help and my symtoms fel like they are getting worse, i went to the doctor again and she said that its possibly just breast pain, know i dont know about you, but i know the difference between the two, i feel like m not being treated fairly and that im not being listened to, it is really frustraiting and i dont know whats wrong with me."
"Angina","my dad has stopped taking the Statins!","My dad has been diagnosed with Angina and he has been taking Aspirin & Statins (plus a puffer thing when needed). He has convinced himself that his Angina is not serious and he is not willing to take Statins because of the suggested side effects in the news. My dad basically doesn't like taking tablets full stop! I am really worried that he is not taking the Statin's and I was wondering what I should do to encourage him to start again or atleast discuss it with his GP. Obviously he is a free-spirit, so it is up to him, but I feel I should let him know the risks so he is making an informed decision. He is 69 and hasn't had anything serious like a heart attack or stroke, but he has an Angina diagnosis for about 5 years.How can I encourage him to reconsider his decision? Surely his GP wouldn't put him on Statin's without good reason!"
"Angina","Newly diagnosed angina sufferer in need of moral support","Hi, AllJust got back from the cardio today and diagnosed with angina (narrowing of an artery I think).Doc wanted me to stay and have a angiogram, but let me home with the proviso I'd immediately start on meds. Wants me to take the test soon, though (which I intend to).My symptoms were being out of breath and really felt quite bad when taking the treadmill test.I'm 72, but a non-smoker and teetotaler and I'm really quite floored by this news (and more than a little anxious and depressed).Any help or advice appreciated by other sufferers."

"Angina","How angina affects quality of life","I am a second year medical student who is writing an essay on the impact that angina has on patient's quality of life. The individual that I am basing this study on said that 'Angina has had the biggest impact on my life. I can no longer go for long walks which I used to love and I do not feel confident driving long distances. I feel exhausted and frustrated when I can't do all the things which I used to...' Has angina affected anyone elses quality of life in this way?"

"Angina","I have been suffering with 'cardiac syndrome x' for the ...","I have been suffering with 'cardiac syndrome x' for the las 7 years.I was initially told there was nothing wrong with me at my local hospital, when i went there with chest pains and pains in my left arm. I innitially thought i was having a Heart Attack, with the severeness of pain i felt, but was told i could return home and run a marathon', thank god i didnt . I knew there was somthing 'not right' within my body, so i sought private medical attention, which led to my first Angiogram...this showed, 'normal' corinary arteries. ..i was sent home, and told not to worry, but was not told exactly what was wrong with me..so..consequently continued to worry that i was having a heart ttack every time i had symptems..which were often. I then asked my gp to refere me to a better hospital, as i refused to spend more on private medical care...which he did. i had yet another angiogram done, which again showed no blockages in the larger arteries..this time, the consultant said it 'could be' due to the smaller arteries being narrowed..but it was not caertain. i was advised by her to look up 'Angina ..without coronary artery blockage' on the 'internet' and told to get on with my life. which i did..for a while, then things were not improving and i was on drugs for angina and collesterol. so my gp reffered me to yet another hospital..which was a specialist heart hospital..a long way from where i lived, but i didnt care. After seeing a consultant, (who, may i add was less 'pompas' as others i had seen) he sent me for lots of tests which i was not offered at other hospitals, and on getting the reports, and seeing my destress which my condition was causing me..he asked if i would allow him to do yet another Angiogram procedure , so he could define for himself exactly what was going on. At first, i was very apprehensive about having another Angio...as i had a bleed with the one previouse,,and the first one , i had a doctor, who couldnt get into my artery properly, which led to my having groin/leg pain for 6months after. The consoltent aggreed he would do the angio himself, and have me stay overnight, as the journey home was so far, and i was concerned for another bleed. I had this done. and he confirmed my main arteries were ok..and said not to let anyone else do another angio on me. he also confirmed it was indeed my smaller arteries at fault, and gave me another drug to go along with what i was already taking. I cant say i feel any better, i dont, somtimes the pains are excrusiating, now with added back/stomache pains also. but this hospital has for the last two and a half years since the procedure, kept an eye on me every 6 months, instesd of just sending me home to go it alone, without support. I am now looking for some kind of support group in or around the London area, as with this condition,i find it is beneficial to have as much support and understanding as you can get..i do know this, my condition is worse when i am under any sort of stress. so i also think relaxation groups with this condition in mind would be beneficial to me and fellow sufferers..I was in my 40's when i first had the symptoms of 'syndrome x' now i am in my 50's I am open to all sorts of help and support anyone reading this could offer, as i am sure lots more fellow sufferers and there families would be. Thank you for taking time to read this. i hope it will be benefitial to others . Take care, and god bless x[i:945737fdb2]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:945737fdb2]"
"Angina","Further investigations yet?","I 'm 66 and have had Type 2 diabetes for about 2 years, and hypertension for about 6, also raised cholesterol. My untreated BP was around 180-200/110-120 - so not good! Back in 2007 I was getting quite a bit of chest pain and was investigated, but with treatment my BP fell to around 115-130/65-80 and I had no problems. (At this time I was not diagnosed with diabetes. I have had a mild cardiac murmur since childhood, but this is considered insignificant.There is a strong history of hypertension - both parents had it severely, several aunts and cousins were hypertensive and died of heart problems. My father had several heart attacks from age 60 and died of left ventricular failure. My mother had congestive cardiac failure.Investigations in 2007 ECG Treadmill stress test Radio-isotope stress test - very slight narrowing of LAD, but considered insignificant Echocardiogram - mild left ventricular hypertrophy, presumably from BPOver the past couple of years my BP has been rising, with my diastolic consistently above 85, and I was surprised that my GP only made one change to my medication. This last couple of weeks the chest pain on exertion or stress has returned, sometimes radiating to my neck. Yesterday my BP was 145/95 and I asked if I could add propranolol - also for my essential tremor.I should like my BP to be below 130/80 as I have diabetes and a the above family history of heart disease.My cholesterol is slightly raised at around 5.5. I had to come off simvastatin because of muscle pain, and was changed to bezofibrate 400mg daily. I've not had a cholesterol reading since then.My blood glucose and HbA1c have been good.Current main medication: Adizem XL 120mg daily (diltiazem) Lisinopril 20mg daily Propranolol 40mg twice daily (added yesterday) Bezafibrate 400mg daily Metformin 500mg twice daily Isosorbide mononitrate 10mg daily, increasing to twice daily (from 5 days) GTN spray as requiredMy GP was unsure whether to refer me again today, but we agreed to see how things go with the added medication and review in a month, or earlier if there is no improvement.Does this seem reasonable?"
"Angina","hi im waiting on having an angiogram done at the moment ...","hi im waiting on having an angiogram done at the moment and am so unsure how to handle things. im living in terror of this every day, I dont know whats wrong. i was admitted with chest pain, had all the tests done as i had a family history, they all came back clear. cholesterol was a bit high 6.5 i then had a heart scan done in london at great cost, and this showed zero calcium in arteries. i still get the chest pain mainly on the left side now especially when im under duress or stress. i take the aspirin and statins and wait in fear every day. anyone else relate to this please? im so grateful to have this site to put my feelings down and maybe meet someone else experiencing the same horrors. i cant believe how hard it is to get advice and information.[i:4279d06ba4]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:4279d06ba4]"
"Angina","Hi, I have just been let out of hospital and have been t...","Hi, I have just been let out of hospital and have been told I have unstable angina, and I have had a silent heart attack ?? I find this so hard to believe, after one hour in the emergency unit, I was fine and was wanting to go home.My story is, I came home for lunch from work and went to make a cup of tea when I felt an ache in my left shoulder, I knew I also had heart burn as I suffer from it and took some antacids but then my neck and jaw felt very tight and I felt light headed, then felt sick. This took a step up 3 times over 15mins until I felt very sick and felt my jaw and neck was in a head lock and so asked my husband to take me to the emergency hospital. In the hospital my heart rate was fine but my blood pressure was slightly up, they took a blood test and said they would keep me over night and take more blood which they did, they told me my first blood test was normal but the next showed enzimes consistant with a heart injury, they then asked me if it was ok to tell my mother who had phoned that I had had a heart attack??? I was shocked? no one said I had had a heart attack, I had no chest pain at all???I am 44yrs old and awaiting an angiogram. This is so unreal I feel so well, I was in hospital 3 days and went back to work straight away as I am a self employed hairdresser and xmas is such a busy time, I carry my spray for under my tongue. I feel a fake & think my doctors are wrong I never took drugs before, now I must rattle with them.Is there anyone who can identify with me .. I am told this is denial.. I feel really well... I smoked up to 30 a day.. now down to 4 or 5 a day, I know I must stop smoking but I'm so stressed out. my mum runs the rehab unit for heart patients, she has had 3 heart attacks and I won't go, she also is the secretary for the heart support unit and I won't go. I am really trying to give up the smoking but it's so hard because it's all so unreal.. Is there anyone who has had like me above who I could confide in and know what I am going through?? juls.[i:6095fead10]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:6095fead10]"
