"hernia","Hiatal Hernia and Panic Attacks(Need some insight)","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hiatal-hernia-and-panic-attacks-need-some-insight--636044","Hello all!Before I begin:-No history of cardiac issues(done around 4-5 tests, all clear)-GERD for several years(Diagnosed 3 years ago)-No particular family history aside from late 60s diabetes and high blood pressure late life.-20 years old male, no drugs, no smoking, no alcohol, healthy diet-Only real issue? Stress and sensitivity. I've been suffering immensely due to an unknown illness. It'd cause long term tachycardia, general panic, insomnia, clammy cold hands, the whole slew of things. Generally what your body says when it wants you to know something is very wrong. I'd be fine one moment, and then suddenly have a weird feeling in my chest(turns out that was my hernia being pushed up from a stomach spasm) and then have a panic attack slowly come up. Of course, it's my body reacting to this, so it wasn't diagnosed as an SVT. I've had ALL the cardiac tests. Holter, Stress, Echo... You name it. I legitimately thought too many times that I was going to die suddenly and no one would know what was wrong with me. My heart would race and sometimes feel like it was going to just stop. I never passed out, it never happened without a precursor of panic(so if the tachycardia comes up SUDDENLY, like 90 to 160 in a couple beats, it's likely a cardiac issue). I starved myself in fear of having even more issues, but it turned out that it made it far worse. After year of being sick like this, the symptoms seemed to subside and disappear. I was fine for a while. I could run, do whatever with no issues. Then one day, it showed up again. Mysterious. I'd have runs of the same panic, the same chest pain, the same acid reflux...I took all the damn tests, but it was a hernia. The doctors demanded I take a CT to make sure, but I prefer not to have a huge dose of radiation at only twenty. I went to a chiropractor and had my stomach pulled and it got rid of all my symptoms immediately. All those 150-160 BPM panic attacks, all those sleepless nights, all those times when I swear I was thinking I was going to die... I'm far more sensitive than normal people. I notice things wrong with my body much more clearly and feel much worse. No one understood what was wrong with me(I had telltale signs of a hernia even then, back pain, chest pain, belching, acid reflux). A hernia that was missed by endo-scopy obviously isn't that big of a deal, right? Wrong. My hernia isn't permanent. It straightens itself out and cramps up repeatedly. It can come and go, but it comes with a vengeance when I have long term stress or if I stress my GI.The point of this isn't to say that doctors are wrong, or that you shouldn't trust them. It's just that if you want to be healthy, you have to do your own research and find your problem if the fixes aren't working(this sadly happens more often than not). PPIs made me feel worse. My stomach spasms cause hernia and this hernia makes me feel god awful like I'm going to die(panic attacks randomly). I'm having bouts of my hernia again, but when I use my chiropractor's method of pulling my stomach back down, VIOLA! No panic, tachy's gone, feelings of dying are gone. Stress is a killer for any disease for the stomach. A lot of people say that ""stress doesn't cause problems with health"", but stress affects the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system. It slowly breaks that balance and makes everything spiral out of control. The body's a well oiled machine and one part that breaks makes the whole thing stop working. The final thing I want to point out is that although there are set definitions out there of symptoms and various things for various illnesses, DO NOT TRUST THEM 100%.Everyone's body is different(if this is hard to understand, think of it like this; everyone's minds are different, right? So obviously, the way they handle things is definitely going to be different!). They may be the same anatomically, but the way they react to certain drugs and the like is VERY DIFFERENT. The was the main issue I have with the current healthcare system. Far too many times do people have horrible reactions to different medications because of misdiagnosis and drug rejection from their bodies. Some people experience heart attacks like they're chest discomfort and some people experience them like it's the end of the world. Some people don't even noticed GERD and some people have straight up freak-outs that are chalked up to anxiety. That aside, how is everyone doing with their hernias? Hernias generally are considered ""untreatable"" aside from surgery, but even to that, I find that a good lifestyle with activity can hold back even diabetes. I still get bouts of breathlessness(one in the middle of the night when my stomach is completely empty, but a glass of water tends to fix it quite nicely), but it's significantly better now that I know what's wrong with me and can get a hold of my own health. I'm just curious, how many of you hernia sufferers have felt this before? I feel like I'm the only one who has such violent symptoms from what I've seen. Thanks and good luck with your road back to health!-Dan"

Was having some abdominal pains and back pains a few months ago for which I had MRIs and they were normal. Had a CT scan a couple years ago which showed a sliding hiatal hernia (couldve been a barium swallow...cant remember). Started having trouble getting a deep breath in this last week (that I am constantly yawning to get one), fullness on left side of upper abdomen, and getting upper chest pains, belching, bloating. Had an EKG, chest xray, and cardiac ezymes- all normal. Almost feels like my diaphragm is irritated. Doctor prescribed an inhaler because I had described it as a feeling of resistance or constriction at the top of my breath. She thought it might be allergy related asthma. This is not feeling like asthma to me...or at least what I would think it would feel like. I have no wheezing either. Kinda feels like there's a cracking or popping feeling in my lungs on occasion at the top of my breath, but it could be my ribs. The inhaler has seemed to make all it worse. I can breathe better, but it causes more chest pains, makes my lungs sore, and makes my bloating and GERD worse. This last year has been a totally new experience with the IBS and GERD stuff. Ive had more gas, pains, and bloating then I've ever had. I've also experienced the difficulty getting in a deep breath...but this is a whole new level. It's slightly better in the morning after a BM and I can breathe a little better, but its still there. Anyone had this with a hiatal hernia? Trying to figure out what this could be. It came on very suddenly...and no...its not corona. Thanks in advance for the response!"

I have bilateral inguinal hernias diagnosed last year, 2019. I want to have these repaired before the matter becomes urgent and I have no choice as to how I want them to be repaired.I have been looking for a no mesh repair surgeon in Australia but its like looking for a needle in a haystack. I have only found one in Sydney, Dr John Garvey and wonder if anyone has used him?I saw one surgeon in Brisbane who supposedly did no mesh repair with success according to an email sent to me by the medical practice, but when I went for the consult he had NOT done it at all, not in many years and was actually pro mesh - a total waste of my time and the expensive fee of $250 for the visit.Why are there no mesh surgeons here, especially considering the dangers of mesh some of which have been banned overseas due to their low quality.Women in Australia (and elsewhere) won a legal case in November 2019 for mesh complications used in pelvic floor repair - and thousands of cases are pending in the US for hernia mesh repairs.I think the mesh makes more money for doctors - 2-3 hour surgery, vs 45 min surgery for no mesh repair. Also doctors used to do no mesh repairs before mesh came along but have lost that expertise now.Its about time doctors were re-trained and performed no mesh surgery to lessen the horrific complications of mesh surgery which cannot be removed if something goes wrong.I welcome the views of others please."

His figures seem good. He has this immense benefit of no chance of mesh complications and the possibly equal benefit of not requiring extensive technical training on the part of the surgeon.But I couldn't find a surgeon in Australia who would do it.And the whole medical establishment in Australia, within and without the government - i.e. up to and including the Royal College of Surgeons and the Minister for Health - would do nothing, not the smallest thing, to even acquaint themselves with Desarda's technique, much less make it available to me.Giving me a further reason to rely heavily on watchful waiting and hope for maybe a self healing.Well no self healing has happened and I've never heard of any regimen that might promote it.I now wonder what's happening with the world of patients and ex patients.Anyone had the Desarda technique? Knowledge of it spreading? Is it becoming available? Or has it gone backwards for some reason, found to be flawed? Or laparoscopy improved?Does anyone have any comment, any new information for me on this subject, please?"

It was a long and very painful recovery, I was in the hospital for exactly 2 months.I developed 2 incisional hernias several months later. The hernias were very painful and I know my weight at the time made matters worse. My wonderful surgeon told me I needed to lose 80 pounds before he would do the hernia surgery, because if I didn't lose the weight then the chance for more hernias after surgery was very good. So, I had weight loss surgery (laproscopic) in Nov 2016. I have lost 100 pounds.I have been feeling a lot better and getting exercise, etc, until Monday this week when I started having severe pain in the large hernia again. Now it even sticks out when I am in the laying down posistion. Because of the sudden pain, I saw my surgeon yesterday. He said I am ready for surgery. I am no longer considered high risk because of the weight loss. However, as he finished explaining what the surgery would entail, I was not prepared for his news. I am going to need open surgery (not lapro) and it will involve cutting me just below the breastbone all the way to the lower abdomen. He will remove scar tissue and adhesions from my prior abdominal surgeries, he will repair the hernias, muscular work will be done... basically a reconstruction of the abdominal wall. I didn't realize it was such a major surgery. Also, because of my prior abdominal surgeries, I will be in the hospital at least 3 days.He said I need to get this done soon because if I am up and active, the pain will just contine (I am taking Tramadol for pain). Currently I just lay in bed with the heating pad on. Severe pain. So I need to suck it up and just make that call and get the ball rolling on surgery.Sorry this is so long, but I need to talk to people who have been there.I am really scared of going through pain. For those of you that have had previous open abdominal surgeries, how bad is the pain after another open surgery? How long were you in the hospital and when you got back home, how did you do things on your own such as getting out of bed, walking around, etc.? Please share with me and thank you in advance. "

And I have never had nausea like this or the burping. I went to see my primary care doc.

By the time I saw him I was taking peptol bismol tagament, my own over the counter of what he prescibed.I have had multiple blood tests done, an ultra sound, a fecal exam looking for H Pylori, have seen a GI specialist, and now had a endoscopy. The result is that I do not have an ulcer, do have GERD, but not really as bad as it could be, and he saw a small HH. But, he didn't think that the HH could cause this much discomfort, he said it was too small. He stretched my esophagus but noted that there had been no narrowing of the esophagus? They were suppose to do a biopsy of my stomach lining, looking for H Pylori, but he didn't do it, I guess because he didn't find an ulcer.

"hernia","My Acid Reflux Produced Phlegm-Filled Cough","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-acid-reflux-produced-phlegm-filled-cough-705338","I have severe Acid Reflux , a Hiatal Hernia and Barrett's Esophagus and, in the last year, it has caused a chronic cough with excessive phlegm production, to the point where I feel like it's choking me. Not to be gross, but I tend to swallow it as I usually find it impossible to bring from the back of my throat to the front of my mouth to enable me to expel it. It bothers my boyfriend, especially when he is watching TV or trying to sleep.Since lying in bed, even with my wedge pillow, results in me waking up an hour or two later, coughing my guts out for the next few minutes, I frequently sleep on the couch, which is not really designed as a comfortable surface for regular sleeping, so I wake up frequently. All in all, this is causing me to grow increasingly irritable.I am carrying over 80 lbs. of excess weight, which is not good for the acid reflux and now have developed arthritis, especially in my knees. I am a 63-year old woman with a severe addiction to sweets that is almost impossible to control for more than a few months.It has reached the point where I am strongly considering a gastric bypass, as it would help me to lose weight and, I'm told, cure my acid reflux. In many ways, this terrifies me, but I have to do something. It would probably cure my sugar addiction, as consuming any more than a bite or two would cause me extreme discomfort.Any helpful advice would be very much appreciated.Thank you,WittyKat914"

So I was working out really hard one day , the next day I woke up in the middle of the night throwing up, there was also a sickness going around so it might have just been from that. The day after I was sick I was standing up and I realized I had a small painless bulge in my groin area. I started doing research and the only thing I could think of it being was a hernia because I lift a lot. So for the next few days I was stressing out a lot because I'm also in the process of joining the air force, and I can't have a hernia or else I could get disqualified.So I decided to go to the doctor, he didn't know quite what it was but he said it could possibly be a hernia or a swollen lymph node, he said it felt more hernia like though. So he sent me to get an ultra sound done, but ordered an abdominal ultra sound instead of a groin ultra sound apparently, so the girl that did it decided to check my groin area as well as the abdominal area, but she spent more time on the abdominal area even though that wasn't where the bulge was. So I was waiting for about an hour for the results ad eventually the doctor called and said everything was fine and there was no hernia. The bulge also for some reason went away for about 4 days or so, I figured I was all good and wouldn't have to worry about it anymore so I just went on with life. Then it came back a few days later.So now I'm here trying to figure out why I have a bulge in my groin, It's just really stressing me out because I have to go to boot camp in July. The bulge also disappears when I lay down. Someone help 😕"

This feeling of the mass went on for a few weeks or so, I went to see the Dr who sent me for an ultrasound on the whole of my abdomen. They couldn't find anything wrong but I was still having problems and worries about this lump which was hard, fairly large and I could move it around as if I could pop it back into myself? Also if I lay in a particular position and breath in and out I could feel it moving around? It doesn't protrude out of my skin however so isn't visible. I was sent back to have another ultrasound a few months later who again couldn't find anything. After this I just forgot about it and went about as normal, I didn't have many other problems. The lump was painless so was pretty easy to ignore. Fast forward to now, I'm nearly 21 and have still been having problems with this lump! I went to another Dr at my university a few months ago who claimed he couldn't feel anything and that was that. However the past few days I've had a lot of pain around the area and the mass is very prominent to feel, it seems like it's gotten larger? The pain is like a stabbing, burning sensation. I've been stupid and done some googling which has just freaked me out and I'm desperate for some advice. The reason I'm thinking it could be a hernia is because it seems to flair up and doesn't cause me constant problems, it disappears when I lie down and also if it was anything a lot worse I feel it would've been causing me many more problems over the 2 years, which it hasn't until now! I can't see a Doctor until I'm back at uni in January so have an agonising wait until then!If you've got this far then thank-you for reading, any advice or comfort would be greatly appreciated.

In 1985 when I injured myself I was in the Royal Air Force up until this point I considered myself to be quite fit, the first symptom I started experiencing was palpitations especially after over exerting myself from exercise. I went to see the RAF doctor at the time and after experiencing extremely bad chest pain was referred to a military medical specialist this was in 1986 in between I kept on getting the palpitations which was starting to worry me. After my appointment with the specialist he said that I was suffering from a chest virus which was more common in older people. He said it would clear up by itself and advised me to carry on training. So I carried on with my running cycling and I carried on with weight training but used lighter weights as well as sit ups skipping and football. The palpitations carried on I stared to experience other things I had pain in my neck shoulder ache headaches and chest pains. I left the RAF in 1897 but this symptoms carried on I got a job as a furniture lorry driver which meant lifting and carrying a lot, looking back on it I sometimes wonder how I managed and I cycled back and to work for many years but always had an uncomfortable feeling in my stomach especially under the ribcage I was also suffering from acid indigestion and regurgitation. I was now seeing a German Doctor as the chest pains were more frequent he carried out many tests and sent me to a heart specialist I had a barium test but nothing showed up. Then in 1993 we moved to a new area and the problems I was having were not getting any better I was getting more and more neck pain shoulder pain and pain between my shoulder blades. But my stomach was always very acidy so my house doctor sent me to an internist who gave me my first examination with an endoscope and found that I had a small hiatus hernia this was in 1994. This was the first time that I was put on omeprazol 40mg and have been taking this medication since then. The past couple of years my back pain has got a lot worse underneath my shoulder blades my neck my left shoulder sometimes my arm goes numb and now my left breast aches like hell and I now have a lot of pain in my left arm pit. I am in continuous pain right between my shoulder blades and now seem to have an itch that I can’t scratch also in the shoulder blade region. I have been on an internet form which I have recently come across which discusses the vagus nerve and hiatus hernia this forum seems to cover all the symtoms that I have been experiencing over the past 30 years. I have recently had a medical I am now 52 years old and still refuse to stop doing exercise even though I am now at the end of my tether. The doctor told me that I am still keep myself quite fit, but I am finding this quite hard to keep up. I can’t cycle anymore and running and jogging is out of the question, I walk quite often but it’s more of a march than a walk I do not enjoy it I suppose it’s just self disiplin that makes me do it but for how much longer I don’t know. This forum that I came across seems to have answered the question that I have been asking doctors for many years now. The vagus nerve could be the culprit and is it true that the hiatus hernia presses against this nerve and could therefore be causing most of my symptoms, like I said I am now finding this condition very hard to live with, I am looking for help on how to deal with this medical condition as the doctors I have visited won’t listen to me.Thank You for your timeRichard Jones"

"hernia","Hernia or Lymph Nodes","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hernia-or-lymph-nodes-660551","Hello all So a week ago, on Thursday, I was playing basketball as I often do 4-5 times a week. That evening, I began to feel some discomfort in the right inguinal area of the groin. I did not think much of it because I am often sore after playing.The next day, I played basketball again only to have the pain and discomfort noticeably increase. It felt like a dull ache in the whole bottom right of my groin area. I was massaging the painful area, almost absentmindedly, when I felt a lump a few inches below and an inch to the right of the belly button. The lump felt somewhat elongated, not circular. Perhaps 1cm at most in length/size. It was very tender, movable ... it felt as though it was ""swimming"" all over the place as I touched it. Furthermore, I felt a smaller lump below the first one. I found nothing identical on my left side.Over the next two days while at work, the pain did not lessen but was not terrible. The tenderness seemed to subside provided I wasn't poking at the area. So Monday, I played basketball again. And this time, the whole area seemed to inflame while I was on the court. For the first time, it was actually hindering my movement. When I got home, I put ice on the area and tried to relax. The next day, however, the entire area was extremely tender and sore. In addition, the upper part of the right leg (near the hip) was experiencing a dull numbness and ache. Crunching hurt. Leaning back hurt. Any kind of torso-twisting hurt.So I called my doctor's office and quite amazingly my doctor was available to see me that day. During the physical examination, he did locate the lump that was bothering me. I asked him if it was a lymph node and he seemed doubtful. He said that while there are lymph nodes in the area I was identifying, they are generally deep in the body and cannot be felt. His notion was that I was having the beginnings of a hernia and the rolling lump I was feeling was fatty tissue.He scheduled me for a full abdominal ultrasound and specified that they search for evidence of a hernia. So I had the ultrasound and person doing the ultrasound spent a large amount of time on the lower right groin area where the pain/lump was. Then I got the reports on Friday. A nurse from my doctor's office called me and told me that the ultrasound was completely normal except for a cyst on my left kidney . She also said there was ZERO evidence of a hernia.So I asked her ... ""did the radiologist or my doctor have any sense of what the lump was?"" And she replied that they had wrote nothing about that. I asked her if it could be a swollen lymph node and she said she did not know and that the radiologist and my doctor had written nothing about it so she assumed it was nothing.So I guess I have a few questions. Firstly, can an ultrasound give a false negative with regards to a hernia? I remain in pain which seems to worsen with physical movement/lifting/jumping etc. Do I merely have an abdominal strain?Secondly, am I just being overly anxious with the notion that the ultrasound/radiologist/doctor missed a swollen lymph node?? Is there any conceivable way that such a thing could happen? If the ultrasound showed a worrisome lymph node, wouldn't they tell me? They saw the kidney cyst, after all lol.Has anyone had an experience like this? Any advice and sharing is truly appreciated."

A couple of months after the surgery I developed an incisional hernia which is now huge and causing problems with movement and mobility. Initially the surgeon said he would operate to repair the hernia but during a second meeting he seems very reluctant stating that the initial surgery was complex and risky. He thinks that the risk of more surgery is too high. He said the risk of death is around 15%. I’m baffled and don’t know what to do. I can’t live forever with this hernia, it’s a real risk of strangulation. Has anyone here been faced with a similar situation?"

"hernia","Out of Options - Just want a Listening Ear","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/out-of-options-just-want-a-listening-ear-664223","Hello.I'm just extremely tired of my chronic illness with seemingly no escape from the horrible reality that is my life at this point. Heck, it just feels like waiting for death at this point. But before I get too much into detail, I have to say that this will be rather long and I really just want to tell my story to anyone who might be able to relate.I'm 20 years old male. No particular family history aside from late life hypertension and diabetes. No one had anything particularly wrong with them in my family, except me. I was a healthy young lad until I got out of high school, when I had chest pain and was thusly diagnosed with GERD. I took antibiotics and PPIs and my health went downhill since then.It's been 3 years since that original diagnosis. My health slowly went down the gutter as time went on. Daily BelchingFast heart rate that seems to drop instead of rise when standing up for exampleShortness of Breath(generally getting more and more constant)BloatingAbdominal PainChest pain and pressureWeight LossColdnessPoor Blood CirculationExcessive GasI used to be fairly active until this slew of hellish symptoms came my way. I've done every test imaginable. EKG, Echo, Holter, blood tests... Nothing comes up(aside from something borderline at worst). My GP refuses to do any specialized testing(for leaky gut or perhaps autoimmune illnesses) and even the cardiologist just shrugged me off suggesting that I'm ""too young"" to have any major cardiac issue without anything congenital. Yet I feel random shortness of breath during sporadic parts of the day. The chest pain can be worse at times and less at other times. Movement makes my chest pain worse with shortness of breath(heart failure anyone?). Literally no one is of any help. I want to turn to secondary medication at this point. Chinese medication maybe? The PPIs don't help. Makes me feel bloated and worse in general, but I have no idea at this point. I just take them without thinking anymore. I go to the ER with severe chest pain and shortness of breath, but get sent back home saying that the EKG would pick up heart attacks and what not. I got an interesting report in my latest bloodtest suggesting that I have some sort of thyroid issue(though it's impossible to know due to strange readings), but I can say for sure that it's not my core problem. I get sporadic palpitations and chest pain that radiates to my neck and left arm from my sternum which I guess might be a hiatal hernia. I have some severe esophagitis despite no acid coming up to disturb it. Food just doesn't stay down. It's always up to my throat. At this point I feel like I'm just waiting until I keel over and die for my GP or ER to even blink. I don't go out. I don't do anything anymore. I try to walk around a bit, but I feel like I'm already on my death bed at only 20. Is this my life now? Am I supposed to just accept defeat and crawl into a hole? There's apparently no cause except ""anxiety"". My blood circulation is awful at this point making me tire out easily and get chest pain and shortness of breath with any exertion. It ""isn't serious"". But I literally have no life anymore. I'm just suffering daily and the things I hear online rarely help either. Can anyone just relate to how awful life can become with these mystery issues? It's gotten worse and worse and I feel like those ""healthy"" teenagers who die ""healthy"" are defined by these standards. My heart acts strangely, sometimes opting to race and sometimes being slow and causing chest pain. There are times I legitimately thought I was done for, but I guess it wasn't time just yet. ""Stomach Problems don't cause any cardiac issues or shortness of breath""Well, I guess I'll just die then. My dear parents suffer so much because of me too. I can see the fear in their eyes every time I have the pain and shortness of breath. I'm just so miserable. All my fellow age young adults going to college and setting up their futures. How I envy them so...If you made it this far, thank you so much for reading. Just sharing this gets a lot off my chest and just a little bit of sympathy comes a long way. Please don't be that one person who suggests heart failure, thyroid storms, heart attacks, pointe de torsades, COPD or whatnot anymore. I'm tired of pondering the possibilities. The tests say otherwise, so I just need to learn to cope(until I can't and succumb). "

I have noticed that many of you are Australian. I’ve been trying to find online support for my sliding hiatal hernia condition. I have a completely nonexistent LES (caused by heavy lifting at my job) and am thoroughly and overwhelmingly tortured by reflux, nausea, bloating, vomiting, chest pain, back pain, shoulder pain, neck pain, vertigo, and headaches but mostly chest pain (under my ribs) back pain and unrelenting reflux even though I take 40 Omeprazole and Ranitidine, plus sucralfate every day. It has made my life a living Hell. I went from being a vibrant, healthy and extremely active 48 year old woman to a broken down old woman of 52 who can’t keep a commitment, who has lost her jobh of 13 years, and who rarely leaves the house. I hardly eat anythingn eggs, cottage cheese, rice cakes! Fruit, vegies, and only a fistful at a time. My eating needs alone keep me housebound quite frequently. My GI doc is taking his sweet time getting me hooked up with a surgeon for fundoplication and I feel like my stomach is moving farther up into my chest cavity every day. It hurts so much it makes me cry and sends me to the ED at least once a month(where they won’t give me anything for pain). I know the pain is caused by the stretching of the diaphragm and the stomach moving into my chest cavity and pressing on my vagus nerve. My question is have any of your doctors addressed your very legitimate pain with anything other than PPIs? I feel like if it just didn’t hurt so much I could actually be productive on some level. But here in the US there is now a war on opioid based pharmaceuticals and if you even ask for them you are labeled a ‘med seeking’ drug addict. Have any of you had nerve blockers of any kind for the pain from the Vagus nerve compression?This pain is making me feel extremely depressed and my PCP has put me on an antidepressant, which helped for a while and still helps a little but there are days that I just wish I was dead; that I want to be dead. It is such a hopeless feeling knowing that there is a potential scenario in which I could feel like this for the rest of my life with no help from the medical profession. I have become someone I no longer recognize physically, mentally, or emotionally. That is no life at all.i sure could use a friendly word of support and some clue as to how to deal with the pain.thanks all for reading... My best to all of you who suffer as I do.Martha"

It wasn't painful and I couldn't afford to take off work again to get it fixed so I just watched it. 3 years later it's just now starting to really feel weird, so I suppose i'm going to have to get it fixed. I didn't realize that if I let it get to big that I'd have to have open surgery to fix it. I haven't gone to the Dr. yet, but i'm supposing thats whats going to happen. So many questions, I feel helpless and hapless. According to the net It seems like repeated hernias are common. One person from that thread had 20 and the Dr that did my procedure admitted he had 3. Has there been any further research in the changes that have taken place in the tissues that cause them to be weaker in that area. I'd gladly join a medical study that is focused on how this part of our body is failing over the generations.Is it something in the american diet?If someone was on a diet that everything remained soft through the intestine would this help?Do vegetarians have less hernias?Another reason I waited was that I thought that my job duties helped cause it by poor lifting. So I was going to wait till I was in a different career. Is there any truth to the statement ""the old belief, that they are caused by bad lifting, straining, are largely discounted nowadays""So many people are affected by this. If the medical profession is content the ""surgical merry-go-round"" constantly spitting out money like a broken jackpot slot machine, will it ever be looked into?How do we join together to start a study to protect our children from suffering the same fate?

"hernia","Hiatus Hernia Repair - Yay or Nay?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hiatus-hernia-repair-yay-or-nay--324857","Hi guys! Just looking a little advice regarding Hiatus Hernias, a weak sphincter valve and fundoplication surgery versus other methods of treatment. First a little about myself. I am 22 years old, living in UK (Northern Ireland) and have just been diagnosed with a small hiatus hernia and an un-functioning sphincter valve. I have been suffering with pains for almost 4 years now, since age 18. GERD.. Reflux, stomach pains, chest pains, sore throat, coughing, the weirdest belching sound which is almost constant and sounds like a dragon around my breast bone (I physically can not burp) vomiting, periods of constipation/diarrhea, back pain.. The list really is endless, and these symptoms are mostly intermittent but sometimes very severe and debilitating. It massively affected my life, especially throughout university and I don't know how much more I can take. I have had to pass up on massive career opportunities and miss a lot of work because of my health. I was hoping to travel to Australia in the early half of 2015 but I don't think it is realistic with my current health problems.In the last 4 years the NHS have literally part diagnosed/suggested I have all number of diseases, or sometimes told me there is nothing wrong at all.. I have been treated/diagnosed/referred for bronchitis, Celiac disease, MA, arthritis, and a whole host of other random things.. But have never heard the word hernia mentioned.. To be honest up until a month ago I though a hernia was something boys got on their bits!I have tried every type of antacid available. Tablet form, steroids, some rotten pink liquid, gluten/lactose free diet, laxatives, pain relief.. To be honest nothing has ever really worked notably and as I am quite bad at taking tablets I would occasionally forget to take them and not feel any better/worse off for it.I have been to see endless GPs, had a 6 night stay in hospital, been to out of hours, A+E and never really got any answers apart from a prescription for yet more drugs and on the odd occasion a referral.Finally made the decision to go private about a month ago after an NHS gastro doc suggested an Endoscopy. I couldn't wait months for answers so after finding out my Dad's company have private health insurance with H3 for our whole family I booked into Kingsbridge private hospital in Belfast. In the last month I have had my private consultation, a barium meal which revealed a small hiatus hernia and a weakening in the stomach valve (apparently mine does not close at all!) this was re-confirmed with an endescopy and I had a colonoscopy to confirm there was no bowel problems. I had my evaluation appointment today with the private consultant who has recommended a dietician, some form of antacid, a laxative to relieve pressure around my bowels to hopefully relieve some abdominal pain and a review appointment in 3 months.. I broke into tears when he said this.. Although I have had a definite diagnosis which I am massively relieved about, it is exactly the same thing I have had tons of NHS docs tell me.. Meds meds and more meds! He polished it up with a dietician and said the only other option is surgery but he wouldn't advice because I am too young and there are a lot of complications. I came on tonight to research the surgery and although the side effects some of you guys are facing seem awful I doubt it is worse than how I feel now. Honestly I feel like I have nothing to loose! I have booked a review appointment for 3 months with the same consultant but now I am seriously considering ringing tomorrow to book another appointment and beg for this surgery.. I feel like I am 22 and my young adult life hasn't even started yet.In an ideal world I would get the surgery in around January, have a few months recovery and be on a plane to Australia sipping strawberry daiquiris by April. I understand recovery can take much longer than this but I am at a wits end.I just wanted to appeal to any one else in a similar situation to see their thoughts.. Do you recommend surgery, have you had it done, How did the procedure/recovery go? Or can you recommend any other forms of treatment? I am particularly interested in finding someone who has the complication with the valve also as I have only been able to find one comment relating which said it involves another part to the procedure to replace/repair the valve while they are fixing the hernia? ThanksRobyn "
"hernia","Breathing problems, posture and hernia are all related ?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/breathing-problems-posture-and-hernia-are-all-related--339341","Hi guys just want to add so many points here. I stumbled on this forum so please excuse my initial excitement as I feel as if I may finally get my resolve. I have had all of the above symptoms plus more which all points towards classic HH. Yet to be diagnosed as the doctors haven’t quiet confirmed this. They themselves seem quiet confused but I will go and see the quacks again next week and this time force my opinion on them that this is definitely Classic HH. Can I just say, I am so ashamed that I should have picked up on this earlier or at least researched my symptoms on a forum like this. My wife as continuously badgered me to get this breathing problem sorted and my reply has always been an emphatic, “the doctors will never understand me so why should I go”. So many years have now passed and I have suffered at the hands of this horrid disease which has limited me as a human being, limited my conversation with loved ones. I am so short tempered as I cannot hold a conversation particularly after a meal. I fear meal times knowing that this dreaded breathing problem will come back and then haunt me for the next 2 or 3 hours. I squirm my way through the day wondering why this disease lives with me. My thoughts are separated into two, 24 hours a day. Part of me functions on a day to day basis through work and the challenges thrown at me and the other if mesmerized by this breathing issue….what the hell is it. I have totally lost my confidence as a person. I used to exude so much confidence and now I’m like a tortoise, I just want to eat my meal and then curl up in my shell..Ok, so now the practicalities….Can I just ask does anyone suffer from excessive bloatedness after eating a meal and further a deteriorating posture when sitting or standing. And before anyone asks, I hardly eat a great deal so I'm definitely not over eating ok! Perhaps if I elaborate, when and after I have eaten a small or medium meal, I feel that my stomach protrudes and I looks visibly bloated, I then have poor breathing and hyperventilation which then leads to poor posture as I am contracting (bending forward) in order to relieve my diaphragm and/or sternum from further stress. I now hunch a lot especially when I am at my desk as this is possibly my best and favored position after a meal. I am conscious of my posture which further irritates me. I then try to desperately correct my posture which then leads to anxiety and further hyperventilation as I am applying an upward pressure on my sternum.As a long term sufferer of HH, my poor breathing as also affected my eye sight. Sounds weird but poor breathing means that vital organs are not receiving vital supplies of oxygen which then leads to a breakdown in that organ. Further, because I have starved my organs of this valuable oxygen I reckon I am now suffering from memory lapses and poor concentration. I have noticed that I forget a lot of details and also im not as creative as I used to me. My conversation is limited and I stutter at times as I’m trying to breathe my words out correctly. I’m conscious of my breathing all the time whether I should be breathing from the abdomen or chest or both.I will leave it at that for now, but please please do comment on my over enthused response above and tell me if you suffer those additional symptoms I have listed.

Endoscopy showed a small hiatal hernia ( wasn’t told the size), barium swallow also showed a small HH and neither showed any narrowing or constriction in the esophagus. PPIs not giving any relief. I’ve been off all gluten and sugar for nearly 4 months. I eat no sugar, no carbonated beverages, no fruit juices, I do drink 1 cup of coffee in the morning. I get no relief from anything. My entire summer break ( I’m a teacher) has been suffering and in complete discomfort. Felt I was completely dismissed by the dr yesterday when discussed repairing the HH. I am not one who wants to be on meds for the rest of my life. He told me I shouldn’t be having this much pain with one no bigger than mine. Well, isn’t that a subjective statement to make? Isn’t that telling someone who has a small break in the bone that their pain isn’t as bad as the person next to them because the other persons break is bigger? Pain is pain! If I have a sliding HH I’ve read and been told they’re harder to diagnose due to the fact they “slide” and could not be in the sliding position at the time of the scope/swallow. I’m just so frustrated and discouraged. I’m needing and wanting help! I need someone to listen to me and understand that what I am feeling is real and not in my head as I was made to feel yesterday. Someone who wants to give me my quality of life back. I am a marathon runner. Have completed multiple full marathons in over 20 states. So I’m not one who just sits around being inactive.

"hernia","Hiatal Hernia Symptoms","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hiatal-hernia-symptoms-663268","Hey all So a few months ago, I had an endoscopy that showed a 2cm hiatal hernia. Since then I have been experiencing symptoms that I believe are possibly due to the hernia. My GI told me that at 2cm, the hernia should not cause me much pain/discomfort. I am starting to become doubtful of that assertion, however.Here is what I have been experiencing:1.) A dull ache at the base of the sternum, right around the xiphoid process cartilage. This comes and goes and I have not been able to link it to any physical activity or particular foods. When I am experiencing this pain, the bottom ribs to either side of the base of the sternum are also tender and sore.2.) At the base of the sternum, right around the xiphoid process, I will also sometimes feel a ""pressure."" When I gently press the area, I will feel a slight shift and ""hear"" a small popping sound. No one else can hear it, however. It is almost as if I can hear it internally only.3.) Even though the endoscopy showed very minor, reflux-related inflammation that has healed as far as my GI is concerned, there are times when my esophagus feels ""kinked"" or ""stiff."" For example, if I lay down on my back (even on an inclined, reflux-friendly bed) I will get a thudding/popping feeling at the top of my esophagus (bottom of throat) whenever I swallow. If I lay on my right side, the same feeling and thudding occurs. However, if I lay on my left side? NOTHING. Is this because the hernia is pushing on my esophagus except for when my stomach is positioned below my esophagus while laying on my left side?4.) When I sit on my weightlifting bench at a 70% angle and do bicep curls, I can feel a slight shift at the base of my sternum as well. Is this also the hernia? My GI did suggest I stay away from cruches and sit-ups or lifting heavyyyy weights.I am basically looking for some advice from people who have had experience with a hiatal hernia. Do these symptoms sound familiar? Am I dealing with a sliding hernia?Thank you so much in advance for your time and advice!"

I have had all the tests to see about surgery which they refused to do! I have had gaviscon, nexium, lansprozale, omeprozal and ranitidine. the most effective being the gaviscon (i was taking it by the bucket load) but it reacts with garlic resulting in a lot of wind most of the others did nothing and here is what the doctors don't tell you. All the tablets I mentioned apart from gaviscon are pp inhibitors they stop the stomach producing acid, so how do you then digest your food? they reduce digestive enzymes that then result in constipation which then makes the reflux worse. when the food isn't digested properly your gut can't absorb the nutrients from it (as a result my iron levels are very low, but can't take iron supplements as they cause consipation). Vicious circle. but it gets worse the food lying your gut then can start to ferment instead of digest and this causes more wind (like you need any more) and this puts more pressure on the hernia causing more reflux despite taking meds, this can then go up your gullet causing breathing difficulties because the acid is getting into your lungs and causing sore throat, sinusitis, ear pain and lots of catarrah, the catarrah then goes down to your stomach causing more digestive problems as your stomach isn't supposed digest that.Women who think it gets worse around that time of the month are right, the hormone change that happens every month, slow your bowel down, cause some degree of anxiety and stress which increase stomach acid causing more of the same problems. Hormones control every function in your body, stress and poor nutrition can change the way they operate. I have researched extensively, using a guinea pig for my theories (ME!) and found that trying cut out all processed food (especially sugars), reducing bread and carbs down to a minimum and eating easily digestible foods ie fruit and veg really helps, as well as eating a natural yoghurt everyday (unless your lactose intolerant) really helps but it doesn't get rid of it completely.I have had nearly every symptom that I have seen listed on this forum. I would advise anybody who has this condition to keep a food & symptoms diary to try and help yourself as much as possible. It very possible that symptoms of IBS will make the reflux worse, this has been my worst year yet back in feb I couldn't eat anything cos I kept feeling like I was choking it took a few weeks to get back to normal food but something still isn't right I have lost over 2.5 stone, I have no energy and I find the doctors worse than useless.

Immediately after surgery, it took almost 3 hours for them to find something to take the edge off for my husband to even be allowed to visit me.

I'm in the UK.I was diagnosed with a right inguinal hernia last December - no bulge visible, but the little thing can be felt slightly poking out from the superficial inguinal ring when performing the Valsava manoeuvre. Painwise it's not bad at all, sometimes does give me mild discomfort, and sometimes mild testicular pain, but really nothing that would require urgent care.Initally GP found no hernia, carried out a few tests to explain intermittent testicular pain, then a private visit to a hernia surgeon confirmed the hernia. Went back to GP for a referral, but since private surgeon was outside of my local health board, had to wait months to see my local hospital NHS surgeon, who confirmed the presence of an hernia, very small.Surgeon ordered an US scan (going for it today!) to size the defect, but mentioned that although it's true hernias do get bigger with time and makes sense carrying out a repair, the risk of inserting a mesh that could cause more problems is real and needs to be taken into account.Interestingly the surgeon I saw privately said ""yes we have to repair it"" and never mentioned how, but based on my own research on him I'm positive he'd use mesh.My NHS surgeon would probably do a tension-free open mesh repair, and the nice thing is that she spent quite some time explaining to me all the risks associated with the mesh and the fact that I might well be going from the mild discomfort I have now to constant chronic pain.Hence I have been starting researching options on pure tissue repairs, and found there are only a few surgeons that offer this.So far I've been able to find Peter Jones and Sue Jones based in Maidstone, Kent, and Ulrike Muschaweck, Munich based but she also comes to the UK. Also I have read about Andreas Koch (somewhere near Berlin).The Jones have now retired, so I'm left with Muschaweck and Koch.I was wondering whether anybody has got any experience with them, or if there are other options for a pure tissue repair in the UK.Many thanks in advance,David "

"hernia","Pain from hiatus hernia or something else? Any ideas anyone? ","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/pain-from-hiatus-hernia-or-something-else-any-ideas-anyone--655629","I have had symptoms ever since I had whooping cough 9 years ago, so when I had an endoscopy a few years back and told I have a small Hiatus Hernia, I am guessing the coughing caused it. I have a history of IBS and gastritis but endoscopy found no new gastritis and IBS symptoms mostly improved if I keep to a simple diet free from gluten, sugar, processed foods etc. I also have a gallstone apparently but I think I know when I get that kind of pain if I eat too much fat.Anyway, in some ways it doesn't sound like classic HH, and the Gastro labelled me as Non Ulcer Dyspepsia, but I notice that most of the foods we should avoid with HH can trigger it, notably acidic fruit and chocolate. I get a constant pain in the middle of my abdomen below my rib cage right in the solar plexus. Just nagging and continual if I have a flare, and it can go on for days and days once triggered, and my stomach swells up. Omeprazole will usually relieve the pain but I don't want to be on it for long, as it mucks up my digestion badly in other ways lower gut, as it's suppressing my acid. Also Slippery Elm helps a bit too. So the pain is the worst thing and I don't have nausea or a lot of reflux (some at night when I lay down but nothing major).I prefer to use alternative therapies rather than Omeprazole, but I really am running out of ideas as I have tried so much and it seems to be getting worse recently (maybe due to a slight weight increase perhaps and a loss of height).I see there are no magic wands to be had online so far. I do subscribe to the theory that if you increase the acid then that can help to tighten the Lower Oesophagul Sphincter, so that should help it. I do have periods when it's not too bad, and I have been using HCL with Betaine, so think that is helping, but then I go and eat something with chocolate or maybe with slightly too much fat and it all unravels again.

I had my right ingunial hernia surgery four days ago. Because of my prostate removal I was not eligible for a laparoscopic procedure. While all the caregivers were great and I came home with a couple of pages of does and don'ts, there are several things I wish I would have known in advance.1. You really will need someone with you constantly for the first 48 hours. I was up every four hours to pee and take meds and I could not get up or back down without assistance.2. You will need a recliner or an adjustable bed the first 3 days. I tried from the beginning to get into bed and could do it only at the end of the third day.3. Be aware that it is common due to the anesthetics and the nature of the surgery to have trapped gas. The first 24 hours once I got home was pure agony. My whole gut and right side was one big pain. My initial thought was that I broke or dislocated my hip. After doing some research I determined it was gas. Once released with a suppository the pain subsided.4. You may all of a sudden find that your penis and testicals have been absorbed into your scrotum and it is all swollen and red. As my wife was preparing to take me to the emergency room, I was able to contact my surgeon and explain to him what I was experiencing. He told me this was normal and not to worry.5. If you can get a walker with a seat and brakes it will be invaluable especially the first 3 days. Nice to have a safety net.6. Don't try to be brave and go without pain meds. I thought I could tough it out and I was so very wrong. My suggestion would be to take the max the first two days and then gradually decrease. I tried going without starting the 4th day and after skipping one dose took a half dose the next time.Would be interested to see if others had similar experiences."

Fast forward to may last year, i had a period of time whereby i was insanely stressed with work and a few other things. My meal times were all over the place due to work (usually 8.30 - 10pm) after having eaten very little all day. I started to suffer from a burning in my chest, and heartburn, but also a fluttering feeling under my left lung, then what almost felt like a heavy dull burning pain, i guess at times ive likened it to a hot poker. That carried on for a few months, then alongside that i started occassionally feeling like i was struggling to swallow my food, and was sometimes feeling full after eating very little.This has carried on now but other thungs have developed, really bad back ache, fron the centre (trapezius area) up into my shoulders but predominantly left side. I am getting tight chested and sometimes a little wheezy at night. The chest pain has become almost constant alongside the back pain, the chest burning poker feeling is there almost constantly. There are some other small ailments, aches pains etc but i've basically listed the most prominent issues.I finally got the courage to see my gp yesterday, he didnt seem overly concerned but has asked for 2 stool samples (testing for h pylori) and something else i believe he said IBD. He didnt physically examine me or do anything other than prescribe me 2 x 150mg ratiridine daily (i said i didnt want to be taking PPI's for any length of time) Basically can anyone put my mind at rest that it is sounding like a Hh, also have i made a bad choice by not having something like omezaprol?

Barium meal took like 25 minutes, it confirmed I didn't. I was shocked. My new gastroenterologist was correct. He thought my reflux was allergy related and that in endoscopies, due to retching, the stomach CAN in occasion push upwards to create the appearance of a hiatus hernia. I had another endoscopy 2 days ago. Lo and behold, despite retching during the procedure, I don't have a hiatus hernia! My first endoscopist who misdiagnosed me couldn't even recall what type of hiatus hernia I had (sliding or para-oesophagul), he just stated in his report that I had a mid sized HH.

"hernia","Inguinal hernia - advice needed - what to do","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/inguinal-hernia-advice-needed-what-to-do-557599","HelloI’m quite new on the forum here, and would really appreciate some advice. I learned recently that I have a small inguinal hernia (about 2.5 cm). I’ve done a little reading here and elsewhere about hernia surgery, and must admit, that while I’d like to get this fixed, I’m quite scared of what I read concerning the possibility that chronic pain could result from the surgery. So my question to everyone here whose knowledge and judgment certainly goes well beyond mine … what would you do if you were me?Here’s my situation: I’m 67 years old and in good physical shape, having been a distance runner for the past two decades. I’m not on any medications whatsoever. My family doctor has described my hernia as “small”. He feels I really don’t need to do anything about it at this time. A second doctor – a surgeon with lots of experience with hernias – has also stated than an option is definitely watchful waiting. He stated that the risk of anything serious developing was quite small (though not non-existent). He did though, that “these things don’t get better on their own” and most people eventually (with ten years or so) end up getting surgery. I did search around for a surgeon who was experienced with non-mesh repairs and this doctor certainly is. He does both types, but is an advocate for, and experienced with the Shouldice-type of repair. I do understand that the recurrence rate is a little higher when mesh is not used, and I would accept that because I just want to avoid mesh. But in terms of chronic pain issues after surgery he has indicated that as many as 30% of people getting the surgery, can possibly have chronic pain issues. (I read different statistics in different places, but if this number is anywhere near accurate, this really concerns me.)Currently, my hernia is only mildly symptomatic. I am aware of it, expecially at the end of the day when I have a few sensations (not exactly pain, but some different feelings there). It’s probably more of an issue mentally than physically for me, because it’s on my mind. Also maybe I’ve scared myself some by reading some of the online post-surgery stories.The other factor for me is that I currently have a shoulder tendonosis issue that causes fairly constant, though low-level discomfort for me. This is sometimes a challenge for me to deal with, and I certainly don’t want to add to this with any chronic pain that might result from hernia surgery. I should add that I’ve also read about exercises that could possibly resolve such hernias, or at least keep symptoms from becoming worse. I’ve already started some of these, and am prepared to commit fully to these if they have potential.Anyway, I know there aren’t any “right” answers, but I would really appreciate any thoughts concerning what you would do if you were in my place.I do have a surgery date schedule in about a month, but I’m really wondering now, whether I want to go through with it, or wait.Again, thanks in advance for any thoughts or advice!

He said he was not going to use mesh and does a meshless procedure.Well I woke up and was cut open on both side of my grown and since then I have had nothing but issues.I went back and he told me to get a shot to help the pain.I didn’t get the shot and figured it was part of healing.Well about 3 weeks ago I could not take it anymore and went back to the surgeon and he did an ultrasound again and said they were back and he would not charge me and needs to use mesh.I decided to go to another doctor to get a second opinion and he ordered a ct scan of my pelvis area.He told me he has never heard of a surgeon not to use mesh especially when they cut someone open.He also told me there was a tack inside me which makes sense from the pain I’m having. He also told me my hernias are fine.And told me to maybe get a colonoscopy to check for colon cancer??!!?? So I have the first surgeon telling me I need surgery to fix the hernia again with mesh.A second doctor that says my hernias look fine but tells me a tack is in me and to get a colonoscopy.So is the first doctor covering his ass to get this tack out? If my hernias are not back why would this doctor want to preform surgery on me again?And now the cancer issue is strange also.I have had nothing but pain in my surgical areas, I can’t move or walk right, my lower abdominal area always hurts now and I have a hard time breathing at times like something is pinching up my body.My stool have been brutal.

When I got to the hospital they gave me a shot for the pain and sent me off for a CT scan. The scan showed I had a stranguated hernia and I was immediately rushed into theatre (luckily there was a theatre available at the time) The hernia cut off the vlood supply to my small intestine and a large portion had to be cut away and a bowel resection done.

"hernia","Pain 3 Months Since Abdominal Open Hernia Surgery","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/pain-3-months-since-abdominal-open-hernia-surgery-610892","Hello,I had open abdominal hernia surgery on June 6. It was for a large incisional hernia that formed a year or so after my colon resection.I am still having pain. I do have a seroma in my abdomen that requires draining every week. Sometimes the fluid is between 1 to 2 liters each time. I know that I have some pain associated with that. The main pain that has really been bothering the past several days is a pain that is a little higher in my stomach area (not in the seroma area). The only way I know how to describe it: it feels like muscle pain... very painful and it hurts worse when I sit up, move around, walk, etc, although it also hurts when laying down--just not as bad as it does when moving around. This severe pain is almost as painful as it was at the very beginning (right after surgery). I do know that this area is the area where the original hernia was, and where the mesh repair was done.I am wondering about other people's experiences with pain a few months after abdominal hernia surgery. What did your pain feel like and what was the outcome? Did your doctor say it was normal to have the pain?I have had 2 open abdominal surgeries, the colon resection was very bad. I have also had 2 laproscopic abdominal surgeries. I have lots of scar tissue from that and the hernia surgery. My doctor did tell me that scar tissue will cause pain. He also said that I might have pain for the rest of my life because of the major surgeries and that I might need to stay on tramadol for treatment. I was really kind of shocked. The tramadol taken with tylenol does help the pain a little, but I can't imagine staying on it for years to come.Please share your thoughts/experiences. Thank you in advance.Shelley"

It's been a bit more than 6 months since I had inguinal hernia surgery. May 5,2017. Laparoscopic using mesh. Surgeon used absorb-able tacks. Healing went well, pain disappeared rather quickly. I did great for 6 weeks post surgery, no pain once the initial post op pain subsided. I felt normal and physician ok'd me to go back to my usual life. So I tried some golf, doctor knew from first visit pre-surgery I played so we discussed when I could play again. I had some discomfort after the second round, but the next day I awoke to severe stabbing pains with every step. I went back to my doctor and he felt golf had stressed the surgical tacks and the pain would stop in time as they dissolved. Over time the severe pain did cease and I am much improved, however pain still creeps in can increase by just walking about or standing after awhile. Sitting upright at a table for a few hours can cause some discomfort as well. It can present as stiffness or a kind of heated feeling from my pelvis bone down to near my upper inner thigh. Sometimes it's a dull stab at the former hernia site. I rest by reclining once it begins to reappear and the discomfort decreases in a reasonable amount. At home also I still get the random quick sporadic pinch, stiffness and stab just by moving about. Sleeping I am largely pain free. I was a fairly active person, including regular exercise, prior to surgery and now I'm not active at all. I now confine my activities to just basic functions at home and necessary errands. Just for FYI my age is 61, 6'3” and 200 pounds. Other than this issue I am in good health.I visited my surgeon again in August and he did have an ultrasound performed on me, with valsalva, and it showed nothing of concern to him. He isn't interested in having an MRI or CT scan performed. I look normal, no bulges or discoloration. Bodily functions are normal. My surgeon isn't offering me anything now except trying pain management shots.With the goal of getting my old life back I would prefer to better understand what is causing the issue and finding a solution if possible. I believe my options at this point is to rest more and see if things improve further over the next few months. Or is it too soon for option 2 which is to go ahead and find another surgeon and get a second opinion? Which I guess could end up including a revision of the first surgery work. So I would prefer suggestions to include for that possibility. From where I live major parts of Virginia and Maryland are within reasonable distance. So I would be open to any recommendations. Thoughts please."

"hernia","Diagnosed with indirect inguinal hernia, and previously, gastritis, lots of questions","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/diagnosed-with-indirect-inguinal-hernia-and-previously-gastritis-lots-of-questions-617558","So I was recently diagnosed with indirect inguinal hernia. First off, a little about me. I'm early 40's Asian, and I consider myself very fit, as I've been running marathons and usually log in 2000+ miles a year. I get regular health screenings (cholesterol / blood pressure / glucose) and those numbers usually come back perfectly normal. My problem began a few weeks ago after what I thought was a routine workout at the gym, and the next day it felt like I strained my groin. The pain didn't go away after a couple weeks, so I went to a clinic. I told the doctor that though I felt pain, I couldn't pinpoint exactly where it was, only that it was to the right of my groin. After doing some tests to make sure it was not muscular, the doctor felt around and had me cough, and after that he determined I had an indirect inguinal hernia, albeit a very small one, right around where I said my pain was located. I have no visible bumps, and personally, I'm not able to feel the location of the hernia, so I'm trusting that the doctor is competent and knows what he felt.He told me to go back to see him after a week (last week) to see if it gets better on its own, and it actually did, to the point where I felt totally fine. But this week, I've bounced around from ""I can feel it but it doesn't hurt"" to ""uncomfortable / sore"". Today has been worse than the other days, as I've actually had to stop mid-run because I felt like the hernia was getting worse.Here's where it gets complicated. Back in April, I had intense heartburn and stomach pains, and after a bunch of tests and eventually getting an endoscopy, it was determined I had mild gastritis (if what I had was ""mild"", I don't want to know what full blown gastritis feels like). Eventually, after weeks of taking Nexium, my symptoms mostly disappeared. (Incidentally, initially I took Prilosec, which didn't alleviate the pain at all). Since then, I would still get occasional days of my stomach not feeling quite right, but I never got the burning throat sensation again, until tonight. Just an hour ago (and hours after the aforementioned run), I had a wave of nausea and burning throat. I couldn't eat dinner as I felt I couldn't hold anything down. In other words, it felt exactly like my gastritis from April.So here's all my questions:1) Is there a possibility that the inguinal hernia and gastritis are related, or are compounding / conflating each other? I want to say it's too much of a coincidence that my gastritis is striking back just as my hernia symptoms are getting worse. But I acknowledge it really could be just a coincidence.2) My doctor was hoping that the hernia symptoms would go away on its own (and it actually did for a week), but he did acknowledge that surgery would be a possibility. Everything I read online is that hernias can't repair itself. Is this true? Once you have a hernia, unless you get surgery, will you always have that hernia?3) Regarding surgery, he seemed to suggest that because it's quite small, most likely a surgeon would suggest a laparoscopic surgery with simple stitching (ie no mesh). Does this sound right to you? After hours of reading online, I can't determine whether the mesh or no mesh approach is better (depending on which article you read, they're both superior to the other). What say you?4) I'm going to ask for a referral for a surgeon, but I want to know what questions should I be asking the surgeon? What are the signs that he will take good care of me, and what are the red flags?5) How likely is it the doctor misdiagnosed my indirect inguinal hernia, and that it's actually something else completely different? 6) My doctor also said that smaller hernias like mine are also more at risk for strangulation. From what I read online, it's quite serious, but what I'm unsure about is how great is this risk? And also, what are the definitive symptoms that I may have it? They say ""acute pain"", but not where. At the sight of the hernia? Elsewhere? Could (and this is me being paranoid), the symptoms I'm feeling now that I think are gastritis-related be actually nothing to do with gastritis but everything to do with the hernia?7) Can indirect inguinal hernia pain radiate outward, to, say, inner thigh? I'm feeling a bit of soreness there right now, and I don't know if it's to do with my hernia or simply due to running (ie, typical soreness).I may also just be feeling general weakness due to gastritis, but I really don't know.Thanks in advance for any answers!"

I'm not one for doc visits, and I like to get a feel for what I might have before spending a grand on doc tests just to find out it was nothing.Experiences:?-Discomfort/Tightness in Lower-Mid Left Rib-Slight burning sensation/ Warmth there (Though it may have been from me poking and prodding at it)?-I feel as if it needs to..pop? Or something needs to click? (Every time I move I feel like whatever it is, it could move or slide out of..place.)?-There is NO BULGE. I've looked closely at my ribs, and I do not see any abnormalities there.?I've always had a popping/clicking in my left rib when I did certain things like take deep breaths or lay down certain ways, where I can press into my rib and it clicks- but I was told that that is normal for ribs to do (even though I've never felt my right one do it). I do not know if it has any correlation to this tightness/burning sensation, but it seems to always be the left rib being funky.?I'm a CNA, so I do heavy lifting on a day-to-day basis. Could it be a pulled abdomen muscle??My overall question is: Could this be a hernia, and do I need to see a doctor?If I do need to see a doctor, is there a specific kind of doctor I should be seeing? I don't have a personal doctor, and I don't have insurance that covers checkups so- this would be out of pocket (which I REALLY don't want to do at all).?Note: The picture is where the discomfort/burning is coming from."

I take lots of Tums multiple times a day and have elevated the top of my bed a few inches to minimize the chance or reflux during the night. I also avoid certain foods or coffee late evening to avoid problems. Several years ago I first noticed a sensation of not being able to breathe if I bend over such as when tieing my shoes or putting on socks. It's just a sensation but it scares me a bit. I'm now a retired 69 year old with no other health problems, have normal to even low BP, heart always checks normal, lung function always checks ok too. So with all these positive health exam issues out of the way I was just really confused as to why I get these unexplained breathing issues. Well I'm retired but still take occasional free-lance jobs. Latest was in Peru at high altitude, 4350 meters. I've been on many assignments at high altitude before but not quite this high and not for as long a time. I was fine for first week but started getting shortness of breath from even the slightest exertion. Our camp doctor checked my pulse rate and O2 levels everyday and said everything was normal in fact very good for a man my age even though I could hardly breathe or maybe just the sensation of not being able to breathe otherwise why would my O2 saturation levels be in the 90's? My condition seemed to worsen during the second week until at day 13 I started panicking every time I lay down flat. I would start breathing rapidly and still feel I wasn't getting enough air . For 13 hours that night I couldn't sleep getting this feeling if I went to sleep I would never wake up. Next morning I again saw the doc who said I had a severe case of bronchitis and decided to order my descent back to our acclimation area in a town at 3.1K meters. At least the panic attacks are gone but still have breathing issues and the sensation of not being able to breathe when bending over is there worse than ever. A couple days ago a good UK friend, retired SAS commando and now private security for US based firm updated his condition on FB for all to see.

I do attend the gym but for much light hearted activities like body step, I do too much lifting to want to do any extra. I have always been naturally strong. One night while suffering from a persistent cold I had a sudden pain on the lower quarter of my abdomen, with sharp shooting pains going down my thigh. I went to A&E but due to the large area of pain and my xray showing lots of feces they fobbed me off with constipation pains and gave me some pain killers (codine).Eventually after two days I was diagnosed with a urine infection, but there wasnt any blood in my urine, they decided this as I had no urge to go to the toilet even though my bladder was quite full. The antibiotics worked, so there was something not right with my bladder, but I still had a large mass of pain in my right side as the doctor put it ""your bits"", was given antibiotics for pelvic inflammation and that cleared up. All I was left with now was a sharp pain in between my belly button and pelvic area, groin pain and shooting pains like sciatica down my thighs, it was if a nerve was trapped above in my abdomen. I went straight to my GP and she diagnosed a femoral hernia.My other symptoms were nausea, bowel problems - I was forced to go on a strict fibre/mushy diet as I couldnt eat enough due to feeling full quite quickly, in other words something was stopping my normal bowel flow and only very well chewed food would pass through. I did try laxatives but they caused me so much pain, I could feel the feces pass this bulge/obstruction and it hurt. So no bread, steak, heavy food. I also felt very tired and would have to sit down if I started my normal routine. When I stood I could feel pain from my groin area and even sitting caused me to feel uncomfortable. But lying down on the sofa made the pain virtually disappear. I could do certain exercises/actions which didnt cause pain or make my hernia worse ie. jumping up and down on a soft surface, twisting, dancing moves, but it would wear me out, I did notice a slight improvement after exercise but only say 4%.As well as all hernia symptoms I also had strange periods, more often and would stop suddenly. For 37 years I have never had problems with my periods. Also due to the pelvic inflammation and bladder infection my Consultant has his doubts about a hernia. Nowadays surgeons are far more careful, they dont want to be sued or have their career ruined with an operation that may cause the patient to sue them if they are not 100% sure. This problem flared up with chronic pain on the 23rd January 2012, since then due to my insistence that I have a hernia I have had a CT scan but that was while I was in A&E and it was thought I had kidney stones so my Inguinal canal/possible hernia area wasnt covered, otherwise all ok. I then had a private ultrasound due to the delay with NHS that showed all my female parts were ok but when I said I thought I had a femoral hernia we worked on trying to get it to show - a slight bulge (from his report) did show but the radiographer said he couldnt define it as a hernia. I then went to a private consultant with my radiologists report, my symptoms and some notes on my A&E admission. He suggested an MRI scan, so reluctantly I went. This showed no hernia but he has found a cyst. I believe the cyst has only appeared after my private ultrasound and is connected with the inflammation from the hernia. My first private ultrasound showed no cyst and I am confident he was doing a thorough job. I did realise after researching femoral hernias in ""Sports/athletes"" with women that are not menopausal that altered periods, bladder problems, bowel problems, shooting pains are all linked to a femoral hernia - and also a femoral hernia can be much harder to detect as quite often there isnt a lump (intestines coming through). Quite a lot of female hernias are in obese or older women so the young fit ones are normally sent to a gyne. or for groin strain problems. All I want is for it to be diagnosed, whether I have an operation is another matter. I met a lady at the ultrasound queue who had two symetrical femoral hernias, it had taken 2 years to be diagnosed. Her GP had told her that you couldnt get two and that her bowels shouldnt be affected, finally she demanded an ultrasound and replicated her work duties while having the ultrasound. She was a gymnast but was now teaching smaller children 4/5 years old and was not only assembling the apparatus which was heavy but lifting the children onto the bars which was heavy work. She was quite slight but looked in good shape. She was sitting next to me waiting for the US because she was getting her hernia pains back since having both hernias operated on 6 months later - so I am a bit worried about having an operation now - if it ever gets diagnosed. I shall have to think out of the box now and decide whether I could replicate my heavy lifting pain on an Ultrasound bed or stand up holding something heavy. This will be the only way I can tell if this ""bulge"" gets bigger and if there is a hole or just a weakness in the abdomen. If anyone can help with diagnosing a Femoral Hernia then this would be useful. I have tried to stick my fingers down into the area to locate the possible pain but I cant get a big enough pain to point it out. Sometimes the area throbs. And when I eat my shooting pain in the leg gets worse. In men they get shooting pain in their testicles (I think) but as I dont have male parts and it is a rare condition I am having difficulty getting a definite answer.I have an Indian friend whose mother has warned her of problems if she lifts heavy items, and a spanish friend whose female cousins in the north of Spain have all had hernias due to picking and lifting fruit in baskets, theirs mind you must have ruptured completely or within that fruit picking area or their doctor is very experienced with the problem.Femoral Hernias havent just arrived they must have been around since ""Eve"" why do the doctors not pool their information?If anyone has had a femoral hernia operation I would be very interested to find out how successful it was and if they have resumed a very active career as I want to do. Its better the devil you know sometimes I dont want ongoing problems if I have an operation with mesh and a laparoscopy. "

I had the hernia for about 10 years taking the usual medication (espomeprazol and ranitidine) in varying doses depending on the severity of the discomfort. The op itself was apparently very straight forward with the repair and the nissen fundoplication (where they wrap stomach around your esophagus) taking around 1 1/2 hours - albeit a blink of an eye to me! I was in quite a lot of discomfort (discomfort though and not pain) for the first 3 days and feeling weak from the lack of calories but am now moving better and not feeling as though I need to rest all the time. I have also started using complan to build calories and strength. Eating still a little hit and miss and am trying different things to gauge my bodies response to textures etc but as long as you are eating within your limits (i.e. take each stage sensibly) don't panic when something doesn't feel like it's going down as with relaxation and patience, it does eventually. I know my experience won't be the same as everyone, but I am kicking myself for not having had this done years ago."

I had laparoscopic surgery for an inguinal hernia on May 5, 2017. My recovery was good. 2 weeks out I felt just little pains. By week 5 I was completely out of pain. My surgeon instructed me to not do anything for 6 weeks following surgery. I followed that instruction and was feeling fine. So in week 7 I went to play golf, surgeon knew I played we talked about it prior to surgery. First time I played I felt some tightness in the surgery area but nothing else. It did not last. Then I played again a couple of days later and felt as similar experience. The following day I felt sharp stabbing pains with every step. Pain in some form has been with me ever since.When back to my surgeon who seemed to think it was the surgical tacks he put in to hold the mesh that may be the cause of the pain. He used absorbable tacks. Over the next month my pains have gotten less. The sharp stabbing pains are gone. I now just have small random ones on inactive days and pains that crop up on more active days. I use ice to re-leave the pain. I don't require pain medications. However I do not have any pain free days anymore. My daily activities are greatly curtailed. I just saw my surgeon again and he had me get an ultrasound with valsalva maneuvers. I see him again next week for the results. I don't know what comes next or what I should expect.I would appreciate any input here and advise. "

I started having stiffness in my neck. That's how is started....over the years until now my symtopms would be all over the place. I just recently got diagnopsed with a Hiatal Hernia FINALLY!!! I had a reason to my symptoms. Problem is that throughout the years I developed anxiety from my sympotoms, I cant tell you how many times I was in the E.R. thinking I was having a heart attack. I had multiple EKG's done and all came back normal (Doctors always preceeded asking me ""Do you have anxiety?"" I would laugh and admit it, but I am not characterized by this at all.I have been to so many different Doctors over the years and everything comes back normal so..... unfortunatly while I finally know what I have I am left with anxiety. Every little thing I feel I start to freak out! I can't help it. On top of that everything is in my chest. I get weird aches and pains, burning feelings here and there (nothing major, but enough to freak me out) sometimes I get pains in my shoulders and I freak out, or I get a pain on my chest (which usually feels surface level) and I freak out. I can't tell the difference between anxiety and the real thing.I have learned that this Hiatal Hernia sucks really back and because of what it does in my chest just make it worse. I promise the pain has never been major, its just enough to pester my mind and keep it on high alertThis is what I want to knowAm I the only one?

Here are my views, will be updated regularly.I'm a very active and fit 23 year old. I do not do any gym exercises and my work isn't very strenuous at all. Never had any muscle issues or strains before in my life.December 2015. Was at work, felt a sharp pain in my groin and panicked thinking I had a testicular torsion again after having one 3 years earlier and requiring emergency surgery to fix it. Off to the hospital I went who misdiagnosed me with a possible STI. 3 misdiagnoses later at doctors and walk-in centres I was sent for a scan in Feb 2016 and diagnosed with a right inguinal hernia, finally.DAY OF OP - Fast forward to 25/07/2017 and I was finally on my way to the hospital for my surgery at QE Birmingham. No eating from 11PM the night before, no fluids after 6AM (only water) that morning. Arrived at 7.15AM, in my bed by 7.30AM. Shortly after I had a visit off the nurse, who told me I was first on the list (what a shock, expected to be waiting for hours!) and checked my heart rate and asked the usual questions, allergies any broken skin or conditions they should know of etc. Visits off the consultant surgeon, consultant anaesthetist and a second visit off the nurse followed. On my way to the theater at 8.20. Next thing you know I'm waking up at 10.25 in recovery, feeling brilliant. No pain, no groggy feeling, overall very positive about it all. Took a shot of morphine as it was offered to me. By 1.20PM I was in the car with my dad on the way home. Rest of the day was fine, walking around was weird due to the numb feeling in the area operated on, as well as the mental side of trying to not put too much pressure on it.DAY 1 POST OP - Had a great sleep, woke up feeling fine, the incision was slightly sore but nothing too painful. Sharp shooting pains when walking or turning but easy to put up with. Couple hours later I couldn't even move. Pain was absolutely excruciating, stuck in same standing position for 10 minutes due to not even being able to shout nobody (even that was incredibly painful). Took some prescribed codeine and paracetamol and was assisted to sit down in a chair until they kicked in, this was also extremely painful. Throughout the day this pain persisted, getting easier the more that I moved around especially with the effects of the painkillers in my system. Last few hours of the day were spent in bed to relax, feeling pretty worn out due to the pain and suffering throughout the day.DAY 2 POST OP - Sleep was good, didn't wake up at all. Back was aching and a dull ache in the groin area where the incision was made. Took some more codeine and paracetamol tablets and began to make my way downstairs. Pain is a bit better today, still moving pretty gingerly but able to move around unassisted so far. Done a 5 minute walk around the house an hour after waking up, plan to do some more throughout the day.Will be updated."

I'm not sure the specific type of surgery, but the surgeon said that I'd be able to resume heavy lifting in just a week. About 8 hours after I got home I noticed a lump in my scrotum. Visually it appears exactly the same as the hernia. It seemingly comes from the same spot (abdominal wall) and has the same muscly texture. It started to get extremely tender to the touch by the second day.I called my surgeon the first day and he dismissively told me over the phone that it was just swelling. The next day he called me and said that it could also be fluids. I do certainly have areas of fluid but this patricular thing is not a fluid. He said that I had a big hernia, but that he ""tied it all back"" so he can't imagine it being an early recurrence.So I waited over the weekend and the swelling got slightly worse on the third day, but has remained the same for the last 2 days. I called his office today to see if he could just look at it and ... he's on vacation this week. Seriously. I spoke to a nurse who simply said that ""swelling and fluids are common. See if it goes away tomorrow."" Clearly even normal swelling doesn't simply go away in a day. I asked her if there were any signs to look out for if it was a recurrence and she only mentioned a fever and pain when peeing.I was never given any specifics about the swelling beforehand. I assumed that swelling meant swelling of the incision area or of the testicles. Is it normal for swelling of something else that would mimic an inguinal hernia (as in seemingly penetrate the abdominal wall and enter the scrotum)? Also, is there a way to be able to tell the difference between normal swelling and a recurrence?"

My doctor says that I also have nerve damage after the surgery and I was left having to use a wheelchair for travelling outside of my house.

I think that it is important that I mention that I suffer with Fibromyalgia, Chronic Pain Syndrome, Hyperalgesia, Tietze Syndrome, Endometriosis and a whole host of other delightful chronically painful conditions; I also have Bipolar and other mental health issues. I have had quite a lot of surgery and basically can feel the pain in all of my scars as if I've just had the operations done.The more they operate the worse my conditions become. I was taken to A&E on Saturday morning with pain so bad it was making me vomit, the surgeons checked me over and said they cannot operate as it would worsen my condition (I do understand that they have a duty to heal, not harm) and I'll be honest, I am not keen on having more surgery. I have a beautiful daughter who is a young carer and is my angel, she needs me functioning as best as I can, thinking, conversing with her and encouraging her to thrive! She needs me to be her mother, not her patient. The pain medication leaves me pretty much off my face and unable to process my thoughts clearly. I was told on Saturday that The opiates are pretty much the only valid option I have along with a trip to the pain management team who have previously refused to put me on their pain management programme because of the depression that I suffer due to my conditions. I understand that too though.I am nearing my wits end, I wasn't told that the hernia surgery could leave me in this state and now I'm stuck with this stuff inside me :'( The mesh isn't my only source of pain but it is a massive contributing factor. There are times when the pain is SO bad that I actually wish I could just die! (I won't, I'm too stubborn and my father's suicide when I was 15 means to me that I would never do that to my daughter)Is my life going to be either being heavily medicated for the pain and completely unable to function or being in so much pain on a daily basis that I'm physically I'll and unable to enjoy the time that I have left?

I think that it is important that I mention that I suffer with Fibromyalgia, Chronic Pain Syndrome, Hyperalgesia, Tietze Syndrome, Endometriosis and a whole host of other delightful chronically painful conditions; I also have Bipolar and other mental health issues. I have had quite a lot of surgery and basically can feel the pain in all of my scars as if I've just had the operations done.The more they operate the worse my conditions become. I was taken to A&E on Saturday morning with pain so bad it was making me vomit, the surgeons checked me over and said they cannot operate as it would worsen my condition (I do understand that they have a duty to heal, not harm) and I'll be honest, I am not keen on having more surgery. I have a beautiful daughter who is a young carer and is my angel, she needs me functioning as best as I can, thinking, conversing with her and encouraging her to thrive! She needs me to be her mother, not her patient. The pain medication leaves me pretty much off my face and unable to process my thoughts clearly. I was told on Saturday that The opiates are pretty much the only valid option I have along with a trip to the pain management team who have previously refused to put me on their pain management programme because of the depression that I suffer due to my conditions. I understand that too though.I am nearing my wits end, I wasn't told that the hernia surgery could leave me in this state and now I'm stuck with this stuff inside me :'( The mesh isn't my only source of pain but it is a massive contributing factor. There are times when the pain is SO bad that I actually wish I could just die! (I won't, I'm too stubborn and my father's suicide when I was 15 means to me that I would never do that to my daughter)Is my life going to be either being heavily medicated for the pain and completely unable to function or being in so much pain on a daily basis that I'm physically I'll and unable to enjoy the time that I have left? I am only 37! Has anybody else had this problem and what did you do?Warmest RegardsJenni x"
"hernia","Incisional hernia painful followed by vomiting","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/incisional-hernia-painful-followed-by-vomiting-599422","Hi everyone,I had half my stomach removed 12 months ago. Several months ago I noticed a lump just above my belly button, it is an incisional hernia that has got bigger and at times painful.This morning I woke at 5am with a very painful stomach where the hernia is, the pain went through to my back, the pain didn't go away and around 9am I was vomiting, 6 times actually and twice there was no warning, it just seemed to fly out of my mouth. Not pleasant.I don't know if it's symptoms of the hernia or if maybe it was food poisoning as I had a frozen pizza last night that had beef on it, something I don't normally eat as since the removal of half the stomach, I'm only suppose to eat very small meals and eat them slowly, I mean to the point they become cold. I feel a lot better now, 3.5 hours after I vomited last. Still slightly painful.Does anyone know if it was complications with the hernia, if the pain would go away? Or does the pain stay. My stomach is also very bloated and been that way for months, so bloated I no longer have a belly button, it looked very weird after the operation last year anyway and has now ended up flat. I have an appointment with a specialist in 2 weeks time, but I have been told that the waiting list in Australia for hernia operations can be up to 2 years.I can't help but think I did this to myself as after the stomach operation I went back to doing everything as I used to, housework, lifting heavy thing, even lifted my 38 kilo dog off the bed once, taking him for walks where he constantly pulled and lunged forward.It's now 5.40pm and there's hardly any pain and I haven't eaten all day. If I wake again with that pain and vomit again, I'm scared it might be the strangulation of the hernia. My very busy doctor is booked out until next week, so I'll go to A&E.I would really apprciate anyone that can help me with some of the questions.Thank you and take care.Sue"

I am extremely open to other womens experiences, their advice, debate on what I have discussed. I have to complete it by writing a Part 2. My GP had to diagnose me twice, the second time she told me I had a femoral hernia I listened (I didnt believe her the first time). Hernia me???? Unfortunately my Consultant, US scans (3), MRI, CT scan didnt back her up! I DONT HAVE A LUMP/BULGE.I will start with three articles that I have found which are very enlightening, they do explain what I am discussing but are probably better written and use medical terminology which I lack. Google :In Women, Hernias May Be Hidden Agony (NYTimes.com)His and Her Hernias: Pelvic Culprit Tough to Diagnose in Women(Huffingtonpost, Los Angeles)Hernias in Women : Uncommon or Unrecognized?(Laparoscopytoday.com)If you put in Femoral Hernia in Google you get a very simplistic set of causes, symptoms. But if you do more research and delve much deeper you will find that there is much more connected with a Femoral Hernia. A femoral hernia (and maybe other hernias in women I am not sure) can be caused or can start with a weakness in the abdomen wall:Weakness of muscle/abdomen (in the family, speak to your relatives) Result of surgery (C.Sec./abdominal surgery in the past)Heavy lifting (relative to how strong you are, see below)Sports (running, cycling, martial arts, any exercise you are pushing yourself, straining)Straining during bowel movements (bad diet, not enough fluids)Fluid in the abdomen (in one of the articles - havent the faintest what that is)Being overweight (added pressure on the organs)Colds (pneumonia, or just coughing a lot)Sneezing (presumably violently!)Pregnancy or giving birth (could weaken the abdominal wall/muscles)The heavy lifting will be relative to how strong you are, I have discovered that my friends female cousins in Northern Spain have all had hernias as they pick and carry fruit on a regular basis. Lifting at work, met a female while waiting for my NHS ultrasound who was a gymnast but now coached young children. She would assemble the bars and regularly lift the children onto the apparatus, she believed that caused her hernias, yes two, left and right. Sports, horseriding, running, weight training, etc. If you google forums where sports men and women chat you will find hernias are quite common ""Runners World"" etc. Symptoms:A femoral hernia (and maybe some other types, I am not sure) can be either on the right side, causing pain/problems, on the left side, causing pain/problems or you could have one on the right and the left. I only know you can get one either side as the woman I met while waiting for a NHS ultrasound had had two symmetrical ones that had been operated on. Her symptoms were shooting pains down both legs, groin pain left and right, bowel problems and pain on lifting, there may have been more but we didnt have much time to talk. She was there as her hernia symptoms had come back after being operated on 6 months prior. My symptoms and without going into long and detailed stories are as follows: Thrush, recurring, altered periods (previously fine), severe right groin pain, bladder infections and bladder weakness, numbness of right thigh, tiredness, bowels (feeling of fullness and (early on) pain while passing the infected area (hernia) now I just have to be very careful what to eat - fibre and more fibre. Constipation can not only be a cause (dont think mine) but it is a common symptom of a hernia, I read somewhere that the hernia can extract liquids from the feces causing constipation. If your intestines have come out and you have a lump you may experience different symptoms. Diagnosis:This is where I tear my hair out. There is a part 2 to follow. "

At the very beginning I assumed it was just an infection as it had a bit of a smell from it and was red looking but then the pain started to get worse. The pain isn't awful but it is definitely noticeable and can get worse at night when trying to turn in bed. I had a better look a couple of days ago and freaked out when I found a lump inside my belly button near the top. It's soft but it's quite firm and can't be pushed back in. Every morning when I wake up my belly button and the surrounding area feels wet and is smelly. I have anxiety disorder so I'm feeling really stressed out and nervous over this, I'm terrified about going to the doctor."

"hernia","Hiatus Hernia or something more serious? ","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hiatus-hernia-or-something-more-serious--73160","I suspect I have a hiatus hernia, but I'm also worried it could be something serious and I won't find out until I have an endoscopy, which could be months away. I really need someone to reassure me that I am experiencing a hiatus hernia, and not something more urgent or severe, and possibly give me some tips for dealing with this. Some background: I started having breathing problems in October, followed quickly by severe throat pain and swallowing difficulties. Several visits to walk-in clinics and the GP later, after misdiagnoses with asthma and mumps, a doctor finally suggested I might be experiencing acid reflux. At the time I was generally only having 'silent' laryngopharyngeal silent, including a sore throat, lump in throat, and trouble swallowing. My symptoms didn't improve with 60 mg of Omeprazole so they began treating me for h. pylori (without confirming it with tests) or possibly an ulcer. Eventually I started having the more recognisable symptoms of acid reflux, although they primarily seem to be concentrated below my breastbone, right at the solar plexus. Eventually I was switched to Lansoprazole, 30 mg 2x a day, and although it's worked better than the Omeprazole my symptoms have never entirely gone away and recently seem to have gotten worse. I've been eating a very bland diet for months, without effect. No caffeine, no alcohol, no tomato sauce, no chocolate, very little sugar, no... just about everything. During a 3 week period at the very beginning I ate nothing but toast, plain whole wheat pasta, and bananas and drank nothing but warm water and still my symptoms didn't improve. Finally, at the beginning of January my GP referred me to a gastroenterologist, suspecting it might be a hiatus hernia. My pain has been escalating recently and I was very eagerly checking the mail everyday for the appointment letter. However, during a confrontation with a very inept, awful GP at the surgery today, I discovered that the practice may, in fact, not have sent out the referral (the hospital department has no records of my referral, although they explained it could still be processing), leaving me nearly a month behind in my journey to heal this problem. Because even seeing a gastroenterologist and getting an endoscopy will likely now be months away for me, on top of the three months I've already suffered, I'm becoming a little bit frantic. I'm now worried there's something else wrong with me, like possibly stomach cancer, and that all this medical incompetence will kill me. (These are the same doctors who prescribed me two drugs with a very serious interaction--irregular heartbeat--and then dismissed me as 'overreacting' when I turned up at their office with.... heart palpitations, dizziness, fainting episodes. I only discovered the interaction myself days later when I was checking the interactions on my meds to see if I could take a decongestant. Stopped one of the meds and all the dizziness and cardiac problems disappeared. Anyway, these doctors don't exactly inspire confidence.) SYMPTOMS- pain and difficulty with deep breaths (My partner pointed out that I 'raise' my shoulders to breathe. If you hold my shoulders down and try to get me to breathe just by expanding my lungs outward I sputter and cough and can't get a deep breath)- burning pain concentrated around solar plexus (under breastbone), usually worse after meals, somewhat improved by the lansoprazole: PPIs tend to reduce the burning but not the general pain- soreness and tightness in throat- muscular pain in chest, left armpit, left arm, left hand (I don't think this is cardiac: i've had it for months and the pain is worse when I move, press on it.)I've had a blood test (i'm iron deficient but not anemia), a chest x-ray, a stomach x-ray, and a lung capacity test, all of which were relatively normal. Would the hernia have shown up on one of the x-rays though? That's my concern. If I don't have a hernia I don't know what this is: it seems more complicated than simple GERD. I apologise if I come off a little frantic. I'm frustrated and exhausted and a little terrifying. I'm seriously considering shelling out the £1,000 or so for a private endoscopy but apparently you also need a referral for one of those too and I don't trust my GP to actually send it out. Money is tight anyway. I'm trying to get into a new GP next week but with their preliminary appointments and wait times I doubt I'll get another referral out for at least 2 weeks. I doubt I'll have the endoscopy before June. I just don't want to find out months later, when my NHS referral finally trickles in, that I've been living with say, stomach cancer they could have treated if they'd caught it earlier. I'd be very young for stomach cancer, I know (I'm in my twenties) but with months to go before diagnosis my mind is running a little wild. The relentless pain and breathing problems is also tearing my nerves to shreds. I'm crying hysterically several times a day and I keep having fantasies about injuring myself so I'd have to be taken to an A&E and treated, or at least properly examined. Anyone have any strategies for coping with pain, or the wait until diagnosis? Everyone else seems to have been diagnosed fairly quickly with an endoscopy and I'm fighting even to see a gastroenterologist. : ( "

I am 50 and recently put on a bit of weight. I am the heaviest I've ever been, about 40 pounds over. I was diagnosed with a small umbilical hernia. I was surprised. I had no symptoms and had a scan before and they never saw it. I did have a laparoscopic surgery through my belly button and wondered if maybe it was actually an incisional hernia? I figured I would have been diagnosed with an umbilical hernia before now. They found it via an MRI while looking for the origin of right side pain. They did see a small ovarian cyst...so they thought maybe that was source of pain. Gynecologist Dud not agree. Was then sent for colonoscopy. Super healthy there. After that procedure I became painfully gassy ??. I found a deep massage to relieve the problem ?? And found that after that deep massage the right side pain was gone! I was elated! Shortly after that ... I began to have pain around belly button. It happened after I lifted a relatively light box. Then it became unbearable to have a waist band on my tummy. In the evenings I am so bloated it's crazy...I've never really bloated before. Lower back pain. I began to have a deep belly laugh and found immediately upon laughing my stomach felt exhausted and then hurt. My primary doc referred me to a surgeon. They have not called yet for consultation .So all that to say...tonight I am in pain. It's not excruciating... but I do have a high threshold for pain. It hurts when walking...when getting up.it feels very bruised to touch it...or if I barely brush against counter.All that to ask...all you hernia experts...( I say that because so many of you have lived though it )... Should I wait to go into the surgeon? I have no idea how long it will be. Does the pain warrant a trip to ER? (I hate ER).

"hernia","Horrible hiatal hernia symptoms ","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/horrible-hiatal-hernia-symptoms-588535","Hi everyone. My name is Jake, I'm a 27 year old male. I have chest pains daily. They last for seconds, minutes, hours, or throughout the day. Sometimes I get them as soon as I wake up and almost always after eating. They’re usually localized to one small area. They feel sharp and stabbing, sometimes dull, usually on the front left chest but sometimes it happens on the front right chest, middle of my chest, or on the sides under my arms. I have had 3 EKGs, two chest x-rays, an echo, a stress echo, all came back negative for heart disease. I also get palpitations like my heart is pounding when I lie down flat. It feels like my whole chest, back and abdomen are throbbing. It sometimes happens after eating too. Sometimes it feels like a lot of pressure in my upper chest and neck too when the palpitations happen. I was also having tachycardia when all of these symptoms started last summer. My heart rate was 100-120 at rest. My primary Dr. prescribed propranolol for chest pains, palpitations, and tachycardia. My HR is now 60-70 at rest. I’m still having chest pains and palpitations. I’m also experiencing tightness, soreness, and pain in my throat and jaw like something is stuck in my throat. It’s worse when lying down or sitting up and putting pressure on my upper back, sides, or chest (pretty much my whole ribcage). It makes me cough and it feels like I can’t breathe fully, but I have no trouble breathing. It feels like something is in my chest, putting pressure on my throat and upper back between my shoulder blades and at the base of my neck. I have no relief with allergy medication or my rescue inhaler. I have acid reflux and indigestion daily and regurgitation 2-3 times a week. It has gotten worse over the past 2 weeks. I had been taking Prilosec OTC for about a year before my GI doctor started prescribing it to me. She had me on Rx Prilosec for 3 months then she switched me to ranitidine for 3 months and Prilosec again for 3 months. I’m due to go back to her again soon and she said she wants to have me do one more 3 month round of ranitidine. I had an upper endoscopy done at the end of November last year and it revealed a hiatal hernia. I also had a barium swallow under fluoroscopy which also confirmed reflux, indigestion, regurge, and the hiatal hernia. After the last 3 months of ranitidine, my GI doctor said that’s when we’ll discuss surgery for the hernia repair if my symptoms don’t get better. The Prilosec isn’t working as well as it used to. I have eliminated all trigger foods from my diet, no citrus, chocolate, caffeine, tomato, pineapple, spicy foods, fried foods, garlic, bananas, alcohol, etc. I reduced sugar and carbs as well and I’m eating smaller meals throughout the day. I have nausea everyday. I almost always get nauseous after eating anything and stomach/abdominal cramps and pains. I’m always fatigued despite a full night of sleep. I’m also getting headaches and upper back pains in between my shoulder blades and upper back. I’m just not feeling well overall, especially when all symptoms occur together. It’s difficult to function throughout the day some days. I’m just feeling miserable. I know all of these symptoms are caused by the hiatal hernia but they’re unbearable sometimes. My primary doctor said the hiatal hernia is most likely irritating my vagus nerve which controls heart rate, digestion, some muscles in the neck, throat, chest, and abdomen, which explains a lot. I just get panicked sometimes especially when I have chest pains and abdominal pains even though it's unlikely it's my heart or some other life-threatening condition. Does anyone else have a hiatal hernia with symptoms as severe? Do you have anything you do for relief? What about the hernia repair surgery, has anyone had a nisson done or the linx? Any advice or anything would really help."

I suffered a cecal volvulus (twisted bowel) on 7/9/2015 and required an emergency laparotomy/hemicolectomy as it was a life threatening situation. I was cut from my bikini line to just under my breast bone. It was a major surgery. I was very lucky it was caught on time and it has been a very traumatic time.My hernia repair which was done only six weeks after my other surgery has been much more painful recovering from, even though surgeons say it's a relatively simple operation. There is no way I was expecting this after what I had already been through.When I arrived home from hospital after my first surgery I subsequently noticed a prominent bulge in my right groin which was diagnosed as a large inguinal hernia containing small bowel loops. All I needed after such a major scare and major operation with the laparotomy/hemicolectomy.Anway, the operation for my right inguinal hernia repair was an open procedure. The operation went smoothly and initial pain in waking in recovery and the next couple of days was not bad at all. From then on OUCH. Getting in or out of bed or out of the recliner chair the burning, stabbing and sharp pains as described by many men after inguinal hernia repair were the same. This lasted several days.My illioinguinal nerve was also cut so I have had major nerve pain in my mons pubis area till this day. Fortunately today which is nearing day 35 post op I think I might be seeing just the slightest light at the end of the tunnel in relation to nerve pain. I was prescribed pain killers and Lyrica for the nerve pain, but gave up on them after becoming very sick and nauseous as they did not agree with me.So hopefully I will be lucky and this nerve pain will subside in time as I have practically been bedridden on many days because of this. I was told it can take years or never go away, but I have my fingers crossed I am not going to be one of those statistics.I will keep you informed of my progress."

I also have no gall bladder so it can't be that. For about two months I've been experiencing pain around my belly button, where I had an umbilical hernia repaired with mesh 8 years ago. My GP brushed it off as no big deal. 2 days ago the pain became unbearable. I can barely walk, bend, or move. The area all around, for several inches out in every direction is rock hard and painful, slightly worse to the right. Today a circular bruise formed around my belly button.

"hernia","Hiatal hernia?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hiatal-hernia--570600","Hi all just wondering if you can help me out with a few questions as I'm abit stuck at the moment.Is it possible that a hiatal hernia could be missed on an endoscopy or a barium swallow? I ask this because although I have been displaying all of the symptoms for the last 2 years I have had 2 endoscopies and one barium and they have picked up nothing whatsoever. my symptoms are - can't take a full breath unless I yawn/ lean forward slightly. Regurgitating good as it seems to get stuck in my esophagus but this is usually when I'm sitting down, it ranges from me not being able to drink water to being able to gulp very thick milkshake. Heartburn where it feels like my stomach opens if that makes sense? I mean I have no problems chugging gaviscon when this happens. If I look down at my stomach it the left upper abdomen is often raised higher than the other side. From any of your experiences does this sound familiar? I'm driving myself crazy here 😂Thanks."

"hernia","Umbilical hernia repair ","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/umbilical-hernia-repair-569865","I'm now 9 days post op for a repair of an umbilical hernia. It's been quite an experience as I'm sure many here will identify with. Firstly, it's been a bit more of a deal than I was first led to believe; I got short notice for the surgery itself and the secretary suggested I'd be able to drive a few days afterwards... so yes, she's not medically trained. I am perhaps being impatient but it's still quite sore, again with the little information I was given, this seems to be about right. I've been struggling with doing almost nothing (the good news is I've not even done the dishes in almost two weeks) and trying to run the gauntlet of not sitting still too much with not being too active also - last few days I'm managing a very slow walk outdoors. My wound is much larger than I'd expected, my stomach now looks like the jokers face. I managed to have a good look at things yesterday after changing my dressing and it looks exactly the same! 😔 There is still a lump apparently poking its way across what's left of my bellybutton which was what alerted me to going to the GP in the first place. I'm now trying not to panic! For those of you who've undergone umbilical hernia repair, does any of this ring true? Should I be panicking? I've an appt with my GP in a few weeks time which was mainly to get a 'sick note' as I've agreed with work that I'd be off just a little longer than the 4 weeks the surgeon had suggested. I'm worried that the surgery hasn't worked... given it looks exactly the same (short of a great big scar across my stomach now). I'm very much considering ringing the hospital and asking if a follow up appointment can be arranged as I'd love to be convinced all is well... it certainly doesn't look like it though! "

"hernia","Rolling hiatus hernia and gastric volvulus","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/rolling-hiatus-hernia-and-gastric-volvulus-34934","First of all, thanks to others for sharing your experiences on this forum, now it's my turn!I've been having problems eating a normal size meal for about 18 months now (gastric pain / reflux/vomiting after eating). I first went to my GP after about 3 months and was given Omeprazole first, then Lansoprazole, neither of which worked. I had an ultrasound to check for gallstones (negative) and about a year ago went on the waiting list for an endoscopy. After about 4 months of waiting my GP managed to get me bumped up the waiting list as \""urgent\"" because the medication wasn't working. (At the time we were going on the guess that it might be an ulcer). I eventually had an endoscopy in late January (without sedation, just throat spray - bad decision, it was really miserable and I retched solidly for about 20 minutes during the procedure), and they decided that I had an intrathoracic pylorus (basically my stomach was all twisted and partly in my chest cavity) so sent me for a barium swallow a few weeks later which showed a large hiatus hernia. Fast forward to July when I eventually had an appointment with the consultant endoscopist to tell me all this officially, and refer me on to the surgical team. After the hernia diagnosis my GP had put me onto Metoclopramide but it hasn't honestly made much of a difference. I saw the surgeon in mid August and they described the condition as gastric volvulus with hiatus hernia and that they will do a laparoscopic fundoplication with an anterior wrap (hopefully has fewer side-effects than a full wrap) and put me on the urgent list as the symptoms aren't managed by drugs.So I had a phone call last Thursday evening saying that they'd had a cancellation and would I like to come in for my operation on Tuesday (tomorrow!) so after a quick (15 mins) pre-op assessment on Friday, I'm now in the final stages of waiting for the big day. I have a bit of a cold unfortunately so there is the chance that tomorrow they'll decide I'm not fit. Hopefully not, as I've spent the last 4 days doing a massive handover of all my projects to my colleagues - it would be a bit of a let down to walk back into the office on Wednesday saying \""I'm back!\"" but ultimately it's about what's safe and best for my recovery. I'm rather apprehensive about the general anaesthetic (never had one before), the post-op pain/discomfort and the whole \""soft diet\"" challenge coming up over the coming weeks, but if it puts an end (eventually) to the misery of not being able to eat a normal meal without cramping and vomiting, it'll be worth it in the end. Wish me luck!"

I ended up with racing heart and panic that lasted for over three hours. I was scared but burped and rode it out. I just figured it was a really bad panic attack. I ended up taking lorazapam and eventually fell asleep from exhaustion.I figured that would be the last of it, but noooo... a few days later I experienced another attack. Not as severe but still scary. I noticed that during these attacks I would have to burp and burp and burp somehow that seemed to bring my heart rate down. (I have a hiatal hernia) so I have had burping episodes before but never with heart rate going crazy.Jan 26th rapid heatbeat 120 bm, burping, lots of noise from intestines and stomach and sometimes I get acid reflux with bitter taste but most other times I get reflux that is clear with some foam. I have to force it out and it feels like it is coming from my stomach through a little tube up my chest and out with lots of air and gurgling (sry, gross I know).Went to doc and explained what was going on she did blood test all negative, ekg and said it was good, set me up with stress test which was good except for two etopic beats so doc ordered a 30 day event monitor.During this time I have another episode of heart racing and call to see my doc ... she wasn't in office so saw different doctor who has me come in and says I'm slightly dehydrated and thinks my issue is my gallbladder. He sends me to ER where they give me fluids, labs and ultrassound of upper adominal and says I have a large gallstone (knew this since 2012) He refers me to gallbladder surgeon and gives me meds for pain and nausea (I never said I was in pain or nauseous) UGH why don't they listen.I go to the gallbladder surgeon who says he doesn't think it is my gallbladder and refers me back to my doctor suggesting her to send me to GI doctor for endoscopy and to be tested for h-pilory.During this time I saw one other doctor who said it was gerd and to take priolsec another ER doctor who checked my lungs with stethoscope and said it was my hiatal hernia and sent me home.All the while I have scary racing heart the event monitor people called to check on me yesterday because my heart rate was high enough to set off the parameters that the doc set for my heart rate. They wouldn't tell me how high it was but did say it was higher then 130 and I know my doc had set the max heart rate on my stress test 141. I am 5'4"" 209 lbs so that doesn't help and very unactive.I am just really scared because it is hard for me to understand why my heart rate is going crazy literally every day.As for reflux I did have some the other day and some times I feel like food moves really slow down my throat. I haven't been able to eat much for fear of setting off an episode so I am calorie deficient which doesn't help.I am currently taking prilosec and hoping maybe that will help, but I just can't wrap my brain around that this is all caused by gerd. My fears and anxiety tell me it is something more sinister and that I am going do die at any time.Sorry for such a long post, but I needed it all out since the doctors don't seem to listen.Anyone else have rapid heart rate off and on daily that just seemed to come out of no where?

"hernia","Inguinal Hernia Surgey Testicular Complication In Progress​?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/inguinal-hernia-surgey-testicular-complication-in-progress--562161","I guess I had a minor groin hernia for a since 2011, but it’s wasn’t bad enough to really be visible. The previous year it got noticeably, visibly worse, and it was diagnosed as a hernia. I had ED 2 weeks before surgery because I had made the bulge worse yet again. Also couldn’t cough, laugh or move moderately heavy things without pain in that area. Bulge was on the left side of the groin. I had traditional non mesh, open suture hernia surgery 6.5 weeks ago, mid December. First 4 days was sever cramping, was on narcotic pain meds for 9 days, I could barely walk. After the four days I started getting fluid build-up and it would leak downwards into my scrotum and my left testy would swell, but not serious pain, just heavy and sore. Could still have an orgasm but it was different. 4.5 weeks later I have noticed what comes out during sex is a little labored, and less then what it used to be before the surgery. My first week I iced 3-5 times a day, 2nd -3rd week iced 2-3 times a day, 4-6.5 week, iced 1-2 times a day. I would ice the inside of my left testy nearest the surgery area, and it seemed to make a difference in terms of pain and well being. At 4.5 weeks I have some extra fluid and heaviness in my testy area but not as much as before. At 4.5 weeks I could be able to sleep on my stomach with some discomfort in the surgery area and testis, and now I’m able to sleep on my stomach at 6.5 weeks after the surgery I have only minor discomfort and sleeping like this only caused me minor aching in my testis. At 6.5 weeks standing all day only gives me a little bit of grief in my testicles, with most of it being confined to the left side. In all I get some minor dull ache in my left testy, with the right being a little more sensitive than before. I just started wearing jeans, this makes contact with the surgery area gives me minor grief. I have minor abdominal pain (above the incision) in a small area, when I move around, but nothing alarming. My problem is sex related. My ED is fixed, this works great, my penis has not shrunk everything is ok there. My problem lies with the amount of ejaculate that comes out. Before surgery, I would GUESS(I never measured), I would ejaculate, probably around 3.5-4ml, no crazy shooting but it would definitely come out without any problems and it would travel a bit, I never dribbled. Now after the surgery, it has ranged from anywhere from .8 to 2.2ml, and it has a lot of trouble coming out, it’s dribbling at its best, no travelling, there is barely any force at all. A couple of times it’ been very chunky. I’d say what comes out is half or less than half then before, and it varies, and hasn’t really improved since the surgery, where as before the surgery this was not a problem. At no time have I taken a step back during recovery, I haven’t lifted anything that has given me grief, I haven’t even had intercourse in case I traumatize this area, just very light stuff with the girlfriend testing things out. I started doing cardio on my elliptical at 5 weeks recovery time and have increased the intensity taking a day off in-between workouts as I get minorly sore in the area, but nothing to worry about. I went to the original surgeon three weeks after the surgery and he said it was healing properly. I asked if there was any problem with the spermatic cord or anything that could be problems or anything I should be concerned about, and he said no everything was fine, and it was just a hernia that was fairly large in size. At 3.5 weeks, and then again at 6.5 weeks I went to my regular doctor, and he wanted to inspect the hernia area, and he said its feeling fine. At 6.5 weeks I was supposed to go to my surgeon to get a final check up, but since this is now far away and I would have to pay for a hotel etc, and because I haven’t been working and have family problems and am broke, so I did not go. Instead I setup a phone consultation and I explained to him what is explained above for you all to read, and asked about the ejaculation problem. He said it sounds like the hernia is repairing, but the problem I am worrying about should not happen, and he thinks something else happened. I explained my concern, and he quickly said sometimes the testy can shrink, sometimes there is problems with the spermatic cord, and well you still have another testicle you can still have kids! (My testicle is not shrinking, at least not yet). My surgeon urged me to get my local doctor to book me into see a surgeon who performs these surgeries, or a urologist to get examined. When I went to my local doctor with this info, I asked him to get the OP report from my surgeon(in transit now) he says there is no need to worry, that I’m going to have problems and swelling in the area etc for up to three months. I had booked in an ultrasound to inspect the hernia area at 6.5 weeks and there is no fluid build up and the hernia looks like it has healed, there is no sign of it being there. I kept bugging him about the obvious and how even the surgeon said to go get it checked out because it’s shouldn’t be a problem but he said, no he won’t do anything until he sends me for a semen analysis test. I phoned today to make that appointment and they are 6 weeks backlogged!!! So guys, I’m not as bad off as some of you guys who I feel sorry for, I’ve read some pretty bad stories, So I’m not some drama queen, I’m just looking for some advice on what could be the problem and where to go from here. -Any idea what the problem is?- Should I just try to strengthen my pelvic floor muscles?- Do I need to go to a new local doctor immediately to get referred to a surgeon or urologist who can do a proper analysis? Is this a time sensitive thing where my testicle could be damaged- I don’t want to wait 6 weeks if there is a problem that needs to be looked at now. Can I do any exercises, do more icing, take more advil, go get a prescription for the problem?-Is my regular doctor right that I should just wait for things to heal more before I freak out?Thanks so much."

Recently I started having a lot of post nasal drip and foul taste in my mouth, then two weeks ago I started having a lump in my throat and the sensation of food coming back up my throat a ways before settling down. It seems worse earlier in the day but it's really freaking me out. I also have some back pains that come and go all of a sudden.The only thing that changed two weeks ago was I tried to start working out again after a long break. I did heavy (100lb) weighted cable crunches which put a lot of pressure on my abdomen, is it possible this could have brought on a hiatual hernia? Or aggravated one I already had? My mother and grandmother both have hernias and have taken PPIs for decades. I'm terrified this lump in my throat is esophageal cancer from years of silent reflux. "

Now, after moving to China with a heavy suitcase, my repair failed. Needless to say, I am very frightened and dissappionted.I have read that recurrance rates for second surgeries are abysmal- around 50%. I have no money or insurance, and I am in China. I'm not exactly keen on the thought of surgery right now. My instestine (or fatty tissue) has descended into testicale sack (scrotal hernia), which makes for a very yucky and vulnerable feeling. The sac is not overly bloated or engorged in appearance, and in the mornings the tissue ascends back in the body.I have a lot of other issues and details I would like to add but the main thing I want to stress is that I was never too keen on surgery in the first place and really considered natural healing (therapy and maintenance might be a better term), but my friends really pushed me hard toward the mesh and frightened, I gave in.What I'd like to know is what happens when the mesh has failed and the hernia has returned? Is it OK just to leave the implant in and go back to watch and wait and start a new physical therapy program? With failure rates of 50% and declining thereafter, I cannot see any sense at all to repeatedly traumatizing the body with surgery. However, I have not found information on people with mesh failures who leave the mesh in.My attitude now is that unless the condition becomes massive or causes severe pain, I don't particularly feel like messing with it.

My diet was awful but I had always been active (tennis player). I weighed about 225lbs and in a few months I've got that down to around 190-195lbs. In September when I was playing tennis I felt a sharp pain just above my junk and slightly to the right. Had no idea what it was. Kept playing for about 20 minutes in increasing pain before stopping. Went home to lie down and after about an hour it felt ok.I had no symptoms for about 3 weeks before having the pain again. I went to the GP who said it might be a hernia. Started getting the pain more regularly and after reading up realised I could hold it and push it in which made it better.I've been getting the pain more often, a couple of weeks ago it was every day but slightly less often since. I had started lifting weights as part of the desire to improve my health but have stopped that. Continued playing tennis but now wear a base layer which I think helps but regularly get the pain whilst or shortly after playing.So that's the situation. Currently reading around on the different treatment options. Any advice? Worried about the lack of choice I may have on the NHS regarding type of surgery and how long I might have to wait. Thinking about going private - does anyone have any experiences to share? The one I'm looking at is the National Hernia Centre in London (I'm from the north so would have to travel).Any thoughts or comments would be very much appreciated.

I have recently had to give up my job so this has severely affected mylifestyle. I have taken all the advise for diet,raising the bed, taking medication etc but this time around I am unable to free myself of symtoms. I have an appointment to discuss the option of surgery but, have read many stories here of people who have suffered a lot following the procedure.......help! What do I do?the alternative of doing nothing is making me miserable"

I was in surgery for about 2 hours. When I got to recovery I was very nauseous. I told the anesthetist about my problems with nausea and she gave me four different anti emetics to try and counteract that before I left sugery. Even that wasn't enough and they tried three more in recovery. Finally after five hours in recovery they were able to move my bed without my retching and get me to my room. I had a semi private and that was good as I had help if I needed it and some company. My shoulders were both sore in recovery and they put ice bags on them . That really helped. I was dreadfully dry after surgery but wasn't allowed to drink anything that day. I could swab my mouth with a wet sponge on a stick. I didn't take anything more than Tylenol for pain. I am allergic to coeidine and morphine. Pain hasn't been a big issue, just the nausea. The second day I was on a liquid diet and had soup and juices, milk, tea. The next day they allowed more changes in my diet and pudding was added and at lunch I was even allowed baked fish and rice with a cooked vegetable. Boy, that tasted good to a hungry person. I came home after lunch. I am taking Tylenol occasionally . I am getting a slight bit of pain in my shoulders a bit and some discomfort around my abdomen. I had a restless night last night. I am allowed to shower and really enjoyed standing under the warm water when I got home. The steri strips should come off in about 2 or 3 more days. I have five incisions. They don't bother me. This morning I had oatmeal with milk, and banana . So no more belching every time I eat ! I have to watch that I don't lift anything heavy for the next six weeks. I am very glad that this is over . I was getting pretty worried about before the operation but it wasn't that bad.Judy "

He was taken for surgery and it turned out that the hydrocele was formed due to an inguinal hernia, it had become strangulated, which was what was causing the pain, so it was repaired there and then and the next day he was sent home.Two months later another inguinal hernia appeared on the left and due to what had happened with the first one the Dr's didn't want to wait so performed surgery rather quickly and repaired it during day surgery.It has been 3 months since then and now it seems another hernia has popped out, this time on the right again but about an inch above where the first one was.

The surgery went well and the recovery too. There has been no problem with it up until now (apart from rare fleeting groin discomfort after I exercise a lot).Now, the thing is I have developed a small inguinal hernia on the left side. It doesn't pain much, neither there is any bulge, but there's occasional discomfort lasting a few hours to 2 days at max. The discomfort is not as bad as the one I had on the right side (before the surgery). I visited the same surgeon who operated my right side, and he suggested to get the left one operated too (although he said this time the hernia was small and that it could get bigger later on).I decided to delay the surgery this time. Its been 6 months now since the diagnosis, the discomfort has more or less remained the same (still no bulge), and I still can't decide on the surgery ? Any suggestions ?PS : I've insurance cover and it doesn't cost me anything to get operated. The only reason for delay is the fear of surgery (inspite of have undergone the procedure successfully once before) "

In May 2015, an infraumbilical hernia was detected in an USG. Though at the time I wasn't feeling any discomfort except for a lump. In March 2016, I had an episode of severe spasmodic pain in my lower abdomen and had to go to the ER where I was given painkiller through IV after which the pain subsided. They ran a CT scan which showed 4 hernias, with small bowel loops herniating through 2 of them. Infraumbilical on the left side and one on the right lateral side. They told me that all are reducible and not the cause of pain. Several other tests were run which discovered nothing else and they couldn't tell me what had caused the pain. The pain came back several times in the past two months and on going to another doctor I was told two hernias have become irreducible, another CT scan was done which detected 6 hernia. Now getting to the point of the matter, I have been advised surgery where they will put meshes over 4 of the hernias(umbilical, infraumbilical, right lateral wall and left lumber region) and then a ""larger mesh covering all four"". They said it will be a major surgery and I am very scared, reading about the complications possible with even single meshes and I will be getting 5. I want to ask about the experiences of people here who have had hernia repair done, especially if you have had multiple hernias repaired in one surgery then please post.Sorry, this turned out longer than I wanted it to, just feeling a bit on edge; thanks for taking time to read my post."

"hernia","Hiatus Hernia","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hiatus-hernia-533239","Morning all. I have suffered with acid reflux for at least the last 6 months with it getting progressively worse during that period. I have also had pain in my left shoulder and left hand side of my upper back (just below my shoulder blade) making it impossible for me to sleep laid flat (I thought i was getting another frozen shoulder but the pain is different) then 7 weeks ago I stopped eating. Within 24 hours I went from eating anything and everything to not wanting anything at all. 2 weeks later and over 1/2 stone lighter, i decided it was best to go to the docs. This took another week for the appointment by which time I had lost another 1/2 stone. She referred me for an urgent gatroscope which I had a week later and the results show inflamation from throat to stomach and beyond and a small (2cm) hiatus hernia. I was given Omaperazole which sorted the acid reflux. I was then sent for a CT scan as they were worried bout the dramatic weight loss (luckily I could afford to lose the weight but I was getting very weary by now having gone from 13 st 12 to 11 st 10 in this time), results in 2 weeks. I have had no sickness or diarhea but I have had serious pain in my back and chest if I eat meat, I have cosequently given up all meat. Some wheat products give me bad indigestion but not all. My question - can such a small Hiatus Hernia cause such huge problems? Are these symptoms normal for H H or could it be Gall Bladder problems as this has also been mentioned. I have asked all these questions but get very vague answers from doctors. I am getting a bit down now as I sleep (sort of) in a reclining chair and feel exhausted due to not eating properley.

Feel absolutely great now; no indigestion, no vomitting, no pain.However I have developed two incisional hernias - probably did too much to soon. One is to the left of the operational wound and is about 1.5 - 2.0 inches long (just feeling it with my finger) and my abdominal contents poke through most of the time except when lying down. It's a smal bulge, it would fit in my cupped hand (some of it will be my spare tyre!) and it is easily pushed back in. The other one is to the right of the wound and much smaller. I don't think it forms a bulge but after eating it is often, not always, sore. It goes after a while.I have consulted my GP and he says that hernias of this type are not normally repaired and if they are then they are likely to reoccur. He has told me that I should not lift anything heavy (what does heavy mean?).I have been referred to the surgeon that did the original operation for his advice, so I'll have to wait and see what he says. I like gardening, I am a church bellringer, I'm active, I like doing DIY stuff. I can't/don't want to go through the rest of my life not lifting anything that seems vaguely heavy.I have 2 inch wide ""Pirate's belt"" that I have never worn before but now I strap this on if I think I will be putting any strain on the area and it seems to help. I am thinking of getting a wieght lifter's belt which may do the job better - this pirate's belt has rather a large buckle!So, my questions to anyone who would like to chip in are;Should I push for a repair to the hernias?Does the NHS just not do hernia repairs unless it's life threatening or are they just saving money?Reading the experiences of some of you guys, will I get more problems if I do have the hernias repaired?Should I go privately? How much would that cost?Any comments will be gratefully received.Regards,Phil."

Today was abit different. I basically decided to go head to head in a polite way. I printed off the guidelines from the NHS regarding surgery. I pointed out the PPI were not helping, dietry changes were not helping I have heartburn at night especially when I lie on my left hand side. Then I showed her the guidelines of the treatment options on the nhs website. It stated when PPI and dietry changes are not effecticve and a person does not want to take medication long term surgery is an option. So I asked her to explain to me why I cant have the operation? The gp then basically said do you want the surgery? I said I would like a conversation with a surgeron in relation to this. She made the referral. I was in total shock. The bloating dioherrah and constipation has been horrendous since the hernia and enough was enough and I portrayed that in there, if she would of refused I would of asked for a second opionion and said I fully exercising all my rights! But didnt even need to do that. My digestion is imparied to me I have no option, I want to ask the surgeon about success rates, will my diet return to normal after the surgery if it is successful. I believe I have had some breathing problems since the hernia dismissed as anxiety so will ask a few questions in relation to that. If I get the answers I need I will then ask to do the op. Lets see. My gp left with a parting message. Most people with a hiatus hernia live a symptom free life with medication, unfortnately it looks like it is not helping you. Good luck.

After 3 more types of antibiotics I finally feel a but better insasmuch as I'm not as sensitive in that area. I saw my hospital doctor last week and he told me that it wouldn't have been an infection and that treating staph aureus with antibiotics encourages MRSA. He said that staph aureus was a normal occurence on the skin and would show on a swab. My GP believes I have been getting abcesses in the repair area. I have just checked the NHS website and staph aureus infections in wound sites are treated with antibiotics and do happen. Now I am starting to worry that my hospital doctor (who is usually lovely and helpful) just does not want to admit that things have gone wrong. My GO is concerned that the infection is in the mesh and consequently is not clearing up properly. I am still sore and swollen at the op site. I have had previous hernias repaired and have never had pain for this long even taking the seroma into consideration. I can't wear trousers or tights as the slight pressure around my wound site causes too much pain.After looking at the NHS site I am now really worried about the junior doctor I have been seeing at the hospital. Prior to this he was always happy to explain things to me and find out answers to any questions I had but now I feel he isn't taking me seriously. Does anyone have any advice?"

Ex smoker, probably drink a little more than average and asthmatic, but ideal weight for my build.I have a long list of reasons why I feel I may have a Hiatal Hernia and want to see if anyone can relate. I have had two doctors in the UK tell me I don't but I haven't had any tests and neither knew what a hiatal hernia was. One of them even laughed right at me because I'm too young to have one apparently. I had an alternative therapist tell me I certainly had one, then prescribed me with acupuncture, which I didn't follow through with due to skepticism and cost.My symptoms include:Acid reflux every single day, especially after coffee, orange juice, beer, fizzy drinks, milk or spicy/greasy food (which I mostly avoid these days).Tightness in my chest on and off at all times, especially upon waking.Hiccups and wind after almost every meal. This is worse if I eat too fast.General lethargy and shallow breathing even if I have had plenty of sleep and good food.And I can feel something which I can move around and pull down through self-massage. It's a visible lump that crunches back into place and sits just below and against my sternum. This ""lump"" (I'm pretty slim) can be forced back up, once pushed away, if I do sit ups or also after sex, which is real mood killer! Basically bending the abdomen at the hips, forward, seems to exacerbate it.I also suffer from sudden, but rare, pain in the chest, like especially bad heartburn, that is instantly alleviated through drinking a pint of water really fast. Something I discovered randomly many years ago.Please can anyone help me figure out if this is indeed a hernia!? Thank you.Lee"

"hernia","Inguinal Hernia Mesh Failure, Sx Months On","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/inguinal-hernia-mesh-failure-sx-months-on-501286","In corsidering possble surgery for a failed mesh repair three four months from now, I went to see a surgeon last month. I had a hand examination, and an ultrasound. He told me I may need surgery, but not right now (watch and wait in other words). My hernia has been easy to live with for the most part, but too much physical activity can cause pain. I stick to light yoga to keep muscles toned. I'm more flexible after the mesh failure than before- the mesh was pretty painful and made me quite rigid when bending down to pick something up. During vactation, the pain totally went away for about a month, and (aside from the mesh) any bulge disappeared as well. Most of the hernia also retracted from the scrotum, and has remained retracted. So it's not true that hernias can only get worse in time, though I have no opinion on whether they can heal or not. For almost everyone, I think not. The point is, I've expeirenced great improvement, and things have not gotten worse. As long as they stay like this, I'm not getting surgery. But I will get checked again in a few months. There is no doubt that I had to change my physical lifestyle drastically to live with a hernia. That's just how things are. It wasn't any better when the mesh was in place with all that pain. So take it easy is the way for me. Good thing I'm a teacher. Finally, here's a line from Wikipedia: ""Emergency surgery for incarceration and strangulation carry much higher risk than planned, ""elective"" procedures. However, the risk of incarceration is low, evaluated at 0.2% per year.[5] On the other hand, surgical intervention has a significant risk of causing inguinodynia, and this is why minimally symptomatic patients are advised to watchful waiting."" and ""Groin hernias that do not cause symptoms in males do not need to be repaired. Repair, however, is generally recommended in females due to the higher rate of femoral hernias which have more complications.""Well, obviously I have symptoms in terms of pain, and I believe it to be a result of inflamation and swelling when the area is stressed, not actual growth of the hernia (although that could be happening so slowly I'm just not noticing), but surgery- from my experience- just means even worse pain. And bowel strangulation rates are so low that I'm not even going to give that one thought. Chances of complications from surgery, however, are very high. At the strangulation rate my chances of cancer are greater per year.People, we all die sometime or something. Why are we so afraid of death? You think if you keep going back to surgery again and again for every thing you have you'll live forever? I've scoured the Net and boy, is it hard to find folks who advocate a watch and wait approach to this particular type of hernia. Everyone wants a quick fix or they're scared they're going to die. The worst advice I've heard is 'get the surgery done before your insurance runs out.' Wow. Well, I'm just telling my experience and trying to offer here what I think is a sane approach to the extremely common inguinal hernia. I've opted for surgery, and it didn't work. If I get surgery again, stats say that it will fail again are 50%. But I've never actually heard of anyone dying from this type of hernia yet. Maybe others had. We are fragile, mortal creatures.

Diagnosed with a HH some 15 years ago I underwent a Nissen Fundoplication and more recently I have suffered a heart attack (unbeknown to me until scan revealed heart muscle damage) and have been stented so as you would expect I am under the care of a cardiologist. Several spells of intense pain and palpatations have seem me visit A&E on a few occasions and of course my cardiac history ensures I am pretty fully tested. Each time conclusion is that I have suffered a severe gastric spasm but little tangible comment is offered about the palpitations apart from generalisms that they could be result of me being stressed. Matters have culminated in me having a third Angiogram recently to explore the cause of my frequent extreme discomfort. Like many contributors if I dare to ask if the HH flare up could be triggering the palps I am told this is very unlikely. I have every respect for my cardiologist but he too resists any connection to a point where I feel I am out of court even mentioning a link. Imagine therefore how amazed I am to have found this thread and so many people with near identical stories and affected lifestyles. Been a challenge but I am being referred back to Gastroenterology where I am going to push for correctional surgery on the HH. Would really like to know is there anybody out there who has had this Op and if indeed the heart palps /discomfort improved/ceased? For those reading this my symptoms can include spells of severe body shakes(shivering) cold hands/feet, lump in the throat, and severe pain in sternum area radiating into right side of chest. I rarely feel things are triggered by foodstuffs but am sure certain movements can trigger an attack.e.g. Twisting my torso. I have been shy of doing much exercising worried may aggravate and therefore very interested in fact this has helped some. In an effort to self help I will try the exercises described. I do find eating smaller meals helps and whilst I did lose 16 kilos after initial surgery I am now determined to lose more. 5 ft 10in I am now 93 kgs and target getting to around 85.

Not seeing a doctor in hospital following the surgery to be informed how the surgery went surgery I naturally presumed the pain that followed was obviously normal3 weeks went by and the pain was not improving but getting worse. I visited my gp and was given tramadol for the pain. I developed a rash after the op inside my thighs, under my breasts and inside of elbows. The pain continued and I found it so unusual because it was in 3 locations around the scar, feel like it's pinching and I get stabbing pains when active. Touching the area lightly with my fingers causes pain even slightly rubbing below the scar area. Any form of movement is limited, sitting up and driving is impossible. The pain is debilitating I simply cannot do anything without being limited as to what I can do. I had requested an appointment with the consultant and he suggested an ultrasound. The result was there was nothing wrong with the scan which shocked me. This followed by seeing the consultant to discuss the scan and he couldn't find anything wrong and when he examined me the examination was not even in the area where the pain was. Another doctor however then examined me and said it was the sutures and nerve damage however the consultant quickly dismissed this. After much discussion he reluctantly agreed to reoperate and remove the mesh which I'm due to have in 4 weeks. I feel very disappointed with his attitude and it made me feel as if I was making the whole thing up. I've not been at work because I would not be able to work through the pain and limiting movement.

On that same day, I also had just started getting PMS symptoms as well (breast tenderness, low grade fever). My belly also got a little bigger since that day. The pain from my belly button is like a mild burning. I also feel sharp pain as well at times. Pressing on it, hurts the most. So I went to see my OBgyne today and she felt on my belly button where the pain was and immediately said its NOT a hernia. She said she would be able to feel through it. She says the pain is from the stitches that she placed there after the surgery. But I just don't understand why the pain would suddenly start 4 weeks later? I asked my OBgyne and she stated that's it's a part of healing and stitches move around etc. Also, the pain does NOT get worse with coughing or straining. The pain has no effect on my abdominal muscles at all. It's mainly on the surface. So if I irritate that spot it would start hurting. There's also a small lump under the skins surface also (my doctor felt that lump today and didn't feel it was a hernia). But when I cough, the lump does not come out. The pain also comes and goes.

Its more than likely the hiatus hernia is the culprit for the pain; the alarming thing though is that on a couple of occassions, the pain has seemed to come on through exertion..This is kind of awkward, but I was actually having sex...The pain does not occur when I cycle hard...puzzling to say the least....Has anyone had bouts of oesophageal pain through exerting themselves?I'm 28 and I don't smoke and I exercise regularly and am active. I was referred to cardiology a few years ago and they found nothing indicative of heart problems/disease. "

I am a 24 year old woman and About 7 months ago I started suffering from chronic back,chest and neck pain and also palpitations and short of breath went to the doctor and they put me on nexium.. The symptoms would happen after I ate so eventually got referred to a gastro specialist who did an endoscopy and found a small Hiatial hernia causing acid reflux in my oesophagus. He told me to keep taking nexium and slowly Come off it when symptoms were better. Well it never worked I had to quit my job the pain was really bad. I ended up going to a holistic centre and getting some therapy which seemed to help or so I thought.. The pain disappeared but I started noticing a lot of mucus build up sometimes after eating but didn't realise it was acid reflux. I came off the nexium and started eating whatever I wanted again (I still eat pretty healthy no soft drinks or anything) I am not overweight. Fast forward about 6 weeks not being on nexium and I woke up one morning and mid morning felt like I was going to pass out very faint very dizzy, blocked ear right side facial pain it got a little better but have been constantly lightheaded woozy and ear blocked for 12 weeks now. Seen an ent who going reflux and gp is pretty sure it's reflux that's caused this. Took a while to discover.. Off to see another gastro specialist soon. I tried going on an alkaline diet and became very weak and off balance due to not eating enough I am avoiding all main triggers no full fat dairy and no gluten only fish bed is now risen I have gavisconso please don't mention this. Has anyone had this problem? Anyone had surgery? As gp says I might have to do this as no matter what I eat I still get mucus after eating and or all the time and 12 weeks I'm still not well at all!! Also I am on pantoprazole now 20mg for 9 weeks just upped to 40mg for 1 week now"

"hernia","Advice on pain related to hiatus hernia","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/advice-on-pain-related-to-hiatus-hernia-496588","Hello everyoneWas producing a fair amount of acid and it felt like I had something stuck in my throat, so I had a camera down my throat, had a HH. Give me antiacids and told me to go, this generally helped for a fairly long time.But in the past year or so, while the acid symptoms have gotten better and I know what triggers the acid, it usually isn't too bad and I can generally eat within reason or drink alcohol even if both make me feel a little bloated.My problem is the constant pain that has nothing to do with the acid, if I eat too much or if after eating I lie down or shift at the wrong time then I'm in for a few hours of crippling pain, sometimes to the point where I can barely speak. It feels like someone has taken a sword and put it through my sternum, pain in the back, pain in the chest. I do get minor relief from vomiting, but the pain just becomes a bit more dull. If I vomit, then I'm usually done for a few days as my stomach and any hiccups end up giving me a great deal of pain.It's getting progressively worse, it used to happen every month - which I could deal with - then every two weeks - which I could deal with. Now it's happening frequently weekly, sometimes two or three times in a row at night. There appears to be no trigger other than the amount of food I eat, but even small amounts can trigger it. I've read about the stomach pushing on the vagus nerve, my personality can completely change during periods of pain. I also have developed anxiety issues from wondering when the next attack is going to come and I feel depressed, down about my condition affecting my future prospects.I'm currently living in Australia, looking to travel around in a few months and I wanted to work for the last few months. Things finally went well on the job front, but now I'm just thinking about going back to the UK because of this.Does anyone have any advice? PPIs have been ineffective at stopping the pain, and have had minimal efect on acid which hasn't really proven a great problem for me. "

Lots of confusion.","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/seeking-advice-on-abdominal-pain-and-hiatus-hernia-lots-of-confusion--494466","Firstly, thank you for reading this and providing any advice. Apologies for the long post, but I wanted to provide as much information as possible.I have, for the last 8 months experienced bouts of intense abdominal pain. Such to the degree that I have needed to lay on the bed/floor due to fear of fainting/passing out and nausea. The pain appears in the lower abdomen along with bloating and lasts typically 30 minutes or so, before it eases and continues as a minor belly ache. During investigations with various doctors, I have had;* numerous blood tests. All clear.* blood test for celiac desease. All clear.* hpylori breath test. All clear.* I was told I had gastritis and prescribed omeprazole, which helped but didn't stop the pain from accoring.* I was told I had GERD and precribed Lansoprazole, which again didn't stop the random pain, but also made me feel horrible. Especially headaches.* I was sent for an abdominal ultrasound which confirmed I had kidney stones in both kidneys. I have since had an abdominal CT scan at a urology dept who have said I don't have kidney stones, and the CT scan I saw, didn't (in my inexperienced opinion) show up anything. Some doctors believe this is an incidental finding, rather than related.* In addition, I had a gastroscopy which confirmed I have a 3cm sliding hiatus hernia.I do suffer from minor acid reflux, beltching and flatchulence but nothing too significant. The abdominal pain typically occurs in the early hours of the morning, well after I have eaten or druck anything. I liken it to a chemical reaction. I can turn over on to my side and all of a sudden my stomach is churning and the pain begins to build. My current doctor insists on continuing down the ""kidney stone"" route until he gets a formal report from the urologist, but I have also convinced him to refer me to a gastroenterologist.My question (after such a long post) is; Do you feel my symptoms are related to my Hiatus Hernia / GERD / Reflux in your opinion or experience?I eat a fairly good diet, but am currently cleaning it up even more. I don't tend to drink fizzy drinks or too much alcohol (honest) but happy to try most self-help things as I am not a fan of medication as they typically make me feel worse.Any thoughts, advice is very very much appreciated.

My hernia was repaired 2-weeks ago via key hole surgery. The surgeon described it as a ' large abdominal defect'. I stayed in hospital overnight and went home the next day. In hospital, I only experienced pain in moving but after a bumpy, hour long journey home I found I was in pain constantly - something which has continued. In addition to the pain I also experienced severe constipation and very bad pain in coughing and sneezing.We went away to a hotel for Christmas Day and I really struggled when it came to sitting at the table. Driving home we got caught up in traffic and the journey took over 3 hours, by which time I was not feeling at all well. I got very little sleep overnight and today I'm more swollen than a week ago and nothing is getting rid of the pain. I had a sneezing fit this afternoon and while holding my side I noticed a lump where my hernia had been. I paid down and the lump went. My husband placed his hand on my abdomen and asked me to cough - he said he could feel a lump 'appear' when I coughed.I'm really worried that I've damaged the repair. I have been very careful but I'm starting to panic that the constipation and travelling has not done me any favours. "

I've got an appointment in a couple of weeks to chat with my GP about the results and discuss diet and meds as this wasn't even mentioned at hospital!It's been very helpful reading your posts on here as I was still a little unconvinced that was the cause of my problems. Most people seem to have acid reflux and I don't have any, which is why an endoscopy wasn't my GP's first investigation, but I do have a burning sensation around my rib area and up my spine ( I was convinced I had gall stones but scans didn't reveal anything). I also seem to be opening my bowels 2 or 3 times a day sometimes and have a lot of wind so wonder if there's an element of food intolerance too. I do know that a couple of mornings when I wake up feeling/ being sick (nearly always starts in the morning) I've usually had something cream/ cheese based the day before. I can no longer drink alcohol as that makes me sick. I think possibly high fat food such as pate, duck and some pastries have an affect too. Will be so glad to get to GP and see what he has to say."

I don't think people really know how hard it is to deal with the symptoms when getting strong. I have had minor effects for probably 20 years, but it really started 5 or 6 years ago and the effects are getting steadily worse.I fortunately don't get to choking or gagging, but I have strong acid taste in mornings, even sleeping at 15% gradient in bed (which is the only effective gradient now)! 40mg esomeprazole doesn't seem to make things much better. I get increasing strong chest pains and pain in back between shoulders. It is debilitating and saps my strength. I now can not touch acid food without nasty consequences. I don't touch alcohol (almost never), I'm on a very strict diet to keep symptoms manageable. Its hard to sleep, travel and live any kind of sociable life with friends, and I'm just talking about staying over in a bed I can sleep in, or eating food they prepare. Holidays mean I have to find places with loads of pillows and then I cant eat most of the food anyway. Colds etc cause complications that seem to stay down in the chest and are hard to go. I had a virus that lasted 2 years and its pretty certain that my condition worsened the virus effects and now I have tinnitus and sometimes a numbness in the sinuses and head and aching eyes that seem to be connected to the level of acid reflux. It looks as if all of us sufferers seem to have a different mix of effects from our condition.I'm seeing a leading gastroenterological specialist (Prof Annette Fritscher-Ravens, don't know if any of you know her based in in London) this week and the big question is should I still live with this level of suffering or take the risk of the Fundoplication operation? Personally I have had nasty events where recently I thought, that's it, you must push for an alternative solution (an operation). It seems hard to tell from all your feedback what is the right decision.

Not alot of discomfort, just a mild burning sensation once in a while. I would say its small-medium right nowI plan to see the doctor and get a surgery in 2 months time.1) is it safe to do purely machine exercises in the mean time? ie.. seated chest press, seated dips, seated rows, seated machine preacher curls?2) whats the proper breathing method to NOT increase intra abdominal pressure? I know the Valsalva Maneuver is a no-go obviously, but what about stomach vacuums WHILE still breathing normally through the nose and lungsDoes blowing out your stomach while holding your breath increase intra abdomical pressure? Or does sucking in your abdomen increase the pressure??3) Now in 2015, is the laprosopic TEP mesh method gold standard for least recurrence, chronic pain and post op complications?

As I have a mesh inside me now that is not doing any good, I wondered if that could make the inguinal hernia worse. Remember that I just arrived in Central China and though I'm confident there are hospitals near me where I can get CT scan and the rest of it done, I still don't know the lay of the land or speak enough Chinese to make any sense of it yet.By the way China has a terrible reputation regarding medicine but honestly I have just not found that to be the case. In my experiences everything has been clean and professional here. Some hospitals are horribly overcrowded though.Anyway, I notice that during this 'relapse' the right side of my scrotum (where the viscera has descended) feels tighter and more uncomfortable while sitting than it did before. And it feel like some of the skin gets pressed between my thigh and the seat. The scrotum is normal to look at (sorry ladies, I know that sounds gross but it's very important) For a while I was freaking out that it was obstructed or something, but now I think that probably the mesh is putting extra pressure on it.I called the surgeon who did the operation (we call this a repair but it IS surgery) and he said that I could watch and wait and leaving the patch in would cause no problems. He said I could wait a year or even more if it didn't bother me, but advised that it would be best to repair it again. He said that the likelihood of complications like strangulation is not higher in a failed procedure, but if I did have such complications I would have to have emergency surgery anyway no matter where I was at. I think strangulation occurrence is rare enough that living with the hernia may be better than getting opened up to remove it. I know one thing: if I do remove this mesh I'll find a good needleworker and suture the hernia rather than redoing the mesh, as the failure rates are comparable. If the sutures fail, I'll then just try to live with the hernia from here on out. Plus, there are a lot of complications and concerns with surgery so as to make me want to shy away from it at this point. If all there doing is eliminating the risk of strangulation but the tradeoff being even more risks in return, I might just risk emergency surgery in the case of strangulation. Everyone knows that in the case of strangulation you'll be howling in agony and will get to the hospital on way or another.Now I'm doing yoga for my hernia and that is opening a whole new world for me. I'm actually enjoying getting old, lol."

I was in a severe motorcycle accident 2 years ago, broke all ribs on my left side, punctured a lung and I had internal bleeding for which they cut me from my breast bone to my public bone to find the problem which resulted in removing my spleen. As a result of the abdominal surgery I have a large incisional hernia. After the accident I was on a ventilator for a few days and i have since remained on supplemental oxygen, 3 liters. I also see pain management because I was also diagnosed with fibromialgia as the result of a trauma. My lower spine has shifted and twisted throwing me out of alignment. So with all that I have going on, I have a considerable amount of pain. I have a hard time differentiating what the hernia symptoms are and what is just body pain. My stomach usually feels pretty good when I first wake up, but with any food I eat, it will get bloated and very uncomfortable. Sometimes it feels like someone has their hands around my stomach and is literally trying to pull it out. Other times when I walk it's almost like to stand up straight I can feel it pulling and it's so much more comfortable to stoop forward. The doctors told me they can't operate because of my oxygen, that I would end up on a ventilator indefinitately so right now surgery isn't an option. So my question is what types of symptoms have others experienced with an incisional hernia? Mine is just below my breastbone. Is there anything that can relieve the pain of the muscles pulling? Would muscle relaxers work? Any input anyone could offer would be appreciated, thanks! Erika"

At the start of the year I was noticing when I walked the dog I was getting pain in my throat, I thought this was due to the cold air. It gradually got worse until I had that indigestion feeling of a golf ball moving up and down my oesophagus, with a burning sensation, feeling that I needed to burp and forcing one up! It wasn't happening immediatley, usually after a half mile or so.The main symptoms I have are the indigestion/pain in throat feeling when walking fast (chewing gum helps), also when cutting the grass and sweeping up (bizarrely only when I pull the brush towards me not away from me!). Lifting heavy shopping sometimes results in pain. Tried some running today and that hurt too. I also get the other symptoms, breastbone pain (painful to touch), sore throat, sometimes a click feeling when I swallow, a bit wheezy sometimes when breathing (certainly more prone to bouts of heyfever). Fortunately I have only woken up twice with acid in my throat, once after too much red wine and the other after eating a Chinese too late at night, my own fault that!I have to say that the symptoms did get worse after the endescopy though. 10 days beforehand I had to stop taking Omeprazole, I had already adjusted my diet and could now walk better without too much discomfort.Does anyone else get similar symptoms when doing any form of exercise? Currently got a sore throat after the run/walk.Looking at options for the future, don't fancy the Nissan procedure, but the linx one looks promising.Cheers,Mike "

After very many years of having a hernia in my naval, likely from lifting heavy items at work, it eventually became strangulated/infected and I had to have surgery for it. I was kept overnight on IV antibiotics before surgery when they decided to try to get the infection under control first. The next morning the Infection wasn't any better so the doctor decided to perform the surgery without a mesh (because the mesh would have become infected).That was almost 5 years ago. Fast forward about 1.5 to 2 years after the surgery and I started noticing I could feel food in my upper chest area a bit at times. In the past year I had gotten so that I noticed it more and more. Apparently it has slowly progressed when 2 months ago I was trying to eat carefully and suddenly I couldn't couldn't swallow and couldn't hardly breathe and I went to the sink and was gasping for air and trying to drink water some to flush it out. The water I was swallowing to try to flush the food down or out was coming back up through my mouth and even my nose. But it was bringing pieces of food with each time and after a scary minute or so of this I managed to get air and slowly the food that was caught in my chest when on down. I thought I had gotten too careless eating. However, a couple of weeks after that it happened again. Then the other day it happened again but at least I could breathe this last time, my airway wasn't quite as constricted. I can feel some pressure in my chest when I eat. I've begun losing weight to see if that will help. It seems I also develop gas more often when eating now, so I've started taking a rolaid before eating and gas x after eating. It sounds like I have a hiatal hernia that has worsened. I'm wondering if this is a result of the stomach surgey i had.to have. Like I said, this first occurred about 2 years after my surgery and has slowly worsened. I'm trying some exercises I found on the internet about pushing the stomach down to help with hiatal hernias. I'm reluctant to go to the doctor about this and want to try to self helping myself first to see if losing weight (I'm probably about 20 pounds overweight) and dong the stomach push down exercise wlll make a difference. Can a naval stomach surgery possibly create a hiatal hernia?Does the lack of a mesh increase the chance?Does losing weight tend to really help a hiatal hernia.I wonder if I have the sliding kind or the more dangerous rolling kind?I see folks here talking about having heartburn and acid reflux but rarely say anything about choking. I rarely get heartburn or reflux. Is this a sign I have a very big hernia or a rolling hernia? Sorry for so many questions. "

They brought everything down and inserted a titanium plate in my diaphragm to bridge the gap. Following that, I went into intensive care, where, a few days later, a scan revealed that the plate had come away and my internals had gone back into my chest, so I had to go through the procedure again, followed by being returned to intensive care on life support and ‘wired for sound’.Unfortunately a few weeks later, a further scan revealed what they thought was waste on my lung from a perforated bowel so I had to go for further major surgery to take my left lung out through my back, clean it up and put it back.In total I spent 56 days in intensive care, 30 of which I was in a coma, and been out of hospital for 8 months and trying to get back to some normality. I look a bit like a chess board now from all the scares but more importantly I’m alive and back to work.I’ll probably never be fully fit again and I’m very tight inside with a large belly on me that I’ve never had, but I’m still here, my wife has her moaning husband back and my children have their nagging dad back.I don’t want my experiences to put anyone off having this surgery as my condition was far more extreme than most people; I’m more than happy to help offer advice on surgery and recovery, and indeed what to expect post operation. “Good Luck”"

While I was there I got her to check a lump I'd found in my tummy located just above my navel. the lump is about the size of a marble but not really hard, but sort of squidgy. Dr said it was a small Hernia. I didn't ask too many questions as I was really there for something else and you know how it is, not much time. She said it wasn't big enough to do anything about. since then, I've been reading all sorts of stories about hernias on the internet, how they can get strangulated and having to be rushed into hospital for emergency surgery. I'm not even sure what type of Hernia this is, and I'm so worried now. Will this go worse and will I have to be operated on? I'm terrified. I'm an anxious person at the best of times and this has just added to my problems. I have IBS too and I'm worried this will have an affect on the Hernia. I am a very mobile person, do a lot of walking and gardening and over the years, a lot of heavy work renovating properties. I'm 57. Will I be able to continue walking and gardening and doing things I love? Any info will be gratefully received. "

Its a bit like the noise you make before your about to be sick. Lately my stomach is constantly burning and I feel sick. It lasts all day! I'm starting to feel really fed up of the whole thing. I try to avoid acid foods but nothing is helping and I haven't really found much on the net about meal ideas. Can anyone recommend meal ideas (I'm a very plain eater which doesn't give me much choice!) and soft drinks that Dont aggravate my hernia? Also is there anyone that has had the same symptoms and how did you geton with pregnancy? I'm hoping to plan for a baby next year.

It varies in intensity, and on occasions it's been quite worrying. The doctor said that things either get better or worse, so see if it goes away; alas it did not.Recently, I've started experiencing a much larger pressure from time to time, below the sternum and above the belly-button. This seems practically random, and the pressure can be staggering - to the point where the pressure feels like it's coming up my chest and around my face. Again, no 'pain' or sharpness, just massive pressure. This part is less frequent that the constant chest pressure, but it can last some hours. Eating something sometimes seems to alleviate the pressure.Exercise does not make the condition worse, and while I have no issue with my breathing, it feels like I do due to the chest pressure.My doctor doesn't think it's a Hiatal Hernia, but he's given me some GORD tablets to take once a day for a month. It's only been four days, but it's not really making a difference - I'll obviously continue for remainder of the month and come back to him.I'm nearly 34, so a little outside the regular age bracket for this; can anyone who's experienced such say whether the symptoms seem consistent or contrary?"

The same doctor examined my stomach and said he couldn't feel a hernia. I have had an ultrasound scan for gallstones, and all blood tests I had came back normal.

"hernia","Ongoing Groin Strain or Herina or ???","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/ongoing-groin-strain-or-herina-or--301246","Hello, please can someone help because this is driving me insane!I’m a 34-year-old male and slightly overweight with maybe not the best diet in the world.For quite a while now (18 months or so) I’ve been having a sensation that there is some kind of 'lump' on my lower right abdomen, it isn’t painful at all, but I’m regularly aware its there. It seems much more noticeable if I wear a belt and am sitting down, I assume the pressure of the belt on my stomach makes it more obvious or something. Same thing if I squat down or sit on the sofa with my legs up so my belly is under a little pressure.Its also quite uncomfortable when I press the spot where the 'lump sensation is' i.e if my daughters are climbing over me etc.About 18 months ago while playing sport I had what I thought was a groin strain, I could carry on playing but it was pretty uncomfortable! I've been getting pain from this on and off since, I would have thought a normal groin strain would have cleared itself up by now as I’ve not really been doing anything active since. Please excuse the slight graphic nature of the next bit!! With regards to toilet habits, I’ve generally always been on the looser side, however when they are more solid they seem a bit squashed – I think this is ribbon stools? I went to the doctors who’s only answer for everything seems to be the fact I’m overweight and seems disinterested in listening to any other symptoms. He had a little prod around of my abdomen but didn’t find any lumps. I said to him at the time as he prodded I could almost feel the ‘lump’ sensation move as he applied pressure. He also did do a ‘back passage’ inspection and said it was fine. So yea, I just got sent away with him saying ‘ I just think that’s the way you are, lose weight and I’m sure it will be ok’. Well that’s fine, but it wasn’t like it in the past – so how can it be ‘the way I am’??? I’m SURE there is something there, and reading the web etc, I think its quite possible it’s a hernia but feel pretty frustrated he wont send me for a scan or whatever?Anyone got any ideas?

"hernia","Recurrent Hernia or not?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/recurrent-hernia-or-not--312494","Hi, 13 years ago I suffered an inguinal hernia on my right side which was repaired via open surgery & a mesh. After the surgery everything was fine with no pain or further discomfort.However over the past week I started getting some similar symptoms with discomfort & aching in the area where the previous hernia was which was also occasionally showing up in my thigh (All felt the same as when I had the hernia in 2001).I went to my local medical centre yesterday & was examined by my doctos who said he could not feel anything which felt like a hernia. During the examination he put pressure on the area both sides of my groin & asked me to cough & also checked my testicles again asking me to cough (Both while standing & lying down).Having done all that he said he could not feel an obvious hernia & refered me for an ultrasound which i'm currently waiting for.However since yesterday i've developed further discomfort but this time with my right testicle. Its not a pain as such but more a general ache/discomfort. Nothing seems to be swolen & there doesn't seem to be anything obvious having done a more thorough check myself.The left side is fine, Its just the right which does also seem slightly sensitive to touch.I didn't have this symptom when I had the hernia last time so this along with the doctos yesterday saying he could not feel anything (Back in 2001 my old doctos did the same check & said he could detect the hernia) is throwing me a bit as until now all of the symptoms had been the same as they were when I had the hernia in 2001 (Although slightly more uncomfortable).I know that the hernia can receed into the testicles & cause some discomfort but surely if this was the case the doctor would have noticed?Right now its not really major, Just a pretty uncomfortable annoyance.Basically I'd just like to know if there is perhaps anything else it could be & if there are perhaps further checks I should be asking for depending on what the ultrasound shows?"

I was half expecting him to try and put me off the operation but I was very surprised! He basically gave me my choices of continuing for the rest of my life on the medication or have it repaired. He drew me a diagram of what happens during the op so was quite helpful. He explained it would either be keyhole surgery or an incision but they would not be able to tell until I'm on the table so to speak on whether they would be able to do the keyhole surgery. I asked what the statistics were on it being successful and he said 90% in the first ten years do not have a return of symptoms. He explained that I will probably not be able to eat as normal for several months and that's I'm likely to have trouble swallowing initially but I should return to normal within weeks. He did mention with the hiatus hernia op I will never be able to be sick again. Which is slightly worrying but it apparently will come out the other end! So now I'm just waiting for a date, he said probably not this side of Xmas which to me is good as I can enjoy all that yummy Xmas food before my not so yummy liquid diet after the op! "
"hernia","Inguinal Hernia or not?","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/inguinal-hernia-or-not--300095","Hi, first I apologise if this is long! But I'll be as brief as possible. I am 50 female, slightly overweight, always been active - gym 2-3 times week. About 10 months ago, had suspected appendicitis, severe lower right abdo pain. Went to hospital but didnt stay as 5hr wait. Went home, suddenly felt about 50% better, but next day had some bleeding from bowel so I know something was up. Since then, seen several specialists - all scans clear except for ovarian cyst, which was removed, & at same time found big area of adhesions around cecum & appendix, which were separated, but no cause for them identified. This was in April. Things improved a bit, but still have severe pain in lower right abdo, occasional constipation/bowel obstruction, the main pain seems near my hip in my groin. Ultrasounds have detected 'severe pain in inguinal canal' but unable to demonstrate a hernia. I have not done any sports to aggravate anything, so I don't think groin pull - and in 10 months it hasn't gone better. I've had my hip checked by a specialist, not that! But altered gait/slight limp is now causing inflammation in greater trochanter muscle. I am walking along & if I push my fist into my hip area/groin, it helps a bit. Last week I was sitting on the sofa & bent forward to pick something up off the floor, had a massive pop/burst immediate pain in lower right abdo/groin/hip area, followed by severe pain for about an hr after (my husband nearly called an ambulance!) & then my groin/hip area actually felt a bit better for a couple of days. Since it has got worse again. I made a mental note that it was a burst or sharp sudden pop rather than a tear. Have had several scans - US/mri/ct, even colonoscopy/barium swallow - nothing shows up. I was admitted to hospital 2 weeks ago with severe pain but discharged myself after the lady next to me died (traumatic day!) Have seen a spine specialist (have a slight pars defect), he is doing nerve block on spine next week but I don't think this is the main cause of my pain. Specialist I have seen wants to just treat me for pain with nerve blocks, but I think I need to know what the problem is. My BP has been too high since Jan usually 150/100 at least (I have never suffered with high BP, mine is normally low). Surgeons are reluctant to operate/look for an inguinal hernia because they can't feel a lump! My GP thinks problem with inguinal canal. On max painkillers 8 paracetamol (also mix with co-codamol to max allowed), plus 3 x diclofenac or 1200mg of ibuprofen daily, dulls the pain, but doesn't make it go! Totally at the end of my tether not able to walk more than 20 feet without pain, can't sit for long, pick anything up, bend over, can't concentrate to work - this year has been a blur actually. Any advice or thoughts please? "

Secondly I should say I live in Thailand in an area of questionable medical praticises, so self diagnosing is the norm (internet) and medications even normally prescription are freely available. My condition and issues are as follows:- - three moths ago after a night of drinking beer, the next day I started getting a burning chest pain which lasted 3/4 hours. I suspected pancreatitus which I have had before. I drastically cut back drinking but the pains continued. For about two years I occasionally had chest/stomach pains some 24 hours after drinking beer. -I stopped drinking alcohol some 6 weeks ago but still have chest pain usually at night and heartburn throughout the day. The heartburn type pain sometimes only occurs with movement, mowing the lawn for example brings this on. The pain eases when I rest and if I am aware I can go all day with no pain or heartburn. Antacids or Gaviscon do not help. Sounds a bit like angina? -I have been waking up for several years now with a bitter/sour taste in mouth and regularly took antacids. Now I have a strong acidic/bitter taste in morning and if I get up and make the bed, this can bring on the burnung pain. - I am 72 so probably have a hiatal hernia and associated problems. - I had my gallbladder removed 20 plus years ago, so would be susceptable to bile reflux. - I went to a hospital 6 weeks ago, no tests but was prescribed sucraflate, omeprazole and mosepride citrate anhydrous. After 6 weeks treatment the problems got no better perhaps worse. After reading up on acid versus bile reflux thes medications can exacerbate the latter condition. I stopped omeprazole a few days ago. I am reluctant to have an endoscopy, last time in UK the sedative did not work and here they do not sedate. - working on the basis of bile relux I have ordered cholestramine, sulflate, and mosepride and will give this one month. Otherwise I will have to return to UK for tests and treatment.. I have recently included in my diet bile absorbing foods, I rarely eat foods to avoid with bile problems and overworking the pancreas. Any comments would be appreciated, especially from anyone with similar symptoms. With such health problems we worry about the big C, all I can say on this is I have no blood coming from anywhere and do not have difficulty swallowing. "

It was diagnosed as gilmore's groin and it has been managed by physiotherapy and I've been able to resume all my sporting activities, which are mainly cycling and swimming. After twinging the injury again last December, I went to my doctor and insisted I have a soft tissue scan to see if there was a hernia, which confirmed I did have one. Wanting it repaired, I was referred to the Royal Free, but the quality of care there has been appaling. They are totally reluctant to perform the operation and keep trying to dissuade me from going ahead. I saw the consultant himself and after examining me he said I didn't have a hernia, but a gilmore's groin. His manner was curt and I found him unprofessional. He said a gilmore's groin repair would only have a 50% chance of success. Though I feel I've managed the injury fairly well through core strengthening exercies, pilates and yoga, it still isn't 100% and I'm frustrated that I'm encountering such a wall of disconcern and deliberate delays.

I had a bowel abscess, undiagnosed, ending up with a colostomy for a year (from Jan 13) and then a reversal of the stoma and restructuring of bowel (bit cut out) in Jan this year. the hernia does not hurt as such but the skin burns and tingles. I was told by my GP that i should ignore it as it is v. difficult to repair and a major op but as this is the same GP who missed my abscess for 4 months (telling me I had IBS until I went down to 6 stone and my bloods were all over the place) I am not sure I trust him. Any advice very much welcomed. I am an active working 55 year old slim/thin woman. Thanks Ann"

It all started when i had a wound which inflated, so i started taking ibuprofen. That is when i started feeling pains in the stomach. So my mom took me to the hospital and i was diagnosed with gastritis. The doc putted me on cimetidine and restricted my diet.I followed the treat for around some months then i had a relief and started eating back anything i wanted.One time I had malaria fever, i took coatem. That is when the gastritis started nack again. So i started back cimetidine and maalox, then i chilled out but this time not completely. Since that time i had been coping like that until in february 2014 where i had a stomach attack. The food i had eaten hours ago had not digested, i had shortness of breath, it was just like i will pass out. so i went to the hospital and the doc gave me omeprazole which helped a little. So it just restored me back to my state before the attack.After that i had to do an endoscopy(fibroscopy), after which the doc said the cardial sphinter was dilated so food was going up and down, instead of down only. So i continued omeprazole but nothing seems to be changing.Right now the symptoms that i have are: shortness of breath when i lean forward or when i am in a bad position, stomach pains after a meal which to a normal person will not b called a heavy meal, left arm pains sometimes, right rib pains sometimes, lump in the throat either when i am hungry or after a meal most atimes, neck pain sometimes, and each time my stomach pains and i had difficulties breathing i feel tired and want to sleep even if i am just from sleeping, and i also have pain in the chest and slight headachetimes. The worse of the chest pain is if a do sports, it will pain me for some time then stop.Sometimes i think i am going crazy with all the things that goes through my head when those pains begin. Sometimes i feel fine when i have not eaten anything and immidiately i take in something it starts.So right now i dont know what it is. Because i have read other people's post and it seems like a have abit of all of their symptoms.i don't know if anybody have had what i am having and how is he/she coping with it or have cured it, because seriously it makes my life miserable.thanks."

I am a 33-year-old male with general good health who has been having a number of symptoms for the past two months, and wondered whether they are due to an inguinal hernia:1) Changed bowel habits - from it being easy to go three times a day to going once/twice a day and it being slow/difficult to go;2) Nausea and bloating after eating and when I have a full bladder/bowel. It wakes me in the night and when I go I feel better but still uncomfortable in bed;3) Pressure/heavy feeling in my lower abdomen which is worse when I sit or put pressure on my belt line. After sitting for longer periods it leaves me feeling tender and with redness in the area;4) Pressure in my perineum which gets worse when I sit for long periods and gives me a pain in my coccyx from time to time;5) A dull pain in my scrotum which runs up into my groin and makes urination difficult when I am standing. Sitting on the toilet is far easier and I get relief from lying on a hard floor - usually on my back with my legs bent.Could it be I have an inguinal hernia?Any thoughts would be very much appreciated."

My conclusions so far regarding ways to improve the quality of life are: stay away from trigger foods - for me this means: dairy products, spicy food, tomato sauce, caffeine, alcohol, most sweets, chocolate, eat small meals, exercise mildly (and see what works for you and what not), never sleep when full, raise your bed, share your problem with others and try to maintain a positive attitude towards life (I know its hard, I am living with the thing!), keep yourself occupied by reading books, listening to music, doing things that please you. I take prilosec 20mg daily and gaviscon or maalox tablets when I get heart burn. I up my dose of prilosec to 40mg daily when in crisis. But this normally occurs when eating things I shouldn't. I have had outbursts when I had to up even more my dossage but also had quiet periods when I skipped prilosec for a day or two. I always search for ways to get rid of the pills but I think that either surgery or a monastic way of living could probably achieve it. Physicians and doctors have told me that I won't be able to shake them off. All in all I have come to this: our way of life, even the place we live in (pollution) makes it very hard to adjust to a healthier diet. So we just have to try and stay away from trigger foods for the most part of our lives. And the most difficult part is when you actually begin to feel better and decide to add some of these foods in your diet. "

I have not been well for a long time now, and in the last year and half i have felt things have become worse. I was told at the start they thought i had IBS, then a viral infection. Then they gave me tablets for excess acid. I had increase pain and tightness in chest area, sickness and nausea. I found it hard to sleep at night and things seem to be getting worse. I keep going to doctor and things didn't seem to be getting better or any easier. In June i had the endoscopy (Camera)down throat, which wasnt a very pleasent experience but pleased i did it. They diagnosed me with a Hiatus Hernia, and i came home. I was told to carry on with tablets which was increased from one morning and night, instead of one a day. I also had a stronger dose of sickness tablets. Which didn't seem to make a difference. I went back to doctor and explain things werent any better and it was really effecting me at work. I was having to come home as i was in pain at work and sick and very tired with not been able to sleep at night. This was stressing me out!! On 21st Nov i went into hospital to have a tube down to check the acid Levels which the tube was down for 24hrs and also to check my muscle around me hernia, as they now believe i might have GERD. The result showed that my muscles around my hernia were not working and that might be why i was getting so much pain.I have now been off work now for 4weeks as i am really struggling, and i am waiting results. I have been to see my GP, he believe an operation is the way forward as the tablets are now working and he can see i am getting stressed by this. So now i am just waiting for result and for hospital to get back in touch.Not only does this condition hurt on the inside but also mentally as i feel very restricted in what i can do. I cant exercise as moving around makes me sick. I dont drink or really socialise as the smokey rooms effect me and i never know how i feel from day to day.I am only hoping something can be done soon. From those people i have spoken to they have said that after having the operation they have never looked back!It is very frustration, as you feel very helpless and i know i can be very negative at time and take things out on people close. I am very depressed now, but i know things will get better, but just when that the question i want to know.From all the thing i have ever read about, it say you can get this from being over weight, smoke, stressed. I believe i may have been a little stressed, as my occupation i actually am very physical, or so i used to be till i was ill cause i am a Beauty and Holistic therapist, so i do alot of massage.My friend who also does the same job has become ill and she is slowly getting seen by the hospital.Please if anyone wants to know anything please dont hesitate to ask.Many thanks for reading my long message and i wish everyone best of luck in getting health sorted.Sarah[i:2340c02106]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:2340c02106]"

I was one of the lucky ones and had to have an endoscopy, but after having said endoscopy I knew I had an Hiatus Hernia. I have now been taking 40mg esomeprazole (Nexiam) for around 10yrs now and have minimal problems. Around 3yrs ago I had to have my gall bladder removed after suffering frequent incredible pain caused by the pressure of bile being blocked by gall stones, this pain would last until the gall stone had been passed through the bile duct. Any pain around the area of your hiatus hernia will be mainly felt behind the sternum, which was why the specialist I went to see about this horrific pain decided (after various tests failed to return any conclusive evidence) to remove my gall bladder.Every day is different, sometimes feel on top of the world which believe me is not often, to feeling nauseus, chest pains, and countless other symptoms. I have also been taking for about a year now Candesartin for my blood pressure but find regular bike riding helps to keep things in check.More recently because I work sitting at a bench welding small components I find it is hard to concentrate on my posture, which causes a lot of pain associated with the position of sitting (lots of typists an office workers suffer terrible pain between their shoulders and neck due to sitting at a desk for long periods). Sitting for long periods of time also causes you to slouch which in turn puts pressure on the hiatus hernia. I have because of this, recently been suffering sudden bouts of spasms around my hernia, which seems to temporarily tighten my chest accompanied with sudden pain, the sensation of being on the verge of passing out, and affects my breathing. This is frightening to say the least, the first time it happened I thought this is it, brown bread, the long sleep.I am toying with the idea now of having the operation but I'll see how things go for a while longer, anyway this is how I feel living with my Hiatus Hernia.Just a parting note: No-one really understands what you are living with, only a fellow sufferer. I always tell anyone mocking me as malingerer, \""DON'T KNOCK IT TILL YOU'VE TRIED IT\"".

They also try to make you feel like its no big deal, but what i'm reading it is a big deal and can really affect your life, which it is doing with me. I do not really have acid reflux problems, but I read that the symptoms vary slightly from person to person. My symptoms started with burning in the stomach and pain on my right side. I now am experiencing belching, tightness, fullness, bloating, couching when laying on my back, pain laying on my right and trouble breathing on any side. From all the postings things don't seem like they are going to get any better and not much seems can be done by the doctors with very little support. On top of all this I have Hep C, Fibromyalgia, herniated disc, hypertension, and yes i'm overweight. I am so tired all the time that I haven't the energy for very little of anything. And to add this HH to my list of problems which sounds like it will only gets worst over time doesn't give me much to look forward to in the future.This sight really did help though, thank you for all the posting, it did shed some light on what I have been experiencing when the doctors gave little in the way of what was wrong with me. Because of my hep C and the pain was on the same side as my liver I just knew it was my liver but all the test they ran kept coming back neg this was so fustrating for me I kept saying to myself it's my liver I know it's my liver but now I see maybe it's not my liver."
"hernia","My Hiatus Hernia","https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-hiatus-hernia-12764","I was diagnosed having a very small hiatus hernia at the age of 25, I am now 49. I was prescribed mucaine and used it on and off for a period of time, it did work.Once I had no problems I ceased to use the mucaine.[u:db696c0f00][b:db696c0f00]Current Symptoms/Experiences.[/b:db696c0f00][/u:db696c0f00]When I eat I have to stop when I feel an 'attack' coming on. I just sit bolt upright and have this feeling of a 'blockage' and after a period of time, this can vary from 20 seconds to a few minutes, the sensation of something sliding down my gullet freeing itself occurs whereupon I can continue eating. This can continue on and off throughout the meal, I try and eat small portions to avoid these symptoms occuring.Sometimes to assist in freeing the 'blockage' I take a drink of water or fizzy liquid, this does help if I catch it athe right time, but if it doesn't then all hell breaks loose. The 'blockage' stays with this column of fluid above it with nowhere to go but out the way it came. I have to go for a walk and regurgitate what has just went into my gullet and after a while the 'blockage' clears itself and I can continue eating. Sometimes I have left the room for something like 30 minutes until I am 'off the hook'.I have read numerous pages of symptoms but none of them match 'my' hiatus hernia :shock:.RegardsIan Shylan"
