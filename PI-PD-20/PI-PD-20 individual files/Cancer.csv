"Cancer","Lump on my penis","I have attached the images above. So, basically I have noticed this lump on my penis yesterday in the morning. Its painless, but, I have anything like this for the first time. I haven't masturbated since a week and I am not sexually active guy. Can you tell me what is this?"
"Cancer","Is it a cancerous tumour?","Hi! I'm a 17 year-old female. I don't take any medications and I don't have any health conditions as far as I know. I've had this weird lump on the back of my head for more than 1.5 years now. To begin with it would bleed and leak pus, but for a long time it hasn't done either now. It's a firm lump that moves around under my skin and hurts when I press on it, but I don't notice it otherwise. I haven't noticed any other weird symptoms. I think the lump is about 1.5-2 cm in diameter.Is it something I should worry about? Could this be a cancerous tumour or something else that is dangerous? Should I see a doctor?"
"Cancer","Bleeding everyday","hi for a month now ive been bleeding from my vagina non stop some times its smallp amounts sometimes its a lot it all started when i was constipated and strained to go to the toilet but now its everyday please help"
"Cancer","Bump on skin for months "," ive had this bump on my shoulder for months now if i try to mess with it it starts bleeding i got bad anxiety im scared its skin cancer any opinions"
"Cancer","Skin cancer scare horrible health anxiety ","i have had this mole for years and years and years. nothing has ever changed.. always been the same size, color and weird shape. i have severe health anxiety and now im freaking out that i have melanoma! i have a tela -doctor appointment on monday for something else and ill show it to him but does anyone have moles like this? does it look normal? i know you guys are not doctors but its the weekend and i just need some kind of peace of mind. thanks 😃"
"Cancer","I don’t get hungry pains or ever feel hungry but I can eat food if it’s in front ","i was told i had ibs ive had colonoscopy 4 stool test ct scan and all normal but i just dont get the urge to eat food i have to get up and get food but body dosent tell me im 20 and male is it normal"
"Cancer","Does this sound like skin cancer??","There is this blotch or splotch thing on my inner thigh, about the size of a fingernail but with really faded borders, kind of how an irritated mosquito bite might look. The splotch changes colour depending on the lighting, but usually is between a shade of pink and red. When I look at it it sometimes looks brown but if I take a picture it comes out as a light pink colour.It changes colour and lightens a bit if I press on it, but it is a bit raised and feels different from the skin around it. When I pick at it, it looks really irritated and the skin around it turns blotchy and red. It almost feels hard, like something embedded in my skin, which is really weird and freaks me out a lot.I don`t remember exactly how long it has been here for...I would guess maybe a year or a bit shorter. Which makes me really scared that if it is something serious, it already got the chance to spread everywhere and is probably in my brain and lungs and bones and everything. I never got it checked out, even though I have had severe anxiety about it before, because my family told me not to worry about it, and that it looked normal. Since everyone knows I have really bad health anxiety (like a headache being brain cancer or an achy neck meaning I have meningitis and have to go the ER right away) they usually shrug off my concerns.Plus, since I gained weight I have a lot of stretch marks and veins and such stuff on my thighs so I thought for a while maybe it was related to that. But it definitely does not look the same., so I think I was wrong to think they were related.Does this sound like melanoma D: What freaks me out is I am pretty sure there was never a mole or anything there, and this does not exactly look like a mole, but for all I know there was a mole there and I just never thought about it or noticed it. I am spiralling in anxiety about it right now."
"Cancer","Cancer diagnosis and treatment ","My father was diagnosed with cancer 5 years ago, currently here is doing fine.I am not knowledgeable about it, but I often hear that cancer has the tendency to comeback, and I am looking to mitigate risk of that.Should I take him for x-rays to check? How often should one check?How much (on average) does diagnosis and treatment usually cost?Thank you"
"Cancer","I have a swollen lymph node for almost Five years","Hi there, i have 34 years old and i noticed a lump in my neck (jugulodigastric lymph node) five years ago with no other symptoms.It's a painless and movable one. Long axis is 1,5cm and short axis is less than 1cm.I also have a seborrheic dermatitis in scalp and face since i'm a child.My doc is not worried but i'm affraid about something severe. I'm very frustrated cause i don't have any answers and Dr Google scares me.Do you think i would have other symptoms if it were a lymphoma or something severe?Thank you for reading.Any advices would be appreciated."
"Cancer","Silent Reflux as a teenager ","I think I have silent reflux. I'm 17, I'm very paranoid it will become cancerous. I can relate to most of the symptoms - a bit of a sore throat, postal nasal drip (white mucus at the back of my throat) constant clearing, with a little cough. not a loud one though. I have red dots at the back of my throat, sometimes one dot may be a bit bloody. (I know this is cobblestone throat, which is completely harmless.) I suffer from extreme anxiety so I'm really scared. This has been happening for ages. 3 years? I always thought it was normal until I began googling my symptoms. I'm now scared to death, I'm trying to change my diet. - I'm no longer eating dairy. Certain food triggered my throat. Especially milk, noodles etc. I'm going to the doctors soon to explain my symptoms, hoping to get an answer. Any advice? I'm so anxious. I suffer from health anxiety. 😦 I'm just scared they'll just leave me hanging. I do not want to die 😦 It is my worse fear. I constantly think about it daily, it has made me depressed."
"Cancer","Lump near my anus, it feels somewhat soft. Pic is included ","I am a 25 year old man, I used to lift relatively heavy weight but with proper form. I noticed 9 days ago while I was cleaning my butt (after pooping) with soap that there's somewhat of a bump near my anus. It doesn't hurt or anything it's just a bump. I don't feel anything different, there is no blood, no itchiness whatsoever. It's just a lump,but I'm still worried because I don't know what it is. I stopped lifting for about 4 days now. Here it is. "
"Cancer","Lump on my penis what could it be? ","found this lump the other day looked like a spot or something so tried to pop it but nothing really came out at all so was wondering what it could be. see if i need to see a doctor or not. could it be a cyst or something more serious? "
"Cancer","How fast can Blood Cancers or Anemia develop?","Hi all,Long story short 8 weeks I got sick with a fever and a wet cough. Fever was gone after 3 days. Initially the wet cough had yellow/green phlegm, afterwards it became white phlegm for another 4 weeks or before it finally disappeared.During the past 8 weeks I haven't slept properly. Initially lots of sleepless nights and then sleep became very broken and interrupted. These days I wake up every 1-2 hours and would get 6-7 hours of interrupted sleep a night if I'm lucky.I have also been very fatigued with not much energy. From about 3-4 weeks ago I've started doing some light exercise, i.e. push-ups, sit-ups, easy cycling. I've also been doing some light jogging in the last 2 weeks.This Monday I did a CRP test which showed that the infection was gone. Doctor thinks it might have been the Coronavirus but there is no way to be certain.My anxiety has been extremely high. I can't stop worrying about my health. Normally I am a very energetic and active 32 year old and never been unwell for this long. I feel my breathing is not right, although lungs have been checked by the doctors twice. Nowadays I pay attention to my every breath, and I feel that I'm breathing deeper than normal. At night I sometimes wake up and feel like I'm breathing fast.My biggest concern is that the fatigue also has another underlying issue. Some symptoms seem to be consistent with anemia.So my question is how fast can anemia develop? Before I had the fever I felt fine and normal. 10 weeks ago (so 2 weeks before the fever) I did a pilot medical and my haemoglobin levels were normal, but I don't know the exact value.So can anemia develop so fast that it takes effect in a number of weeks? I'm paranoid that I have some sort of blood cancer....Many thanks"
"Cancer","Constant anxiety I might have cancer- scared about new symptoms","I'm having really bad anxiety and I'm sorry to write such a long post but I was hoping someone might be able to help give me some advice!Every day, there's some new symptom or some new thing that I noticed that sends me spiralling into a panic attack and imagining the worst case scenario. It's really hard to do almost anything during the day because I spend so much time focused on it and feeling a rollercoaster of anxiety D: And right now I can't go to the doctor because of all the COVID stuff, so I can't get anything checked out by a doctor and I'm worried by the time I can it'll be too late.I've noticed some lymph node swelling- mostly in my neck. About a week ago I felt swollen lymph nodes in my armpits and they hurt a tone, but it doesn't hurt anymore and I'm pretty sure(?) I can't feel the nodes anymore. If they're there then they're really small. In my neck they're under my jaw and around the side of my neck- it feels like there's this big lump on the left side. I tried to check if my collarbone had swollen lymph nodes but I prodded around there so much I ended up really hurting the muscles (it's still sore). I don't think they're swollen but I'm also not a doctor, so who knows!I'm also worried my liver might be swollen. I had some tenderness and pain in my upper right abdomen for a few weeks- it stopped hurting though so that's good! But it still feels weird and slightly swollen when I press on it. It feels bigger than the left side. I kept trying to feel if my liver was enlarged- but I also ended up sort of hurting myself with that.I managed to mostly calm myself down about that stuff, since I do have a bit of an on and off scratchy throat so I figured the lymph nodes are maybe just swollen from a cold. Then today, of course, I noticed something else. All of a sudden I have these tiny little red spots (like a pinprick size) all on my arm and some on my leg and back. I know what these are since someone in my family has it more serious, it's petichiae. Which is a symptom of leukemia- as is the lymph nodes and liver thing. 😦 And I have a lot of widespread joint pain. I feel pretty healthy during the day, like I can walk and eat and stuff and I don't have night sweats, but I'm so anxious!!! I really don't want to die. I'm so scared that when I go to the doctor they're going to confirm all my fears. Does anyone have any advice?? Any similar symptoms? I'm feeling really lost and overwhelmed."
"Cancer","Skin cancer?? plz help","I have had this weird bump on my nose for awhile now, at least a year. It's firm and looks like a nose pimple, but it DOESNT GO AWAY! I went on a google frenzy and I'm not sure what size or shape nodules are but now I'm panicking that I might have skin cancer. I've heard stories about skin cancer and I've seen the scars, I'm really scared to have to go through this even if it's vain.The pictures don't do much justice, but I have also notices weird sharp/hard bump-like things on the inside of my nostrils that are white/yellow is and I thought they were hard mucus until I realized they weren't coming out whenever I tried to remove them. When I touch them after awhile they start to hurt and I'm scared it's skin cancer going deep into my nose because it's been left untreated? i don't knowI really need help figuring out what this is because trying to get a dermatologist referral is near to impossible and takes forever."
"Cancer","Leukemia or lymphoma","First of all, I want to apologize about my english, it is my second language. I've been in an enormous stress for a month because of my health I am convinced that I have lymphoma or leukemia. I can't do any daily tasks because my thoughts are always about it. I've been crying everyday since I have noticed swollen lymph node on neck, It's very rubbery, sometimes painful when I swallow food, and it isn't noticeable from outside, but I can feel it. Then, short days after, I have noticed swollen lymph nodes in groin, and they are painful. It's not bumps, it's just like oval form. Then my palms and feet started sweating so much, I have never experienced nothing like this before. Frequently I feel cold, I have chills and fever, but it comes and goes away. Also, I have muscle jerks, sometimes I feel so tired, and my mom told me, because I have not noticed it, that I look skinner. I am nauseaous, dizzy. Every symptom is equal leukemia or lymphoma symptoms. I am literally going crazy and losing my mind, everyday and night I cannot stop crying and thinking that I might have cancer. And the problem is that I am from Europe and every hospital is shut down because of COVID-19, I have no idea when it will work properly and this also another reason why I am freaking out, I cannot check my health with doctors, it looks like everyday I notice something bad. Maybe I won't survive till quarantine is over. I am asking you to help me survive it, and maybe you have experienced something like this and have suggestions what should I do. Thank you."
"Cancer","Health anxiety or Cancer ? ","Hello all.this post is going to be long so please forgive me. i would like to give the whole picture.I was a fit and healthy 29 year old (or so I thought) i had a beautiful 2YO daughter and all was going really well. I fell pregnant with my second and a few things preceeded and this is where my health started to take a strange turn. First I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. Admittedly my diet wasn't picture perfect as I was eating a lot more (bad and oily) carbs to try to curb morning sickness. but my BMI is right at the bottom so nit iverweight or anything like that. The only number that was out was fasting and it was only ever out by .3 at the most! i ended up on insulin for fasting. when I gave birth to my daughter she was born insulin dependent (i had too much insulin in my body and bloody regret ever going on it).Anyway I felt pretty good - bub and I were healthy until one day when I woke up i had this wierd vision disturbance for 15 mins until I ate something. nothing followed went to the doctor and she diagnosed a visual migraine. perfect was on my way and didn't bother me. until the next night same thing happened with the addition of pins and needles and complete out of body experience. went to hospital and everything as I thought I was having a stroke. diagnosed as panick attack. this is where my health worries started. I am going to list below all my symptoms, tests done, and the what my current worry is.they then did a blood test to check my blood sugar, and found two hours after sugary drink (after fasting 8 hrs) that I was actually having hypos. Blood sugar dropped to 2.1 to be exact.Symptoms in order of getting them:After the stroke scare symptoms i got an mri and saw a neurologists all with normal findings.Bone and joint pain especially in knees - tests done included a battery of blood tests and ultrasound on knee and xray on knee. they checked specifically for lyme disease a full blood count, autoimmune and inflamatory markers. All normal.Found lumps on my hip bone and shin bone - ultrasound found a cyst and fatty deposits.Nausea - found I had a tummy virus (from stool tests).Neck pain - ultrasound found somewhat enlarged thyroid gland and thyroid nodules but all looked normal.additional Neck pain and lymph nodes especially one above collar bone - ultrasound showed all normal and called superficial lymph nodes and because I am skinny can feel them more.Chest pain + pain in back and lymph node under arm (or maybe fatty deposits) and boob lump - boob ultrasound and under arm ultrasound as well as chest xray - clear/normal.Pain under (below) both ribs, indigestion, food going down slowly, and severe pain in bag - suspected gall stones so abdominal ultrasound of liver, gallbladder, and pancreas - Clear. also have had about 3 ECG's. have a slightly high cholesterol count but that is improving (it's hereditary).Now I still have the pain bellow rib cage on both sides and an uncomfortable feeling below sternum. pain can be quite bad and quite sharp on left hand side. My bowel movements have changed too (constipated and pebble poops sorry tmi!!) but I have recently changed my diet so that could be a contributing factor.My mums mum died of a heart attack at 37, and dads mum of a brain tumour in her 30's. Dad's sister had breast cancer.i have been worried about having the following:breast cancer, ovarian cancer (pap smear clear), MS, lung cancer, Bone Cancer, Lymphoma, Gosh the list goes on. only because I was so healthy then all of a sudden have gotten these symptoms so it has completely rocked me!Now I am seriously worried I have pancreatic cancer. I am going to ask for an endoscopy but I just want this to end. i can't figure out if there is seriously something wrong and all the doctors/radiologists are missing something, or if I just have a serious case of health anxiety!i had quite a traumatic childhood and my brother and I got taken from my mother when we were 8 in quite a bad way, because she was suffering mental health issues. We then went on to experience some pretty traumatic things from 15+ so I am unsure if this has contributed to my anxiety. i am so worried I will leave my kids at a you g age - infact it is the thing that terrifies me most!if you are still reading thank you so much for taking the time to read my post. ❤❤ Any advice would be amazing!"
"Cancer","Blood test","so i have swelling in my abdomen ive had brown discharge and spotting for a year and bowel issues which have been going on for a while doctors told me it was probably ibs but because i have been getting stomach pains i went back the doctors he said my stomach is distended and ordered bloods my liver and kidney function is fine my iron levels are dropping so hes given me iron tablets and ca125 blood test he said has come back quite high im waiting on ultrasound but with the pandemic i dont know if there is going to be a delay.. he also did a urine test and there is blood in my urine and stool sample which has shown raised inflammation so i need to repeat this and then be reffered for a colonoscopy .. im getting a bit worried does anyone know what could be causing this besides the worse outcome.. i dont have pelvic inflammatory disease endometrios and im not pregnant im only 26 and getting really scared"
"Cancer","Blood test","i went to the doctors today because ive been having abdominal pain and my stomach becoming largehe said my abdomen is distended and i have blood in urine he has gave me bloods to get done one was ca125 blood test i have googled this and it has said it is done to check for ovarian cancer this never crossed my mind should i be worried?"
"Cancer","Cancer or Infection? ","So it all started in late December/early January. My roommates and I got flu-like symptoms. Fever, cough, mucus etc. Eventually we got over it. Or so I thought.Fast forward to the tail end of January (27-28th). Started developing slight vertigo. It would come and go throughout the day (I mostly noticed it in closed corridors or whenever I showered).The vertigo eventually went away however after a few days. Weird.Fast forward a week later, maybe the 8th of February. I started developing ear fullness, and crackling. It was dull but constant .Eventually I got slight facial tension on my cheeks as well. No paralysis but almost like a sunburn or my face being pulled back.I spoke to my mother in law who's a nurse. She checked my ears and noticed they were swollen but no fluid. She suggested Motrin and Sudafed. Maybe it was sinus issue?I used it for one week straight. Didnt work.Eventually the vertigo came back. And now it came back even stronger. This was like the 14th of February.I started freaking out. I would get lightheaded out of nowhere and feel like passing out. My head felt so swollen. Almost as if someone wrapped a belt around my head. So I go to urgent care thinking Im dying. They checked my blood sugar. It was fine. Hemoglobin. Okay. Blood pressure? A little high due to panic attack.The urgent care doctor runs a basic neuro test on me...my finger following her finger, eyes following her finger etc. She checked my eyes and ears and her conclusion was... Migraine. Migraine...I've had migraines before. This did not feel like it.She prescribed me Sumatriptan for headaches and Zofran for nausea. It did not help so a few days later I went to the physician (17th of February).Physician ran the same test as urgent care doctor however he concluded I had middle/inner ear infection due to a virus that stuck around since January.He prescribed me ear drops, Meclizine for vertigo and Ibropufen.Now its been a few weeks since my appointment.My head still feels swollen but not as much during the day as before. Also, my facial tension has slightly diminished. Not as much vertigo. My eyes arent spinning anymore however I still have ear fullness and crackling.That being said, the odd thing is even though some symptoms are diminishing, I feel like I'm developing new symptoms.It almost feels like I am drowsy, drunk. I get tired very easily. Like I need to put my head down during the day.Also my heart rate would spike randomly. I could be resting at 60bpm then all of a sudden it can go to 90bpm as soon I start thinking about it.The best way to describe the feeling is like I have low blood sugar with high blood pressure.Secondly, I would get a throbbing sensation in hands and feet accompanied by cold sensations and pins and needles.Lastly, I feel like I can hear my heartbeat and it feels like its pumping harder.I'd like to note that all these symptoms come and go throughout the day. Some hrs are better than others but still constant every day.Doctor likes to say that its my anxiety due to panic attacks. He says it put a lot of pressure on my nerves. But I'm not sure.Its just so odd. I was perfectly fine leading up to the new year (working out 4 out of 7 days a week) then all of a sudden I'm having all these odd symptoms.Is the doctor right in saying this is an inner ear infection mixed with anxiety?Vestibular neuritis? Cancer?Its on my mind everyday. Maybe thats why I feel so fatigued?5'7 male29 years old175 lbsFilipino MexicanAny advice would be amazing. Thank you so much.*"
"Cancer","9 months of weight loss, swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, and migranes","before i start its important to note i was body building before my issues arose. 9 months ago i was 210 lbs and very little body fat and began getting sick all the time. I had started losing weight pretty quick. as on the 6th i was down to 150. I had a pet scan with positive id on a few locations in my axillary area and inguinal area. they biopsied one from my left shoulder (2.5cm x 2.4 x 1.7 in size). these are the results and they worry my as ive been checked for every environmental factor, immuno panel, wbc, metalabolic panels, etc. everything led to either castlemans disease or a type of lymphoma... yet this is the results from biopsy. im hoping for some insight as its messed my life up pretty bad, from the weight loss, being tired all the time, the strange low blood pressure, the constant headaches all the time, not to mention lymph nodes that have swollen up and won't go away!"
"Cancer","Nail Cancer","Hi, I have developed two black lines on the nail of my big toe. I currently have a nail infection that i discovered a few months ago and I'm treating it. I want to believe that its just splinter haemorrhages from filling and pulling at the nail (i used tiny scissor to lift part of the nail up). But in really freaking out its nail melanoma, keep reading about it and looking at pictures. There seems to be another black line at the edge, near the nail fold. Has anyone experienced this?"
"Cancer","Hemoptysis","I have been experiencing hemoptysis for 4 months with frequent right nasal blockage.No pain, normal diet, no signs of weight loss or anything. Everything is normal except for the blood in my spit.Was referred to a Respiratory Lung Specialist this morning and was told the condition is not serious as everything is normal except for the blood in spit.I requested for a thorough check as there was no medicine prescribed for the last few visit at the GPs and he recommended me to go for a CT scan for my sinus and chest. (Both my parents passed away of cancer). But he highlighted that the downside is CT scan is able to pick up extremely small abnormalities with size of even 2mm to 3mm.I am very afraid of the CT scan that might discover abnormalities. Should I still go for the scan? As i requested for it, was not mandate by the specialist.By the way, was prescribed Triamcinolone Acetonide for my nasal blockage."
"Cancer","Sores in my penis for weeks - Is this cancer!Please help","hi guys,i am 32 years old and the last 2 weeks I have these sores in my penis.since yesterday I have also started to feel a pain/discomfort in my right groin.i have a young family who are dependent on me and I am scared it might be cancer.based on the photo, what you guys think?"
"Cancer","Terrified I might have cancer and don't know what to do","For a few months, I've been having some problems with chest pain and sometimes feeling dizzy or short of breath. The chest pain is worse if I press on my chest, but it also sometimes hurts on its own, and it's completely on and off. So sometimes I won't notice it for a few hours or a few days, then it comes back 😦I went to a doctor (walk in since I don't have a family one), and got referrals for a CBC and EKG- CBC came back normal, haven't gotten the EKG yet. I also got a referral for a chest x-ray, after I kept asking the doctor if she thought it might be a blood clot (she handed it to me and basically said ""you don't need it but if it makes you feel better then here""). Doctor said it was probably just my muscles and told me to take aleve for it, but I'm really worried that it's actually something more serious that they're missing.I'm terrified of getting that chest x-ray because I feel like it's going to show that I have lung cancer. I know that's not common given that I'm 20, so at first I was able to reassure myself a bit, but then I realized that it could be lung cancer that spread from somewhere else, and I just never noticed the symptoms of the primary cancer. I'm so anxious about it that it's really been interfering with my life, and also with my ability to do assignments for school since it takes up so much of my mental energy- I'll have panic attacks and suddenly start crying and spend way too long looking at survival statistics and information about terminal illnesses online D:I know that I have anxiety, but I also know that chest pain and shortness of breath are never good signs. And I swear this feels different from similar health anxiety episodes I've had before. I know that I probably should get the x-ray, but I've convinced myself that it's going to show something terminal and I don't know how I'll cope with waiting for the results."
"Cancer","I NEVER feel hungry, can this be anything other than cancer? Distraught ","Hello, I am a 25 year old male, I've searched the internet high and low but there doesn't seem to be any reassurance out there for me. I lost my appetite seeminly over night about 3 months ago. Over that time I have seen 4 different doctors and they have presribed various things like laxatives and acid reflux as I have also had mild digestive complaints on and off. None of these have had boosted my appetite though. I still enjoy eating and do so to keep my energy levels up, but I never actually get hungry and sometimes I get bloated after meals. I also had a colonscopy (I requested it) to rule out colon cancer and it was all clear so the doctor just gave me anti-anxiety meds assuming my lack of appetite was psychological. Only thing is I'm convinced it's not and have seen another doctor who I persuaded to give me an ultrasound. Doctor doesn't seem too worried though and just seemed to imply I'm a hypochondria. Assuming I am right about the lack of appetite being physical, can I really be anything else but cancer? I'm convinced what I am experiencing now is cachexia, or wasting from late stage cancer. I can't help but think it's pancreatic cancer with liver mets as I also have digestive complaints (have even had floating stools for a while now), I initially considered this just to excedingly rare in people my age but my symptoms just seems textbook. All in all just can't really believe this is happenning and I'm terrified about the ultrasound.Hello, I am a 25 year old male, I've searched the internet high and low but there doesn't seem to be any reassurance out there for me.

"Cancer","Pancreatic cancer cysts - no treatment given?","Hey guys,My grandmother (87) was told today she has low grade pancreatic cancer cysts. The doctor said they won't be investigating into this further as there is no need unless things change or get worse. She was also told she has unexplained cirrhosis of the liver (unexplained as she never drank) and damage to the spleen as they're all connected but she is doing fine.I was in shock and kicking myself now that I didn't ask more questions. I think he said he doesn't think it will change into something big.Has anyone ever dealt with something like this? Is this something that will develop into full blown cancer? Will it spread? Is there anything I can do to stop this and save her?"
"Cancer","Is it Cancer: Swollen lymph nodes in armpit ","a few months back i had somewhat painful lumps in my armpits after a gym session and after some research i chalked it down to irritation from sweat and or antiperspirant, the lumps completely went and i was fine, until recently where im experiencing it again, im not too knowledgeable but to my understanding if it was cancer the lumps surely would of got bigger and not went away but the fact theyre swollen again is a bit scary, i hate the doctors so im wondering if its something i need to get checked or whether i can monitor it myself for any worse progression. Also im aware that they might swell when im ill or fighting off infections, but im not ill now and cant recall being ill the last time it happened, any advice would be appreciated!"
"Cancer","Is this skin cancer?","I'm really worried that this is a BCC. I've had it checked twice by two seperate doctors who have both said it looks like a minor skin lesion or papule. It started off as a small pimple like lump in September and has gotten bigger. It's around 2-3mm on my right cheek closer to my jawline.

The area was too tender to touch and the pain radiated through my jaw and ear. i thought it was a muscle strain and would do away in a few days.it didnt.after a few days my partner found a lump in my neck so immediately i was worried, i seen my GP who has sent me for an ultrasound tomorrow . Once i got home i remembered that about a year ago i found a small tiny lump on the back of my neck, the right side too, i felt it again tonight and im not sure if its anxiety but i feel lts bigger than before.i would just like to hear some experiences or advice. im obviously worried about it being cancer and im terrified"

"Cancer","Brain tumor? I'm scared.","Hi all. My health anxiety is extremely bad now. I'm seeing a Ear Neck & Head specialist Friday and I'm scared they will find a brain tumor. I've made the mistake of looking on Google too much. I've had balance issues for a little over two years now that have come and went, and some weird feelings in my scalp like nerves moving. I may be overreacting but I got so scared just at the thought of having a brain tumor that I started crying the other day. My symptoms haven't really gotten that much worse over the years, and my balance problems haven't caused any falls or anything. But I'm just scared. I can't go out or do anything. I can't even go to the store. Because certain things trigger it. Maybe I have anxiety? Are brain tumor symptoms worse than this? Would it have killed me by now? Thank you. 😦"
"Cancer","Strange mark on back - mole? Should i get a second opinion?","I've had a mark on my back for a month or two - not entirely sure - but it started out as bright red and hurt, but now it doesn't hurt and is a little less red (but still very much red, like a scab) and it is sunken into my skin. I saw my doctor a few days ago and they told me it's a mole because the blood vessels don't disappear when you press on it. They said it looks normal and because of my age is nothing to worry about (I'm 18), but every time I go to see this doctor about something they say that: that I'm too young for it to be anything abnormal, but if this is a mole like they said, it does not look right to me, and I know that 18 year olds can get skin cancer. I have no trust in anything this doctor ever says as it is the same one who told my dad he was dying when that was not the case. They just read their notes off a screen all the time.If anyone has any knowledge of this and could take a look at the picture of it and see what you think I would be very grateful.image"
"Cancer","Blood Cancer?","I have had low lymphocytes (0.7-1.4) for around a year now.I get chills on a night. Im guessing this may be an infection cropping up again. Either that or a vagus nerve attack or whatever they are.Few weeks back I was shuddering uncontrollably and my Neutrophils were high, but have since gone back to normal.I am pale, weak, tired, dizzy and all in all, I look horrid. Random bouts of nausea, and some mucus in my stool. My Faecal Calprotectin is 30 and normal however.I had a swollen groin lymph node back in 2017 and I think it was a little infection.. got rid of the infection, but the node has always stayed the same since.I am obviously worried about Lymphoma, Myeloma, Leukaemia etc.Is there anyone who has had something like this and what were the first signs and stuff?"

I have known about its existence for about a year now and I was worried when I first discovered it. But seeing as how no one else could feel it, i chalked it to me being super tense person with a permanent ""knot."" It has become larger over time, but very slowly, but I have not been worried ever since I decided it was just a ""knot""When i was having my SO dig in, he commented how it felt like a lump not akin to a muscular knot, and that he does not think you can get knots right at the base of your skull. It is on the left side, hard, painless, and does not move. You can't see it, because it is more internal, so you have to feel it to identify its location.Other things I have been experiencing that I have written off as being cause by depression, a monotonous job, simply a low energy person, and dehydration include:-head aches-fatigue (I could sleep forever)Thoughts??"

"Cancer","I have a lump on my scrotum that is growing slowly","Hello!about a month ago I noticed a small lump on my scrotum. Back then it was about the size of a pea but it has since grown a little bit to about 7 millimeters in diameter. The lump is not on a testicle, nor is it on the outside like a pimple but seems like it is inside the skin of the scrotum itself. There is no pain or discomfort. The lump is also pretty firm, and does not feel like it has fluids trapped inside. I dont have insurance but i have started the process of applying for aid, which seems like it will take a few days before i will be able to get somebody to check on it. what is the normal treatment for a cancer that is on the scrotum itself?"
"Cancer","Ghost imagine since 2015","ive had some ghost imaging since 2015 and it was never really bad it was just kinda over a light now its under and over them and i got an appointment with an ophthalmologist im scared i have a brain tumor"
"Cancer","I'm living in a real life horror film!","O.k, where do I begin? I'll start with my theory.I believe I have bowel cancer that has metastasized to my Liver, lungs and brain.Why do I think this?In May of this year I noticed some blood in my stools, I also had an upset stomach and started having night sweats.I reported this to my gp who put it down to stress and hemmoroids.O.k I was happy with this even though he did no rectal exam. He told me to come back in 3 weeks if it continued. It did so I went back. This time he did a rectal exam and found a small pile and told me this is the cause of my bleeding.The bleeding continued even when using the prescribed treatment.I returned to the doctor and asked him to refer me for a colonoscopy. He said it wouldn't be quick but there are some tests he could do to speed it up so I did full blood count test. My liver enzyme, Alkaline Phosphatase was slightly high when I received the results. I didn't know what this meant but the doctors weren't overly concerned.I got a referral for a sigmoidoscopy, which only sees the lower third of your colon. I think they thought I had health anxiety and all they would find was piles and send me on my way... they didn't, a polyp was found, therefore I had to wait for the histology of the polyp and arrange for a full colonoscopy. It was during this time that I started to have some strange symptoms. I had blurred vision and developed tinnitus in my left ear. I was happy to put this down to stress and aging. Anyway the polyp came back benign but another one was found at colonoscopy. I had a strange feeling about the guy who did the colonoscopy, he was quite arrogant and seemed to rush through the procedure, not even noticing the tattoo that was placed at the site of my original polyp or my hemmoroids.Again I had to wait for the lab results of the polyp, I was still experiencing the ear ringing and visual disturbances, now with flashing lights in my peripheral vision and mini black outs.The second Polyp came back benign, Phew! I presumed the other 'stress' related symptoms would subside, they didn't.I also developed intermittent pain under my right ribs, very dark urine and constantly floating stools.I reported all these symptoms to my doctor, several times and asked for my liver function bloods to be done again.Before the nurse took my blood she remarked that my blood pressure was high and was this normal for me? It wasn't, a week earlier it was fine, I was asked to monitor it at home for a week and it just kept getting higher at one point I went to the A and E with heart palpitations and blood pressure of 180/110! I was told it was panic attacks and a psychiatrist spoke to me and sent me home with leaflets about health anxiety.Since then I have felt more and more ill, weak and tired. I've been back to the doctors and a and e several times with these complaints and they now think I'm a crazy hypochondriac and at one point I was very close to being sectioned. I've had a liver ultrasound, a head ct scan without contrast and a chest x ray and nothing was found, this doesn't ease my mind as I know small tumours and lesions don't show up on these scans and I continue to feel really unwell. the scariest are the visual disturbances and the unilateral tinnitus.I went to the ENT about the tinnitus and they referred me for an MRI, however they only looked at my inner ear canals and not the full brain.So here's my theory in full; The Colonoscopy missed a tumour or cancerous polyp. The disease has spread to my liver which is causing my raised enzyme and dark urine. The disease has spread to my brain causing the vision and ear problems.My current symptoms are:- Blurred vision with flashing lights, momentary blackouts, auras when looking at lights, Unilateral tinnitus in my left ear, Night sweats, continued weight loss, Dark urine, liver pain, palpitations, high blood pressure and permanently floating stools.I now feel like the nhs won't touch me as they think I'm nuts, my own friends and family no longer believe me and I feel like I'm dying day by day and no one will believe or help me.I'm so lost.Any advice would be appreciated. This has been going on for 4 months now.I am a 45 year old man who is a teacher not some 14 year old hypochondriac.Thanks. J"
"Cancer","Blood in saliva and pain on the chest","So a few weeks ago I suddenly noticed a had a little bit of blood in my saliva. I searched it up on google and symptoms could be cancer. Yet it all says when you cough it up, I dont know if thats important but I didn't cough it up, in fact I never had to cough. I just spit it out because right after I eat I clean my mouth. Now a few days ago it happened for the 2nd time. But they were both right after I ate baguettes which have hard and sharp crumbs so it could be some kind of wound in my throat? The blood came out of my throat and not my mouth, or at the very least very deep in my mouth. And it was a little bitNow I started to worry when I also got some pain in my chest and on google lung cancer symptoms say that as well. But it's kinda vague what kind of pains in the chest its suppose to be. I only feel a bit of pain in my chest in certain positions but otherwise I feel nothing. It also happened to be turning winter here and I might have gone outside with too few clothing last weekend, so it might be because of the temperature?Am I overworrying?"
"Cancer","Terrified - Melanoma","I have just visited the skin specialist and I’ve left absolutely terrified.

I am set to have it removed in three days but I am absolutely petrified. What if it comes back cancerous? I am only 25 and I am so scared. Has anyone else had similar moles to mine?

"Cancer","Throat pain for a year--new symptoms recently","I'm a healthy male in my 30s. Basically I started getting a bunch of symptoms around this time last year. All of them went away except for the throat pain. I saw an ENT in February iirc who scoped me through my nose and into part of my throat and found nothing. My GP told me it was probably globus sensation and would go away once my antidepressants began to work.The pain still comes and goes, and it's probably a 1 on a scale of 1-10. It can travel up and down the left side of my throat, sometimes hits the right. It feels a bit scratchy usually.Lately I've also had what feels like the pressure from acid reflux without the burning sensation, as well as left ear pain, right around the hole but it seems superficial and is not really achy. I've also had pulsatile tinnitus in my right ear.Obviously I'm here because I'm fearing the worst. I'm getting a little worried because of the length of the symptoms and the antacids not helping much."
"Cancer","gliotic brain herniation...what does this mean?","Just looking at my MRI scan results and it says gliotic brain herniation but i just can't find anything to explain what this is.

Does it effect the central nervous system?"
"Cancer","Pituitary gland macroadenoma removal - state 1 year post-operation","Hello good people!I'm writing on behalf of my mother, who last September had to undergo an tough operation involving the removal of a macroadenoma of the pituitary gland. While the operation was successful, it left her with a hemiparesis on the LEFT side. She was also in a coma for about two days after the intervention. The nasty bugger was apparently massive and had done some major damage to the pituitary gland and reached the hypothalamus, although damage done there was apparently very minor. The epicrisis mentioned about 90% of the tumor having been removed.Post-operation: We've done several MRI scans since then, showing no residual mass in the location with no new signs of a tumor reappearing. We're constantly doing rehabilitation, so she is now able to walk (with our support, still losing balance when in open spaces) and perform various exercises with her hand! 😃 (still can't preform daily activities - long road ahead there!) For medication - she is prescribed Dehydrocortison (5mg tablets, 1 in the morning and 1/2 before bed) and Nootropil (1200mg, twice a day - contains Piracetam). For the first few months, she was also prescribed Citicoline, but has now stopped taking it. I'm not mentioning other minor minerals, vitamins and eating supplements, but can do if need be.However, there are a few things worrying us as far as her current state goes, so I'd like to tell you about them here in the hope of some suggestions as to what we can do to improve those areas...Vision: The RIGHT (not left!) side of her face remains somewhat numb, and her right eye can barely move in all four directions. Opening and closing of the eyelid is fine. She says she feels her ride side as if being ""extruded outwards"". This leads to a weird vision resulting in difficulty of spacial awareness, especially in open spaces outside - leading to a lack of perfect balance. One night I tested her trigeminal nerve sensitivity (temple, cheek and lower edge of the mouth) - all three locations had low sensation, lowest towards the mouth. Maybe some nerves are still constricted? She was prescribed some glasses in accordance to her state, but are there any additional things we can do? We've been told to ""wait"" and that things will slowly get better...Eating is very difficuly. She went from eating pureed foods to regular, firmer foods, but she can't really chew properly - cheek, lips and tongue on the RIGHT side are still mostly numb, so managing food with her tongue inside her mouth is tricky. She only eats on the left side, but food tends to drip sometimes and after a few bites her entire mouth goes stiff. We were recommended injections of botulinum toxin in specific parts of the right side, because she has a hyperactive muscle which apparently needs to be relaxed. We had an ""expert"" perform the manipulation three months ago - there were no improvements... Currently, we are looking to contact another specialist in Slovenia for a second attempt, this time with different injection locations. Apart from botox, is there anything else that might relax her face and allow for easier eating? Medication suggestions are welcome, or even special types of exercises.Walking has progressed a lot, but she still has a major issue when it comes to gait and stance due to her left ankle twisting. Very often, the ankle goes stiff and slowly twists inwards, not allowing her to step with her entire foot on the ground. We were told her gastrocnemius muscle is hyperactive and constrictions are leading to this unwanted twist of the ankle. Some days stepping is fine, others it's a nightmare and her entire gait/walking is outright wrong. We noticed that shock occasions, such as a car passing by close or having to cross a street immediately twist her ankle. We are performing electric stimulations, in addition to lots of massages, stretches and exercises. She is now squatting and has proper strength in the leg, but due to this ankle problem walking is very difficult... Are there any other methods we might apply to improve this? Apart from the gastrocnemius muscle bit, it seems her brain is still heavily susceptible to stress and the commands she is getting are forcing this constriction...Lastly, I should mention that multiple blood tests in recent months showed increased levels of calcium and B12 in her bloodstream. We have an upcoming SPECT scan of here parathyroid glands in a few days, to see if a tumour might be causing this. We were told she should drink lots of water...So, that's that. Sorry for the wall of text! I can provide additional information if needed, like more detailed breakdown of medication regimes, MRI scan reports and so on. Any suggestions are welcome - mainly for the mouth, as eating difficulties are currently the main factor for depression and whatnot... Thanks in advance! 😃"

"Cancer","Thoughts and Suggestions Welcomed ","Hello everyone! I am male, 28 in. a few months.I have been on a long journey seeking a diagnosis. In 2015 I had a swollen lymph node in my groin that been there for months. My gp sent me to a surgeon who discovered I had both a swollen node and hernia. He repaired the hernia with mesh but failed to collect the lymph node. said it ""burst"" which meant it was an infection and not to worry.2016 a new lymph node appears in my groin along with balanitis. GP useless. Urologist useless. both acted as if they had never heard of it before and a urologist should have definitely known! Urologist said sometimes nodes just swell. Balanitis cleared up but not the node.2017 a year passes and the node is still there. They biopsy the node and find it to be reactive only. the node was causing pain so I was happy to have it out either way. 1 month after biopsy a lymph node in my left armpit swells. Doctor suggest as possible allergic reaction so I change everything. soaps, detergents. even toothpaste. This node cause excruciating pain at times. sometimes causing severe swelling. oddly enough if I go for a run or ride the stationary bike the swelling goes down within 30 minutes. I have periods of time where it goes away completely.2018 symptoms continue same as 2017. I am tested for everything HIV, STDs, Inflammation, several cbc and metabolic blood tests. Thyroid levels and thyroid scan. The thyroid scan finds a small semi-solid lesion. follow-up was not recommended. due to new onset of abdominal issues had colonoscopy, endoscopy,2019 two ER visits due to the swelling and pain in my upper left armpit/ breast area. Pain is now worse than it has ever been. In addition pain has now creeped up in myleft shoulder, and right leg. the left shoulder usually hurts exactly when armpit hurts. the leg is pain above upper right calf right above the pit if the knee. Doctor refuses to pay it any attention.. just keeps advising me to take more aleve. A CT of chest performed, they found two 2mm nodules, they said this is common, no follow-up reommendedit is now almost 2020 and. still no diagnosis. should they biopsy another node? suggestions on tests I should request? my mind has me on many things, pancreas (also have persistent abdominal pain), lymphoma, tumor of some kind somewhere, or even a histamine issue.all thoughts are welcomed!"

"Cancer","Feeling zoned out/drunk with head pressure. Please help! ","Hello everyone.I came across this website while searching for the name of the condition I have been dealing with for close to one year now. I hope I can find someone that is dealing or has dealt with a similar condition as I am going through right now. I know that this post is very long so I thank you for your time in advance.I am a 22 year old male and I started to develop my initial symptoms from November 2018. My vision started to feel zoned out when I wasn't zoning out. I don't exactly know how to describe it but it kind of feels like when you are tipsy without dizziness. At times things around me looked slightly blurry. I know that it wasn't to do with my eye sight because a month before I had already got it checked and my eye sight was pretty good actually. So I thought that it was to do with my neurological stuff. I ignored my symptoms for a couple of months and finally in Jan 2019 I decided to visit a local neuropsychiatrist. The doctor prescribed me some pills which I assumed that it was for my neurological stuff but later found out that they were for depression and anxiety. By this point, I developed tingly, pulsating tension between my eyebrows and in the bones behind my ears.I was quite sure that my condition wasn't due to psychological causes so later in Jan I decided to visit a different neurologist in a bigger hospital. I got an MRI of my brain done which came out clean. The doctor told me that she sees nothing wrong with the MRI and that my symptoms are probably linked to my mental health. I took that advice and went to see a psychiatrist who prescribed me antidepressants. I was on the pills for eight months until this August. During the period of these eight months, my condition did not improve at all but in fact became gradually worse until present.My visual perception became worse. Although I can see everything fine it just feels widened out (if that makes sense). In other words, my eyes find it difficult to focus to the point that talking to a person face to face is difficult because the face of the person I am talking appears slightly blurry. I just feel like as if I am drunk or high (that is the closest to how I can put it into words). The tingly, pulsating tension between my eyebrows is still present and when it moves to the bones behind my ears, it feels like my bones are going to break. In addition to these symptoms, recently I started to feel pins and needles on my back. Sometimes it just tingles but sometimes I get this spot on my upper back, right below my neck, where I feel concentrated feeling of pins and needles. In fact, I didn't develop this symptom recently but had it March 2019 as well on my right side right above my lower back but eventually disappeared. The feeling has returned about a week ago. Another symptom that I have been dealing with is that when I turn my head or move my eyeballs, I sometimes get this jerk feeling which runs from my left chest to my left arm.Apart from my physical symptoms my cognitive ability has decreased significantly. I am not able to think clearly anymore. The condition I have been dealing with started to take a toll on me psychologically as well. I am not exactly sure who I am anymore and get this constant detachment between my physical self and mental self. I want to make it clear that the psychological aspect is a consequence of my physical condition.Until date, I have seen multiple neurologists but they haven't been able to figure out the cause behind my symptom since my brain MRI looks clean and the pills I took from my psychiatrists did not help me at all. This condition has really taken its toll on me to the point that I have even lost my zeal to live anymore. I don't like to get out to public places and meeting people has become really hard. If any one of you has experienced similar conditions or has any advice for how I should proceed with it such as medical tests and etc., please let me know. Your smallest help can really make a positive change in my life. Thank you for your help and time."

"Cancer","White patch on upper lip (Photo)","Since 2015 I’ve had this white, painless patch on my upper lip. My dermatologist at the time said it was either folliculitis or fordyce spots, but it never went away like those conditions do. I went to the dentist six months ago who didn’t say anything about it, but I also didn’t bring it up.Now for the last week my upper lip in that area has frequently been pulsating, twitching and weirdly moving a little bit on its own. I did quit drinking alcohol heavily a week ago so maybe it’s part of withdrawals? My eye has also been twitching, but not as much as this. Thanks."

"Cancer","Symptoms","Hi everyone,Over the past few weeks I've been experiencing a lot of issues with my throat. Twice I've woken up unable to swallow saliva, my mouth is constantly dryI'm not someone who regularly goes to the doctors/hospital. Not once in five years prior to this, but both times I ended up in A&E, I was checked over and after blood tests told it was an infection (first time) and a virus (second time). I was then referred to an ENT clinic, where I had a camera down my throat, all was ok.However It's now been 6 weeks where I've felt tired, had an irritable throat that responds badly to things like caffeine, and the **main worry, two swollen lymph nodes on the right side of neck.**The nodes have been swollen the whole time, they decrease and increase in size regularly. I did some reading and saw a major symptom of Hodgkins Lymphoma is Lymph nodes swelling after alcohol, mine are definitely doing this, even after 1 or 2 beers, nothing major.I'm on edge and want Cancer to be ruled out, but I feel as if I've not been taken seriously by the doctors I've seen. Surely lymph nodes shouldnt be swollen for 6 weeks even during a virus? I've experienced no weight loss or night sweats, but the swelling and constant fatigue, as well as reaction to alcohol makes me think this is more than a virus.Would be greatful for any advice, thanks."

I was taking some clonazepam and alorazapam off and on for the past 4 years, but NEVER everyday, maybe as needed like 2-3 times a week. ive noticed that these symptoms seem to spike a day or two after working out. heres a list of these symptoms:-severe ringing in ears-face feeling flushed hot, and feet, while fore arms feel cold-muscle twitches all over body, random pain behind eye and ears-headache-random pounding heart-depression and hopeless, lack of ambition,-weird sensation in throat, not pain but feeling kinda cold or like i have to hack up flem,-sensitivity to cold to touch skin,-feeling slightly aggresive and jumpy,-weird sensation like a brain zap or shivers at random(like when you get when you pee)I realize these are confusing but i dont know where else to turn? im a 33 year old male, i dont do drugs and after these symptoms starting coming on i quit drinking alcohol. These symptoms seem to peak after 2 days after working out or weight training, im so confused! I havent taken any benzo for over 5 months, what the hell is going on with me ??"

"Cancer","Mole changed shape!","I’ve had a recent cancer scare with a spot on my face. And I am going to see a doctor about it to hopefully give me the all clear. However, I noticed today, a flat mole on my collar bone, has now developed lumps in it. I’m not sure how to act? Am I paranoid because of my prior scare? Does it look misshapen and indicative that I need to get it checked out ASAP?"
"Cancer","Do I need to get this checked out?","this was when i first noticed a lump, bump, or spot which is what i think it is.a couple of weeks later, this pimple starts ""splitting"" purple. i still havent touched the bump because 1)there have been no whiteheads and it's quite flat to the skin.i hadnt paid much attention to it, but then i noticed it really started changing colour. at this point its borderline black/very deep purple. i still hadnt began to worry or track its progress at this point.One day all my family were around and they notice this large purple area on my face. They began to worry me by saying you need to get this checked out ASAP! I started worrying then, and tracking its progress. Then my auntie said a week later that it’s a swollen/inflamed pore. So I relaxed a bit but still tracked progress.One morning I decided to take a closer look at it. This was two weeks ago. Then I wanted to see how far the purple area actually spread so I saturated the picture. I sent the picture to my friend and showed my mum and they thought nothing of it. At this point I’m researching different skin cancers and nothing quite resemble it, but nor do my other spots either.The first time I properly noticed a bump was the 26th of May. The first time purple started coming through was the 23rd of June. And it’s been changing shape, size and colour ever since. In total, gathering from the very few pictures I have, as far back as May, I have had the progressive spot for 86 days, or 2 months and 25 days. Nearly 3 months.Do I need to worry? Do I need to get it checked asap? I shared the new pictures from today with the same friend I sent them to before, and she is also increasingly worried!"

"Cancer","Possible melanoma? Or anxiety?","March 2017 I noticed I had an itch on my back, while scratching i noticed a painful bump (felt like when you get a painful pimple) so i figured maybe its just a pimple. So I left it alone and it stopped hurting after a day or 2 but never went away. So i googled what it could be and melanoma popped up. Okay so now Im scared. I stupidly googled how to self remove a mole and found a baking soda method. It made my mole scab then fall off...and about a week later it grew back, the same but slightly darker. So i left it alone and it never bothered me. Until june 2019 again I scratched my back and knicked the dumb thing and part of it scabbed and healed. Again it grew back the same but a little darker. My anxiety took over and i went to a clinic to see a GP. He said it didnt look dangerous, ""melanoma usually have sharp edges and yours doesnt look that sharp"" he diagnoaed me with depression and anxiety... but still everyday i take pictures of this mole to monitor it and see if anything changes, i also constantly rub it to see if it causes pain (it doesnt) today I noticed two small dots in it and Im out of my mind going crazy. I made an appointment but its not till the end of the month.Does this look like a melanoma to you?"

"Cancer","Melanoma","Hi, I am hoping there is someone I can talk with as I am trying not to show my worries to my family. I go to the bathroom to cry which is pretty often.I blame myself that I got into this mess. About one month after I gave birth (I was 41 years old) a tiny dark flat mole suddenly appeared on the side of my knee about 2-3mm, I noticed it because I virtually have no moles, maybe a hand full of what you might call freckles here and there. I thought it was just post pregnancy moles, because I also got skin tags and lots of cherry angiomas as well. I just labelled it as my ugly mole and never considered it could be something of concern Three years on, this mole never went away, I never found it suspicious because I am quite uneducated with regards to moles and melanomas since I never saw myself having a mole problem. NAIVITY at it's finest!.About a month ago I read up on mole melanoma and looked closer at my one mole. I became concerned because I had spent most of my youth in the sun unprotected. I have also used tanning beds in the past I am a dark haired but have light coloured mediterranean skin that does not burn so easily. I can probably sit in the sun for a good 30-40mins before I start to burn and even then, by the evening it will just turn to a tan colour. I think I might be skin type 3 or 4. But as a child I never had sun protection and as a young adult I have to admit I pushed my boundaries and have burnt myself like a red lobster several times.I blame my stupidity and ignorance now and hate myself for it. So a few days ago I visited the dermatologist, while I don't think the mole ever grew or evolved much, it caused serious visual concerns to the dr, who had it immediately removed and sent for a biopsy. She told me she doesn’t think its melanoma but probably atypical but really, how does she know this? I have to wait 12 days for the biopsy results and I don’t know how I can last until then. I am an emotional mess, I don’t know how to cope. Every research I have done points to the fact that most likely its cancer and probably spread since I allowed it for years to sit on my leg and it had a good chance to spread in my body.I don’t except anyone to diagnose me on this forum, just someone to talk to because I can’t do it with my family. my husband thinks I am overemotional and every time i look at my 3 year old, I cry. I have convinced myself that it's melanoma, and after 3 years of doing nothing, I allowed it to spread to my body and that I am going to die soon. I am scared, I want to see my son grow up more than anything and I want to be there every step for him. He won't remember if I die, he's too young.sorry for my ramblings, as I said before, I am an emotional mess."

"Cancer","Chronic daily headaches worse in the morning and irritability, I'm worried about a brain tumour.","Hello, this is my first post, apologies if it's in the wrong place!Long story short -Chronic headaches for the past 4 to 5 months, they have become more constant to the point where they are daily and worse in the morning.I've also been dealing with irritability for the past while, I get easy frustrated and I'm very easy to anger.I get my pocket or headphones caught on door handles or zippers and I rip the zipper open or punch/slam the door.I'm also depressed to a certain extent, very pessimistic and somewhat anxious.The headaches are the main symptom they've gotten worse and more frequent over the past while (this being before I went to hospital). They're on top of my head and I can usually point to the spot of pain, it's usually my right side at the top roughly an inch forward from my ear/middle of upper head.I went to my GP, I was referred to hospital, I went to A&E, who sent me to the Acute Medical Unit.Blood tests - Normal.Head CT - Normal.EKG(ECG(?)) - Showed an irregular heart beat, I didn't have that before - Cardiology said it's nothing to really worry about.Chest X-Ray - Showed a slightly enlarged heart, they thought I might be an athlete, I'm not but I'm in okay shape.They gave me paracetamol and Neurofen - Neither had any positive affect.I was given a prescription of 10mg Amitriptyline for 3 months (currently 1 and 1/2 months in) and a week of Tramadol for the pain, Tramadol did not help, I stopped for a while and swapped to Solpadol - also very little affects.Booked in for an MRI of my head - which I had today.Booked in for an Ultrasound of my heart, and a consultation with a headache specialist after the 3 months on the medication.As of now I'm back taking the tramadol - ran out of Solpadol (I had for a chest infection/pleurisy from before) and I have tremors in my hands, feel somewhat dizzy and still have a bad headache as I'm typing this.I'm still on the amitriptyline.I have an Aunt who has a brain tumor her symptoms were severe headaches, worse in the morning and persistent.She's had radiation to shrink it, and is having regular MRIs to monitor it.I'm worried it might be a tumor.The neurologist mentioned cluster headaches, but they're not that bad and I have a low grade headache most days, with intermittent intense stabbing headaches.Also my eyelid was swollen because I'm prone to chalazions/styes so unless he thought that was a symptom.I know that CTs are used to check for larger abnormalities, aneurysms, clots, bleeds etc and an MRI is used to check soft tissue abnormalities like tumors, cancers etc.Obviously it's not very big if there even is anything there.But I'm still concerned, and I think it's rational rather me being a hypochondriac.I had my eyes tested first thinking I needed glasses, I don't but the optician saw tortuous veins which indicate high blood pressure, I got that checked and it's normal..And when the medication isn't helping, the pain isn't subsiding and my mood is very much the same..What would cause an enlarged heart?Am I being crazy?Could anyone share their story?What would cause these symptoms?"

"Cancer","Could this be the cancerous mole?","Before I write anything, let me inform you that I have a family history of cancer. My dad had mouth cancer and my granny had it in her skin. Both died eventually..Nothing could save them because it was either too late or too extreme.Now, let's talk about myself shall we? I barely have mole all over my body if any at all. About 2 years ago, I woke up one morning with a weird kind of wound on the back of my right hand. I didn't realize that it was a wound at that moment and brushed it hard against my bedsheet to get the thing (in my mind) away from my hands.. On checking back, I found out that I had removed the upper tissue in the process (and the red skin underneath was visible ofc). I still didn't pay much attention as I am used to getting wounded every so often. But this was a different one which took really (I mean it) long and left behind a scar which is unusual to say the least.When viewed from different angles, it looked like dead rotten tissues in the shade of 'ash gray' (That's exactly how it looked).A year later, I was involved in another minor accident and got my skin around the mole (including it) peeled off in the process. I thought okay, goodbye old scar, welcome new one. This second wound healed, and left NO scars except the old one in the same old irregular shape. It was like a carbon copy. This made me think something's surely off. Why did so large a wound leave nothing but the one as before. Sure enough, it's color was still the same!File size is too bigI started looking up on the internet and I think I probably have skin cancer. At this point, the mole has started spreading a little further. The 'ABCDEs of Melanoma' in WebMD made me consider and investigate all these. Here are some pictures of that mole for you to observe it thoroughly.File size is too big"
"Cancer","I am checking my mouth and I am extremely worried that its cancer.","So I was checking my mouth for any sign of cancer. I am having 3 problems.One is a white looking bump in my lateral mouth. It is oval shaped and it has a rubber like texture and feel (it flicks when moving it). It show more white color when pressed. No pain.here is the pic:Another one is the area behind the molar. It seems to be opening itself up, the color inside is grey it feels hard, like a tooth.here is the pic.![image](https://patient.azureedge.net/forums/images/upload-sm/1253560-on the 636982448911516642.jpg)and finally the one that cause me to fear the most is my tonsil on the right. It is slightly bigger than my left tonsil. It may not be so bad until it is shaped very differently. It is bean shaped, smooth and painless, and has white liquid stuff that spews out when pressed. The thing that made me more concern is that its duration is long overdue. I have this tonsil since May and I recall having this in years.I tried to convince my mother that the tonsil is shaped funny and I need to go to an ENT but she refused, stating that ""it is all over your head"".I also check my lymph odes in my neck and it is normalwhat could I do ?"
"Cancer","Weird feeling in head for awhile now.","This one is going to be long, so sorry in advance.So about a couple months ago I woke up and went to go eat breakfast and all of a sudden I my head started to feel weird and I got a brief blind spot in the corner of my left eye. I felt confused and I thought I was going to faint.I went down to lie down for a bit and all of a sudden I started to get chills. This lasted for about an hour and then the symptoms subsided and I felt ok. I went to the eye doctor and they did a scan and said what I probably experienced was on Ocular Migraine and it wasn't anything to worry about.So of course stupid me just writes it off as nothing. Few months pass and I experience the same thing on March 11th around 3pm , but this time without the blind spot or halo in the eye. Just weird feeling in my head, like something was off and I was about to lose control accompanied by almost a hypoglycemic feeling, ( I hadn't eaten since 10am that day ) followed by chills that lasted about an hour. I thought maybe since i hadn't eaten anything I was feeling shaky or weird so I had something to eat.Ok I said, if this happens again I'm going to the doctors. The next day it happened again. I immediately made an appointement with my primary care doctor . We checked for Diabetes, Lyme Disease, Low Blood Sugar, Hypoglycemia, and all that stuff and everything came back fine on my blood work.Doctor said it's anxiety but I don't really have much stress in my life at the moment and I do get anxious when I'm in a social setting but nothing like this. After this second episode I felt very disconnected and almost in a haze or heavy brain fog for a week or so.When I went for a follow up visit on the 27th of March on my way to the Doctors office my head felt weird again like I was about to lose control or in the foggy state. I was scared to drive home but the feeling passed after awhile. When I told him about it he just brushes it off.He did the all the typical neurological tests to see if my arm and leg strength were ok, following his fingers , standing up straight , walking in a straight line etc. Everything checked out.Now when I wake up in the mornings my head feels weird again. And if I touch the top of my head it makes the feeling worse. Its just a very concerning thing. I don't know if it's anxiety and I'm not sure if this can be related to a gut issue as my stools have been loose and flat . Docs thinks i might have IBS . I'm being tested for Celiac and IBS.He says I don't need to see a neurologist so I can't see one unless he gives me a clinical referral . I'm just worried its something more than anxiety because when I touch my head in feels worse. I don't get headaches but man when I get the feeling I feel confused and really weird."

"Cancer","Sharing my dads pancreatic cancer story","So, i'm new here and not really sure why i'm writing this, maybe it will just help to cope.I saw others sharing their/their relatives stories on here, so here's mine.Long story short, for the impatient: My dad was diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer in February 2019, less then 2 months later, on April 1st, he passed away.Here's the long version.My dad has been more or less seriously sick for over a decade. As long as i remember, he was quite a bit overweight and had diabetes, the ""milder"" form, so he didn't need shots but had to check his bloodsugar every day and control his diet. He was a smoker since he was a teenager and also liked drinking every once in a while.About 15 years ago, he had a kidney infection, performance of both kidneys went down to 10% - permanently. At this time, he had to retire and go to dialysis 3 times a week, which he tolrated pretty well.His pension was rather small, but my mom had (and still has) a good income so my dad became the housemaker, did the shopping and cooking and took care of my little sister who still went to highschool at this time. My bigger sister and me were already working and financially independent, so despite my fathers disease, my parents were living a good life. They always loved to travel and my dads health condition did not stop them. They went to the Canary Islands and Croatia every year, even cruises were not a problem, there are plenty of vessels with dialysis on board. Once my little sister left the nest, my dad got very active as a volunteer, he was president of the local sports club for 8 years, board member of the local hiking club and so on. Life was good.In the mean time, i had to travel all over the world for work. 4 weeks in the US, a week in Canada, a week at home in Germany, 5 weeks in Japan, that was my life and i also liked it. In 2014, my employer offered me to work at ourbranch in Shanghai for 2 years. I sayed yes and while i'm typing this now, i'm still sitting here in China.In December 2018 my sisters son was born and my wife gave birth to our daughter 5 weeks later, last year, both my sisters got married. My mum usually visits us in China once a year, we would go Germany every summer and christmas for a few weeks. While my dad was still able to travel, the 12 hour flight to China would have been to long, so he could see his grand daughter only twice a year. Last year, we spent 5 weeks in Germany, i had to work, so my dad spent most of his time with my wife and our daughter.They loved cooking together, especially since my dad was always keen to try new things in the kitchen and my wife taught him a lot about chinese cusine. My wife really loved her ""Opa"" - the german word for grandpa, which is what everybody in the family called him since he became a grandpa.In December 2018, we celebrated my dads 60th birthday, big party, around 70 people were there. At this time, i already noticed that he didn't look so well, somehow exhausted or burned out but he was in a good mood and said he was alright. I think it was more obviously to me then others, because i saw him only every couple of months.Then things changed. My mom had her trip to visit us in China booked for end of March. Every sunday, we're doing video calls, so i was kinda surprised, she called on a weekday.I knew something was wrong from the very first moment, i could see it in my mums face. Then she told me. At dialysis, they checked my dads blood several times a week, but due to his kidney disease, some values always went basically through the roof. Anyway, they were concerned about one certain thing that was oddly off (don't remember which one) in his blooed count and sent him to MRI. There they found tumors at both kidneys, liver, stomach and pancreas.Since it already spread that much, they first didn't know were the cancer originally came from, but they eventually said, it's the pancreas. Surgery was not an option, but my dad started chemo therapy right away and tolerated it well. I'm not sure if it made a difference after all, but even though it was clear that his cancer was already terminal, chemo therapy gave him hope, i think. He only went to the Hospital for treatment, from being diagnosed until passing away, he didn't have to spend a single night there.My mum cancelled her trip to China but told me not to worry to much even though the doctors said, that worst case, he'll only have a few months left.First i was thinking to fly to Germany right away, but my mum knew i had a lot of work because a major exhibition in our business was comming, so we booked a flight for end of April.My mum also told my little sister not to cancel her holiday. Her and her husband were going to visit us in Shanghai and then go to Thailand and Sigapore afterwards.So a few weeks went by, we called my parents a lot and it seemed like my fathers condition was stable. My sister spent a week with us, then flew to Thailand, the day after they left China, my mum called.It was a Wednesday, 27th of March. She said dad was not doing well and the doctors can't tell whether he has 2 months or just 2 weeks left - that's when i got really nervous.There were two options for flying to Germany, either next day, which would have been tough to organize, especially with our toddler, or Monday, 1st of April. Again, my mum told me not to worry to much,so we booked the flight for monday. I got a positive reaction at work - this was really the busiest time in 2 years - my manager said i could leave right away and as long as i needed to.Saturday my mum called again, my dad was looking good, he went shopping in the morning and made BBQ for the rest of the family that was working in the garden that day, that made me feel better.Next day my sister called me from Thailand, she was crying. She said mum just called and asked them to come back as soon as possible. Since i'm the more experienced traveller, i helped my sister arranging flights, they were arriving almost the same time at Munich airport as our flight from Shanghai, so we could even share a rental. I was thinking about calling my mum again this sunday, but eventually didn't. I just texted her that everything for my sister and me was arranged and we'll be home tuesday morning.She just replied that she's sure i got everything well under control. Monday, our flight was at night, so i went to work in the morning to settle everything before leaving. After lunch, we started packing and i don't know why, but i suddenly started crying. I told my wife that i was afraid were gonna be to late and i just wanted to see him one last time. She was trying to stay positive, said that he's probably still got months leftto live and told me how she will take care of him and cook his favourite chinese dishes once we're there.Tuesday early morning, we arrived at Munich airport, met my sister and her husband there and got our rental car. I drove that route a 100 times before, but this time, the 2 hours felt like ages.Somehow, at that time i was worried most about my little sister, who was always my dads baby girl.When we got to my parents house and the door opened, i could feel my heart beating like a hammer.My bigger sister and my mum were standing there, dressed in black, i instantly knew what happend before she said anything, but i'll also never forget her words:""He wanted to wait for you, but he just couldn't make it.""My father died one day before, 4:30 in the morning.We flew around half the globe and were just like 30 hours to late.But here comes the hardest part: My wifes german is not perfect and my mum spoke dialect, so she wasn't sure if she understood and asked me: ""Where's Opa? How is he?"" And i had to tell her that we were to late.It crushed her. The days before and during the whole trip she was staying positive and trying to cheer me up, but that very moment eventually really crushed her. I don't know what was harder in this very moment, the death of my father of seeing my wife like this. She really loved him and only had the chance to know him for several years.My mum then told us how everything happend.Saturday, my dad had a really good day, he felt well and didn't even need any pain killers.Sunday morning, he couldn't even get out of bed himself anymore, his blood pressure was down to 90/50. An aunt, my dads sister, who is a nurse on the cancer ward where my dad had his chemo therapy was there the whole day. In the evening, he was in a lot of pain, so my aunt called one of the doctors to visit off duty. After giving him pain killers by infusion, he did better, but still couldn't get up. They were dicussing about taking him to the hospital, but my dad insisted on staying at home. My mum said, she somehow knew it was going to end soon when she realized, that he didn't even have a single cigarette the whole day. This was the first day in almost 40 years of being together she didn't see him smoke.Around 9, when my mum went to bed, dad was doing quite ok, they talked a lot. He even asked when she was going to work tomorrow and who's gonna take care of dinner.Midnight, he had difficulties breathing, so my mum helped him sitting up, they were sitting for 20 minutes till he felt better and then lay down again. They repeated that several times.Eventually, my dad said, ""I can't take it anymore"", he closed his eyes and was gone.My mum was holding him and said ""Don't go, stay here, stay with me!"", but he was gone.She said she then kissed his cheek and wished him a good journey.The next few days we were busy arranging the funeral, my wife asked if she could see him for a last time and i was also thinking about it - open coffin at the funeral is not common in Germany.I kept thinking ""Why didn't we just come a few days earlier?"".Usually a few days pass between death and funeral, so they offered to open the coffin for us to say good bye. One of my aunts recommended us not to do this, she said she did that twice when relatives passed away and ever since, she can't get that picture out of her head anymore. I told my wife i'd go see him with her if she wants to, she told me the same, but eventually we didn't. Looking back, i think it was the right choice, i remember my dad as the happy man living his life, celebrating christmas and his 60th birthday, that was the last time we saw him in person.I was a bit afraid about the funeral, but i gotta say, it was much easier as thought. My dad was a well known man in our small town, there were literally hundreds of people.We then spent the next 4 weeks with my mum before going back to China, especially having her grand daughter around helped a lot.I was thinking a lot to try to find some positive things in all the sadness and i found them in deed:My dad died in his own bed at home, in the arms of the woman he loved, he was married to for 35 years and had 3 kids with. He didn't have to suffer for long. I always thought it was kinda weird when people said ""at least he didn't have to suffer"", but i have to admit it's true. I saw my grandma, she was already 82, fighting cancer for 2 years, she really had to suffer a lot.He had a good life and didn't spend his last 6 months in a hospital, connected to machines that barely keep him alive. My grandma used to say, ""better 20 years of peace then 40 years of war"", i think that's true. My dads life might have been to short, but he was able to enjoy it almost till his last day.In the end, his body wasn't strong enough anymore, but his mind was clear until the last moment and wanted to fight.It may sound surprising, but i think my brother-in-law was hit hardest. His father left his family when he was a little boy, he never met him. My dad was probably his best friend and he saw him as the father he never had.The hardest time for me was actually the day before we went to Germany and the inital shock. And somehow, now, 2 months later. My dad and me were never really close, at least i thought we weren't, but now i miss him like hell.In quite moments i keep thinking about when my mum told us how he died and start crying. But, i think it's getting better. Everytime i talk with someone about it, it get's a bit easier. Maybe that's why i'm wrinting all this. Maybe i just needed to write it down.Charlie"

"Cancer","Lump in the inner cheek ","Hello,So like a month ago I woke up with a big, white lump inside my cheek right next to my gums. It really came out of nowhere as I haven't noticed anything earlier. After a day it wasn't white anymore and what was left was just a small lump. I didn't think much about it and just let it be, thinking that it would go away but it didn't even after a month. It got a little bit bigger but I barely can feel it with my finger and I have to use my tounge (it isn't noticable without touching it with a tounge). Can it be oral cancer? I searched online and I don't have any other sympthoms. I mean, I have some loose teeth and would sometimes struggle to speak some sentences but it was with me all my life. I'm turning 18 in 3 months and I've been smoking irregurarly ciggaretes for maybe 1,5 of a year and drink alcohol for the same amount of time but I drink only on the parties (which happen maybe every 1-2 weeks). It also deasn't hurt or anything. Idk if it matters but I remamber that I bit my tounge like a day before the lump happened. After a month I'm getting pretty worried, because it doesn't seem to be going away. Does anyone have some clues what might it be? Thanks for helping 😃."

"Cancer","scan error?","Hi,so one of my best friends was diagnosed with skin cancer about 1.5-2 years ago (a melanoma to be precise). He found it pretty quickly and the treatment didn't wait too long too, which happened here in Belgium in September 2017: removal of a section of skin and lymph nodes on the upper leg and groin area. In the consequent checkups, they didn't find anything and so didn't perform chemotherapy.In the meantime he moved to Canada where he did another routine checkup just this Monday and they found a bright dot on the liver on the scan (don't know what kind of scan it was).They say it was likely just a ""scan error"" or a minor internal wound, in both cases it would be gone within a few weeks, but in the meantime there's more playing in our heads:Back in Belgium, there was a patient next to him who was terminal due to diagnostic error, so I do believe in doctors, but also in their mistakes. Such an uncertainty eats at our moods as a tumor could be eating his liver.So the question is: why did the doctor go over it like it was no big deal? Is (s)he used to soothing patients whatever the ordeal? Are scan errors that common? Or internal lesions? Is the timing or location illogical? Because it doesn't look like it 😦"
"Cancer","Brain tumor fear","Hi everyone. I've only been having two symptoms. One is vertigo, which comes and goes. The other, I'm not sure how to explain it. When I raise my eyebrows it's like I can feel something moving in my head. Kind of feels like a loose nerve or something. And when I raise my eyebrows and feel that, it causes the vertigo, too. I went to a concert the other day, and in the middle of the crowd it got really bad. It also gets really bad when I'm in stores. I'll be really dizzy until I get back in the car. That feeling in my head when I raise my eyebrows is SO ANNOYING. And it moves! It never stays in the same place. Anyways, I'm scared. I have convinced myself that I have a brain tumor or some other kind of serious problem."

"Cancer","Weird headache with pressure on my skull. What is this? Please Help! ","I've been having this ongoing headache on the left side of my forehead for more than 3 months now. Sumatriptan helps however the pain is still present. It will feel warm and numb in the area until the medicine wears off. I notice that the pain becomes increasingly worse when bending over, or straining when having a bowel movement. Once the pain gets worse I would get very nauseous and feel overall unwell. I also have a very large and dark floater in my left eye, and during a headache attack, regular speaking voices hurts my ears. Anything louder is horrible! In addition to the headache, my skull in the left side forehead area feels sore. Like the actual bone feels pressured almost like lightly pushing a rock again your shin but on my forehead (is the best way I can describe it).So far blood tests were normal all except for my cholesterol was high. I have a brain mri with contrast scheduled in March but I am afraid that waiting can be risky. I simply need answers if it's serious. Any idea what this can be? I'm so scared and worried!

"Cancer","Mole has changed","Hi,I'd like to start off by saying that I've put this thread in this forum because it relates to the topic at hand, but I am not diagnosed with anything of the sort. I am hoping to get some advice, and/or reassurance.I've recently noticed something odd about a mole I have on my left thigh. It's darker than all of the other moles I've had - all of my other moles are a light brown, whereas this one is significantly darker. I noticed it itching and when I went to scratch it, it felt rough and slightly crusty, but there is no actual crusting i.e no skin has peeled off. It's slightly raised in my skin in comparison to my other moles. I went to look at it closer and noticed that it has small black dots and flecks in it - none of my other moles has anything like this. It's not asymmetrical or anything, but it does have a small patch coming out of the main mole area (that's the best way I can describe it haha.) This is only if I look really close. A few days ago when I ran my finger along it or pressed slightly it would hurt. Nowhere near excruciating, but it was a very weird sensation. The pain I would get from brushing against it is minimal now but I still do feel it a bit. Again nothing actually worth wincing over but noticeable.I'm pretty sure I've had this mole all my life but I don't know entirely as I have quite a bit. I have about 40-50 obvious ones. I'm fair skinned and have blonde hair. I've always been a bit of a hypochondriac so I don't know if this is just me worrying about nothing. I have a check up with my GP on the 2nd of May anyway, and I probably will mention it, but can anyone here maybe give me some insight on what it may be or just give some advice? I don't want to assume it is a melanoma or anything serious; I mean from a distance it looks like a regular mole. But close up it's so odd (at least to me) and I don't think it's normal to feel pain, or for the mole to be rough to the touch. It's darker than all of my other moles. If anyone can provide some clarification I'd be really grateful.If it's useful: I'm 18 and female. Also, I rarely go outside and expose my skin to sunlight. If I do, and I know it's going to be very sunny, I will put on sun screen. Although I will admit, I do tend to neglect certain areas of my skin. I've had pretty bad sun burn twice but it was on my shoulders and back, not my legs. The oddest thing about it to me is the black flecks in the mole. They are clear cut streaks or dots - to the point where they distinctly contrast with the colour of the full mole. I've never seen that before in any of mine.Anyway, thanks for reading, and please reply if you can provide any advice or really anything to just calm me down haha"
"Cancer","Anyone ever had a lymph node remain swollen but benign? ","im a 23 year old male. about 5 months ago i had a pretty sever case of laryngitis and got on anti biotics to clear it. it worked however shortly after stopping the anti biotics my lymph nodes on the left side of my neck swelled. they were not painful even at first, they are only about the size of a pea to a bean. i must emphasize they were not there prior to the illness as im very body conscious and i also have none of them on the right side. my doctor agreed it was odd so ordered a chest x ray, that showed very minor fluid so they did a Ct scan which was clear (the fluid was from my body fighting off the remnant of the infection they assumed since it was gone) after this i was told to wait a few weeks and the nodes should shrink however they didnt, my doctor then checked me for mono, Tb, HiV AND EVERYTHING under the sun in my blood work, the only oddity was my B12 was very minutely low which was assumed because i had hardly been eating. The doctor then ordered an ultrasound of the nodes, it showed nothing out of the ordinary besides stating they were slightly enlarged with the largest being just under a centimeter and i had a 5mm cyst on my thyroid. I was sent to a thyroid specialist who was unconcerned about that. I also seen an ENT who said my nodes didnt worry him at all however he abd my doctor disagree on them going away; my PcP said my nodes are most likely 'scarred' or nodes that respond to infection and dont ever return to normal size while the ENT said they probably will go down someday.my concern is if they missed something, I know the nodes arent big but there are 5-7 of them in my neck that size asymetrically just on one side. they have been there for 4 months now (nearly 5) with no change and i have read about slow growing lymphomas like Hodgkins etc that can take years to fully manifest. i really want a biopsy but they all say my nodes dont 'meet the criteria' but i know that ultrasound is not the definitive test here. Has anyone else had nodes that never quiet returned to normal size? several doctors seem sure they are of no concern but since none can explain them, or even agree if i should expect them to stay, should i be concerned?"

"Cancer","Pressure, hot head pain on left side temple. Brain tumor? ","Hello all,I want to make this brief. So since elementary school I have been suffering from headaches. My Dr at the time associated it with eye straining and had me wear glasses, however the headache still always remained and I've learned to deal with them by resting or taking over the counter pain reliever. Now that I am in my adult hood, the headaches have now been fully diagnosed as chronic migraines and I take sumatriptan and excedrine migraine to get temporary relief. It seems as within the last 6 months my headaches took a turn for the worse as I am now experiencing severe symptoms. I am a 34 years old female and here are the symptoms I now suffer with.Localized pain only on the left temple above eye brow.Pulsating hot sensation on left temple.Severe headachewhen bending over.Severe headache when having bowel movement.Sound sensitivity and pain with loud noises.Ear ringing and vertigo.Eye floater in left eye for the passed 2 years.Flashes of light when eyes are closed in both eyes.Nausea usually by the end of the night.Weakness/flu like symptoms without fever on site of migraines.Pressure in head and eyes like my head will explode and eyes would pop out when laying flat.Loss of appetite usually by dinner time.Today I've had blood work done and I am waiting to get my official MRI date scheduled.

I do suffer from bad anxiety since I was little (I think it's a genetic thing, my mum has it) but it scares me a lot, also the other week I had to go to the ER because I was bringing up blood in my phlegm, it started as little to no blood but then got more and more, kind of a bright red as if something was bleeding.. I produced probably a little more than a tablespoon, the doctors couldn't find out what was wrong with me despite taking X-Ray's too.. I'm really scared because I'm only 18,, It isn't possible I have throat cancer...This is the picture of the blood I was bringing up in my phlegm, it isn't good quality but I was pretty scared and wanted to show my boyfriend, I was also a few minutes away from when I was close to passing out, was losing my vision, hearing, hot and cold flashes.."

He wanted to schedule another MRI in a few months to double check. He didn't seem worried but I know that a ""shadow"" on the brain is never a good thing and I'm anxious that it might be a tumour.

Its constant in the sense that I feel it every day. It's worse when I'm driving, but I can't stand for long amounts of time. I'm pretty tall, so it could be my posture, but it feels like I'm too young for that to be affecting me this much? I'm not sure, but a couple weeks before that started, I was experiencing blood in my stool. I wrote this off initially as hemorrhoids, but It's now been 6 weeks and hasn't stopped. It's usually not a large amount of blood, but my doctor prescribed me anti-inflammatories and a stool softener and it's still happening which is freaking me out.The following could be unrelated, but I have had 6 episodes of passing out in the past year with no prior history. I have also lost 75 lbs in almost two years. I've made a semi-conscious effort to be healthier, so I haven't really been concerned about it until now. However, this past semester I definitely haven't been trying as hard, but I've still been losing weight.Has anyone experiences symptoms like this before?? Literally any answers are appreciated- even just words of comfort. Thanks!"

I only mention this because I have been told it could be a chill.Yesterday I got out of bed and felt really dizzy, had to crawl to the kitchen and drink some water. There were stars before my eyes and at one point I thought I would collapse. I put this down to lack of fluids. I had had a sore head the night before. So yesterday I drank lots of water and had a rest. But I had a headache and when I coughed it was more painful. I had a slight pain when taking a deep breaths well.This morning I felt ok but was very drowsy and could not get out of bed when I was supposed to. I still have a muggy head and when I cough it is sore. And when I bend over it is sore. I blew my nose and blood came out.I did feel a little nauseous yesterday, and today it is not too bad.Yesterday I had burning pee but today it is ok.The pain is at the front of the head.I am wondering if this is cancer. I don't often get headaches and they are not that bad. Usually they get better with drinking more or putting glasses on, but this didn't work yesterday. This is the first time I have had this, and very occasionally in the past coughing have given me a sore head.Any advice is welcome.Thank you."
"Cancer","Pet Scan experience","Hello,Just want to hear what was protocol with your pet scan.On Friday I had a head and neck pet ct to hopefully rule out cancer.My doctor reluctantly ordered it and the imaging facility was equally hesitant when scheduling.My questions didn't surface until looking back on how everything went.First off I thought they were supposed to check my blood sugar which they did not. When I was given the injection it looked to be a regular syringe (no special markings of hazordous as I might expect) and right into my arm, not a tube as I had read prior.Walking to the test the technologist asked if I were wearing any necklaces? I said no but I did have in earrings of which she said was fine to leave them in. Everything I read says to remove.Getting placed for the scan she had me put my hands over my head. Looking after the fact shouldn't they have been at my sides to get the clearest view? Also I thought it was weird that I couldn't hear the machine at all. Not even a hum.As I was leaving there were no instructions like drink plenty of water, etc.And when my husband gave our credit card to pay they came back and said it couldn't be processed that we would be mailed a receipt later.This just feels really strange over all. Maybe this is how it goes and I'm just overly paranoid.Any advice in how yours went would be highly appreciated!Thank you so much!"

"Cancer","Temporal arteritis or tumour","Hi everyone.I did a post last week explaining that for the last 4 week's I keep getting a weird feeling in my head everyday that I can't explain, its not painful but basically I can't concentrate or focus on anything when it happens and everything that's not in my direct eye line I find too 'noisy', I explained this can last anywhere from an hour to a few hours each time.I saw the Dr last Friday and all my blood tests came back fine and he was confident it wasn't a tumour as no warning makers showed in my bloods. He is treating me for chronicle sinusitis which I don't believe it is as I have no sinus symptoms and I am not in pain. If he 3 weeks it's no better then he said he would refer me for a scan.However, yesterday I started with a pain in my left temple, not constant, only when I touch it, the pain spreads about an inch all around the area I touch. And today the pain is sharper but again only there when i touch it or when I bend down.I have looked at Google and I am worried it's temporal arteritis which I have read can be fatal.also I have nice my arms have been achy tonight aswell.My Drs it takes ages to get an appointment and I don't wanna go a&e just for a pain that hurts when you touch it but at same time I am really scared it's something really serious and brain related."
"Cancer","Scared i have a brain tumour","Hi EveryoneThis is a long message and I apologise but I feel like I am going out my mind and I am scared I have a brain tumour.It all started a few weeks ago after a heavy night out drinking in town and the next day I felt rubbish and dizzy and where as must people would put it down to a hangover or the effects of booze, I convinced myself that I had kidney or liver failure as i never get hangovers. And then on the Monday it continued and my symptoms have got worse and basically that was 4 weeks ago now.The main symptom is an awful feeling/sensation in my head, it's so hard to describe but basically it's not dizziness but maybe you could call it light headed and it feels like I have pressure moving around my head, especially near my eyes. It happens several times a day, sometimes for an hour, other times it feels like it's nearly all day, when it happens I can't concentrate or focus on things, I spend all day on a laptop at work and I find myself pressing the wrong keys sometimes.Also it feels like everything around me is too 'busy' and unless it's in my direct line of vision and close to me then I can't concentrate or focus on it. A good example of this is driving, when it happens whilst I drive it feels like everything outside of the windscreen is just too much for me, I don't know if it feels too bright or too much movement but I have to look at the centre of my steering wheel or something close to me in the car to feel okay.For the first 2 weeks I was convinced I had liver or kidney issues but then this head sensation of pressure/light head - if you can even describe it as that - has got worse and now i think it could be a brain tumour and I am really scared.I thought i had a brain tumour at the start of the year cos I had a twitching eye for months that won't go away and my Dr referred me to hospital to see a specialist who said he was confident I didn't have a tumour but he never gave me a scan and now i am thinking he may have missed it. I also know it's not my eyes cos I had an eye test in August and my vision was perfect.I went to the Drs last week and he took my blood pressure which he said was fine and he sent me to have all my bloods done to test for everything. I go back tomorrow for the results but I am really scared. Will a blood test even show signs of a tumour? and say they come back fine, then what?? I know there's something defiantly up because why else would I be getting this weird head feeling/sensation every day?!It's driving me crazy!I could cope if it happened for like 5mins a day but this is nearly all day everyday.The only time it seems to ease a little is weekends and if I am playing ps4 but even then I still get it but it may only be half the day rather then all day.Has anyone any advice at all as I feel like I am going mad! I can't even remember what it feels like to feel normal anymore.My family and friends don't understand as they think it's just me being dramatic again but it's not, there really is something strange and not right going on in my head 😦"
"Cancer","I am extremely scared I have Lymphoma ","I am a 21 year old male. In July I developed a low grade fever and a pretty bad headache. I have a brain shunt, so I had some X-rays and CT Scans (X ray of my chest and CT of my brain) which came back clear. More testing revealed a positive EBV / Mono test. It's been four months, and I still have a fever. One of my tonsils is swollen, I feel itchy all over, which from what I read, are signs of lymphoma, I can't find much info saying those correlate with Mono. I saw a hematologist, I had a blood test done called a ""leukemia / lymphoma flow"" which came back clear, but again, from peoples stories on here, most of them had fine blood work. I have no swollen lymph nodes in my neck, and none in my armpit that I can see or feel. I have to go back to my hematologist to possibly get another CT, but that isn't for 2 weeks. I'm hoping it's hypochondria, but of course I've read that Lymphoma can cause a false positive for Mono... All which is stressing me out and leaving me extremely worried. If this is useful info, I've had my blood work done 4 times since I was first diagnosed with Mono, and my lymphocytes have gone down a lot (still elevated) but no where near where they were when I first found out I had mono. Hopefully that's a good sign that it's just mono. I don't have night sweats, I don't have much shortness of breath, I can't feel any swollen nodes in my neck or armpits, but I do have a fever, I am itchy all over, one of my tonsils is a bit enlarged, and I am fatigued."

There's already been a delay in getting it diagnosed as during an original appointment with our GP some time ago he was told it was 'nothing to worry about' but when he went again because it wasnt going away, now he's told it is cancer. I've been trying to contact the hospital to see if we can get the surgery moved forward or get a cancellation but they wont answer their phone and never return voicemails. Just wondering where we go next - who can we speak to, who will listen - this is so terrifying and nobody will speak to us about it. Is there a patient hotline or something we can approach just to get someone to give us some advice on how we can get him seen more urgently, given his cancer history."

"Cancer","Side effects of quitting smoking or actual lung cancer? ","Hello folks. I am 23 year old male, been smoking for over 7 years and can happily say that I am free for 10 days and not planning to go back. As much as I am enjoying cigarette free lifestyle, there are few symptoms that started to happen after giving up and it's driving me crazy.First one is shortness of breath (actually it started over a month ago). When my heart started to race out of nowhere, got chest pain on the left side, which lasted for over an hour, I thought I was going to have a heart attack and called an ambulance. They examined my heart and lungs and said they both were fine. Been worried there was something wrong with my heart, I started to have sensation of being out of breath constantly, it was like I needed to breath very deeply but lungs were not getting enough air. It was like hell for few days before I finally had ECG test and doctor said there was indeed nothing wrong with my heart and it was all caused by anxiety. She anyway listened to my lungs with stethoscope and said they were clean as well. All my answers on her questions were negative as well, like if I coughed extra sputum/blood in the morning, if shortness of breath was caused when I was more active than usual or if I was getting tired easily. When she said that, it was caused by anxiety and by time it would go away, I was super relieved and indeed after about a week to ten days I started to feel so much better that, shortness of breath was almost if not completely gone.About 10 days ago I caught a flue or cold and that's when I decided it was finally time to stop smoking and I did, but few side effects happened during this time. Having chest pain on the right side, not exactly very sharp, not blunt, it's like happening out of nowhere for a min or less and goes away, it is also not bound to an exact spot, it might happen in the center of the right chest or close to the ribs on the right. I sometimes had this feeling if I smoked way too much ( 2 pack +) but the pain was so nonexistant and usually went in a day or two, that I never payed attention to it, up until now, when pain got much sharper, when it happens it feels like there's something in my lungs ( I know that lungs don't have pain receptors though ), and starting to worry there might actually be something wrong with my lungs, shortness of breath started to happen once again. On the good side, during this 10 days, my coughing got much better (I almost don't cough at well), considering that I coughed like maniac in the first days. Sputum, ( not sure if I use that word correctly) from extremely dark green, became very light green to almost white. Everything was going fine, and I thought that chest pain would go away as well at some point, until yesterday, when I coughed blood. It was for the one time and a tiny bit covered in saliva, but the color was extremely dark brown, I was not sure if it was 100% blood, but I coughed it in the morning today as well, for about two or three times, same amount, same color, but now it left kind of irony taste in my mouth and I am super worried it might actually be symptoms of lung cancer. I know, I need my chest x-rayed, but I can't do it until mid of November, until then this feeling of actually might having a cancer will drive me crazy.What I have read of other symptoms, I don't have any. My appetite got better, as did my energy, I don't/did not have fever for almost 3-5 years.Shortness of breath may be explained by anxiety, I've heard that chest pains actually happen after giving up years of smoking ( as a result of lung healing ), but coughed the blood, well fk me, the more I think about it the more anxious I am getting."

"Cancer","Can really use some help ","First off I suffer from very severe health anxiety. With that being said, my wife and family are not taking me very serious with anything anymore.So why I’m posting is within the past 3 weeks I have lost about 10 pounds. I was working out for the last year 6 days a week until I recently hurt my knee. So the last 3 weeks I have not worked out and have eaten terrible. Yet I have dropped 8-10 pounds during this timeframe.My wife says that I have lost all my muscle from not working out and that’s why I weigh less . I have also been very stressed and anxious for the past 3 weeks with me knee issue.Bottom line is, my fear is cancer. I have had some mild night sweats lately but so has my wife so it could be humidity here.I had a CBC about a month ago that was good and a chest CT scan in May that was also good.I don’t know what to think. I had a major panic attack today thinking that it could be cancer.If anyone could shed any advice , expiriences, I could really use it now. I’m terrified and can’t function"
"Cancer","Scared of cancer","I Am really terrified of recent symptoms I have been having. For the last two weeks I have been having mild night sweats. Also I have lost about 5 pounds in two weeks. I was working out pretty hard before these last two weeks and then I hurt my knee. I also went off my diet and haven’t been eating well the last two weeks. So not sure how I would lose weight During these two weeks. I also have seemed to lost muscle mass within the last two weeks. Not sure if it’s from not working out? Maybe the loss of muscle mass caused the weight loss?I also have been having mild night sweats the last two weeks along with headaches.My dr does not seem to concerned. Sometimes I worry he knows I suffer from health anxiety and is chalking it up as that.I did have a normal CBC last month. A chest CT scan and Chest X-ray within the last 6 months. And a stomach and pelvic CT scan about a year ago.I guess what I’m wondering is could cancer have shown up after these tests? I worry these symptoms I’m having are some type of cancer like lymphoma or a tumor somewhere else.Dr thinks weight loss is from my anxiety and night sweats could be from the anti-inflammatory medicine I’m taking for my knee (naproxen)Any advice, help would be helpful. Especially someone that works in medical field.I know this is a long rant 😢 "

"Cancer","Severe Health Anxiety over 1 enlarged Lymph Node. ","Hi, this is my first post, was just looking to get some info as I’m struggling at the moment.Some background information about me, 28 year old male, good health (I assume) doesn’t smoke or drink, eats good and works out. When I was 20 I had a mole removed which turned out to be melanoma, which was a shock at that age, however it was strange as my surgeon said the reason my results took so long to get back (6-8 weeks) was they could not 100% put say it was melanoma, he said if 10 doctors looked at it, 5 would say yes, 5 would say no, but the best option is to treat it as if it was. So I had a wider excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy, both came back clear and I proceeded to have 5 years of check ups. Before this I was never aware of lymph nodes , etc, so during that time I would fiddle and feel around for anything in my body because I was paranoid, of course I found this bump in my neck that I’ve never felt, consistently played with it, Googled it, convinced myself it was cancer, let my mind just take control and didn’t mention it for a good few months just because I was scared. Eventually I did and the doctor said let’s just remove it , so we took it out and I got a letter saying it was just a reactive node, nothing to worry about. Finish my 5 years of checks, brilliant, no health anxiety, feeling good.Fast forward a few months ago, started to convince myself I was having a heart attack / stroke symptoms as I was falling asleep, was a shock to me. Obviously googled things again, heart problems, mini strokes, I convinced myself I had these problems. Went to my docs, checked me over, said I was too young and I was suffering with anxiety/panic attacks, eventually it just went away. Now a few weeks ago, as there was nothing wrong with me, I went for a feel around, right groin, the inguinal node? Felt slightly swollen, oh what’s that? Oh no so Dr Google comes to my rescue again, lymphoma, or a cancer that has spread. For 8 days I did nothing but google, touch, rub this node around 200 times a day, some days it was soft and small, others felt a bit bigger and firmer, it moves under my finger which I read was good. All this time though I’m telling myself I have terminal cancer and I’m going to die, my cancer has come back. Like I wish I couldn’t have these thoughts but they have made my life miserable the last 2 weeks, I went to the docs but had a panic attack the night before over the fear of what was going to be said. I told her everything I’ve wrote on here, She checked my BP, temp, listened to my chest from the front and back and then felt the node. Literally 2/3 seconds and she said it felt normal?! I was like you are joking?! No she said. I couldn’t believe it, was a relief, I asked what signs they look for and she said lymph nodes can go like golf balls? Anyway that was last week, I thought great, let’s move on, but I can’t, for the last 7 days all I’ve done is prod, feel and google again and again, I know it’s not good for me, I’m making myself ill. I’ve had no other symptoms apart from a couple of days ago a bad stomach and some diarrhoea, convinced myself this was my body giving up. I’ve moidered myself that much I’ve booked another doctors appointment to feel this node again?! I was thinking what if the first doc was wrong? She only felt it when I was lieing down, it feels much softer and smaller in that position as to when I’m standing up straight it feels a bit bigger and bit firmer. I’m struggling a lot atm, like I can’t even think about the future because I think I won’t be around sorry for the long post"

I only looked at it properly this monrning and noticed the change in colour then. I am now worried about it as it has not gone away and has gone brown which I’m concerned could mean it is sinister?

"Cancer","I Think I Have Penile Cancer","I’m 18 and for the past year I’ve had a weird growth or bump under my foreskin on one side of my penis head. (I don’t exactly know what it is) but it’s really hard. I think It’s made my penile tissue harder except for the foreskin, but my foreskin went through texture changes too. It feels more soft, fragile, oily, and a lot colder than it used to. The problem is I have phimosis and when I developed whatever’s on the side of my penis it made it even harder to retract my foreskin so I can’t see what it is exactly. I’ve tried ointments to loosen my foreskin but it doesn’t work. my foreskin seems very weak, as if it has an infection or something. I personally believe I have cancer. It would explain the growth and the changes in my penis. one side looks thicker than the other due to the growth. Also my foreskin never felt as cold nor felt as fragile before the growth and I also sometimes experience numbness in my penis that comes and goes. I can’t think of anything that this could be but cancer. It doesn’t hurt to pee nor am I having any discharge or bleeding though. does anybody he know what this could be?

"Cancer","Help needed on Subungual Melanoma","Remembering that I had some emery paper in the drawer I stupidly proceeded to try to ‘sand down’ the poorly nail, to try to remove the mark, which, if I could only clear it would surely prove that the line was near or on the surface of the nail and not somewhere under it (ie Subungual) as I thought the term to mean.Very sadly, the emery paper didn’t work very well at all, and so, in a further panic, I tried to cut the nail down again and managed to do so, before I realised what an idiot I had been again in probably removing any evidence that might have helped me whenever I did the right thing and had it properly checked out by my GP.Despite all my repeated stupidity today, I wondered if someone could help me and advise me. The scene that I am left with on my toe is of a very badly cut down nail with nothing, ie no dark line, behind it in the skin, nor any further sign of any cancer in the form of any ‘nodules’ that I’ve read might be involved.I realise that I might now have to wait for months whilst my nail grows back again or I can try to pluck up the courage to show my terrible handiwork to my GP. Is there anything I would have seen today that might have been evidence of any cancer, and/or does the absence of any further sign of the disease in my toe go quite a long way to probably saying I’m OK? Part of the reason that I wanted to get under the nail was that I thought ‘Subungual’ meant ‘under the nail’ and so I reasoned that I could just get under there but actually saw nothing, then chances are I was OK.Could anyone offer me any advice or any comfort in all this. I’m so very sorry for being so stupid, but I hope you can understand how very upset and worried I was today, though my stupidity has only made me feel much, much worse nw this evening. "

She mentioned it was just to rule out cancer because it can be common.One mole on my arm has definitely changed shaped completely, almost like it had dispersed in the middle and changed colour.The one on my back has risen more, and almost changed direction like it’s dropping down and is red and irritated and she said it is of more than 1 colour.Both of them can get quite itchy and sometimes the slightest graze of my bra can make it sting.I am just anxious about how common melanoma is?

"Cancer","Large mass in thigh area.","I have just been to the doctors due to the discovery of a large lump near my right inner thigh area... The problem is of course the more I Google the more I'm worried.The doctor has ordered me a Scan in about 3-4 weeks provided the lump/mass doesn't get any larger.He said he isn't worried about it. But I just thought 'well if you are worried your not going to admit it'.. It's a big lump about 3 cm wide and 5 cm long. Google just says Sarcoma. well at least that what this lump presents. Are there any other reasons for such a large lump to come up?."

"Cancer","Brain fog, dizziness, feeling unsteady even while sitting, headaches, weakness ","Last May, I got into a car accident. A very minor one. No damage to my car at all. The guy who hit me was going very fast before hitting me though, as I heard his brakes screeching for about 2 or 3 seconds before being surprised by the impact (I was rear ended). The next month, I was just sitting in my room when all of a sudden I started to feel a weird sensation in my head and neck. My parents called an ambulance and they checked my heart rate and blood pressure and it was just slightly higher than normal due to the panicked state I was in. I decided to not go to the hospital. A couple of months later, the weird sensations intensified, giving me anxiety for the first time in my life. Then came minor dizziness, that almost pulsated (I could feel the dizziness happen somewhere in my body. Almost like a pulse, if that makes sense. The dizziness is very constant today, and I also get weird headaches that last all day or days! I also have light and sound sensitivity, with sometimes having trouble maintaining my balance while walking. While trying to find answers, I got none from any traditional doctors I’ve been to so far. This condition has sent me to the ER many times. I’ve gotten almost all the tests you can get (EKG, blood work, CT scan of my neck and head). Nothing wrong in either of those. The neck scan is the most recent, in January. My neck hurts, so I went to see a muscle/skeletal doctor last week and they said everything is fine in that regard, but that I should see a neurologist. I made an appointment for next week. The only answer I’ve received is from an upper cervicales doctor who said my top vertebrae (atlas) is tilted to the left, and that could be the cause of everything. I received a treatment and it hasn’t done very much (no cracking involved). It’s been almost a year of this and it’s taken over my life. Some days I cannot get out of bed. I’m nervous that it’s a brain tumor or something serious like that. I’ve heard that CT scans are not reliable in terms of finding something in the soft tissue. My head has been pounding with no pain for almost 3 days now. Medicine does nothing for it. Today, I was on the phone with a friend and out of nowhere, everything he said started to echo, and I felt a sense of confusion hit me. As we continued to talk, I struggled to find words and would often pause in between sentences to figure out what word was next. My right leg felt short when I walked, and I felt off balance as well. Someone please help! "

"Cancer","Would a CT Scan Detect Melanoma?","Hello All, I recently have been going through a variety of tests for unrelated things, which included a contrast CT of my neck about a 2 months ago. After this test, I found a small lump at my hairline that is below a mole. I haven't felt it grow, but it is somewhat hard. I am not too sure how long this has been there for and likely could be months (likely before CT). I showed it to my family doctor who is sending me for an ultrasound to characterize it and called it a nodule. This appointment is next Friday but am curious, if this lump was there during my CT, and the mole/lump is melanoma related, would the CT scan have noticed that?"

"Cancer","Cancer On Penis?","Months ago I’ve spotted a bump/growth on the side of my penis,Its under my foreskin so I can’t see it because I have phimosis and whatever it is made my foreskin tighter on one side. Even if I loosened my foreskin by stretching it’d still be hard to retract because of whatever is underneath it on the side of my head.It seems to cause me micro tears every now and then.One side of my penis head is definitely bigger as if it’s swollen which would be the side with the bump / growth.My penis also feels harder and less sensitive, it kinda feels hollow. My foreskin looks more baggy is more wrinkled than what it was. It’s definitely changedin appearance a bit. Another symptom is my foreskin is more oilyand moist than usual on the outside and under my foreskin I get a tingly/ wet sensation and sometimes my penis feels abnormally cold. When I ejaculate it’s also uncomfortable,It’s like a cold sensation of pressure, that’s the best way I can describe it. No burning during urination though. Sometimes it burns afterwards. Sometimes there’s itching and burning pain in my penis as well. Texture wise, my foreskin can feel abnormally soft or rubbery and sometimes rough while under my foreskin my penis feels quite hard regardless if I’m flaccid or not.My doctors seem to think I just have a phimosis problem so they prescribe me with creams to stretch my foreskin but they don’t realize that the stretching will do nothing with what’s under my foreskin because it prevents me from being able to stretch it. I’m only 17 year and I’ve never had any sexual contactso I know for a fact that this isn’t an STD. I know that cancer of the penis is rare but not impossible, I believe I may have it.I’ve been struggling for a while. If anyone has any suggestions orany ideas of what I could have I’d definitely like to hear your thoughts. "
"Cancer","The Very Beginning of going through the process of whether certain tests may indicate lung cancer ","On 7/12/18 I had an appointment with my internal medicate doctor and told her that I have had the following syptoms: loss of weight over the past 6 months, excessive over fatique. I am 70 yrs old and have been smoking almost consistently since my college days. My doctor immediately ordered that I get blood work, a chest x-ray, and to make an appointment at the hospital for a CT lung cat scan. She blurts out the words lung cancer as it is her primary assumptions based upon the facts as given her. She in no way try to surgar coat her statements, nor does she even try to comfort me that it is not a done deal at that point. I called her office this morning in an attempt to get the results for the blood test as well as the chest x-ray, but was told that although the results of the tests have come back, my doctor hasn't had the opportunity to review the results, and when she has (probably over the weekend) I will be notified of those results. In the meantime, I am very concerned and anxious. I will not call the Hospital to make an appointment for a CT lung cat scan at this point until I hear that that additional step is necessary in light of the positive results of the other two tests. The manner in which my doctor was mentioning ""lung cancer"" without any medical evidence to support any such conclusion was very upsetting to me. The docior didn't try to give me any support or comfort for her preiimonary guesses, and/or statement to the affect that it is also possibly that my medical situation might be something other than lung cancer.. This is one doctor that needs to learn a little more compassion and empathy for her patients and not to purposely try to scare the heck out of them from the very start! Needless to say the past four days have nerveracking for me because I seem to be only expecting the worst scenerios. I still refuse to call and make the appointment yet for the CT lung scan until I know for sure it is required to be done based on what was seen on the chest exrays and/or blood work. I'm trying to think as logically as possibly under the circumstances. Doctors are excited by ordering all these tests, but never seem to have the time to actually talk to their patient to let them know what is going on and what they may expect in the various steps of the process - whether good or bad.

"Cancer","Melanoma - dark smudge on foot sole was acral lentiginous melanoma","Just for info: if you notice a dark smudge/spot on the sole of your foot, do get it checked out. I had been aware of it since July 2013 - it looked it bit like when you have walked in some tar on the beach and can't wash it off. It didn't look like a malicious mole at all, so it never occurred to me to get it checked out. I happen to be in a dermatology clinic in the Churchill Hospital in Oxford for something else and they thought it looked suspicious. I had an ellipse biopsy on 19 May 2015 (it's on the ball of my left foot - a most awkward place, leaving me quite incapacitated). My husband managed to get me crutches from AgeUK, I couldn't have done without them. Two weeks later the histology report confirmed it was acral lentiginous melanoma, fortunately still 'in situ', so stage T0, I count myself very lucky, had feared much worse since I'd had it for two years. I had it excised there and then on the same day 2 June 2015, leaving a wound 3mm deep the size of a 10p piece. There were no stitches, it had to heal by itself (secondary intention healing). I suffered a very frightening bleed the night after the op when I went to the loo at 5am - I noticed a pool of blood on the carpet below my foot! Eek! The district nurse came and redressed the wound. Convalescence took a long time - I was on the sofa with foot elevated above heart level for what seemed endless weeks. The histology report of the excised tissue indicated there were still atypical cells in the margins, so further surgery was required by the plastic/reconstructive surgeons team at Oxford: another 5mm margin all round and a skin graft from my groin area, which was done 8 weeks after the first excision, just as the wound was nearly healed. This was done on 22 July 2015 - five days ago. This time I have slept on my back on our sofa (which has an electric foot rest) - I didn't want to risk another bleed, no danger of knocking my bandage on the bed clothes as you turn over in bed so that hopefully the skin graft didn't move or come loose. My foot wound has been very painful as after the first operation, especially in the first few days - paracetemol didn't quite touch it, but it is getting much better now. It hurst especially when my foot hangs down, so I am keeping it elevated all the time, even trying to keep it horizontal as I go to the loo, rolling along on an old typist chair, just picture the scene! Can't have a bath because of groin wound (hardly any discomfort at all - beautifully sewn up by the plastic surgeon) nor a shower because I mustn't get my foot wet. Going back in two days' time to have my very thick bandage removed to see if the skin graft has taken, so keeping my fingers crossed. Then a week or so later will have another appointment with the plastic surgeon for histology results. They say walking functionality should return to normal, but the graft area will be slightly lower than the surrounding area of the foot (as some fat has been removed). So I count myself very lucky indeed it just happened to be found accidentally in time."
"Cancer","Painful swollen lymph nodes in every region for almost a month","I had my baby 7 weeks ai and the day i got home I noticed a lump in my right arm pit. I went to the Dr two weeks later and my obgyn looked and said it might be lymph node or just a bump from where I shave (although it is very much under the skin). So I waited it out and not more than two weeks later the entire armpit up my arm and down my breast swelled up and than my lymph nodes behind my ears and jaw and neck swelled up. I also have been super sweaty and a low grade fever of 100 all the time along with several joint pain. So I went to urgent Care who tested me for step, came back negative (never had a sore throat through any of this), but treated it with a antibiotic for strep anyways? Didn't get better that week, actually got worse and swollen lymph nodes in my chest which are super Painful and hurt into my arm and swollen in my groan and behind my knees along with fever spiking to 103 frequently. Went back to obgyn said it's a viral infection ?! (At this point the original bump has been there a month). Wasn't happy with this so went to the ER , blood work was good they said my urine had some blood cells in it so treated it as a UTI , even though I've had no symptoms of this and I am still occasionally spotting blood since having baby so this could easily be false. Followed up with my primary DR who ran blood work all came back good except for whatever determines inflammation was elevated, I was treated for Lyme's a few years back so she was thinking maybe it's that and started a round of doxycycline.(which would also treat a UTI if it was that) Been on it for a week and if anything I feel worse. Still super sweaty, low grade fever, still all this swelling in my lymph nodes and pain everywhere. Now my kidneys are aching and I'm super nauseous with diarrhea (might be from the antibiotic?) She also wants me to get a ultra sound and possible biopsy of the original node, but it's been a week and they haven't even made the appt. Yet. So 4 drs in and almost two months later and no anawer. I am so stressed and in pain now with my back aching (thinking it's kidney pain). I can't even hold my newborn and with lymph nodes so swollen behind the knees it hurts to walk. No one has any idea what is wrong and I feel like they keep brushing me off. I don't know what to do at this point , I'm curious if this could be cancer? Or some type of autoimmune disorder?I had my baby 7 weeks ai and the day i got home I noticed a lump in my right arm pit.

So I waited it out and not more than two weeks later the entire armpit up my arm and down my breast swelled up and than my lymph nodes behind my ears and jaw and neck swelled up. I also have been super sweaty and a low grade fever of 100 all the time along with several joint pain. So I went to urgent Care who tested me for step, came back negative (never had a sore throat through any of this), but treated it with a antibiotic for strep anyways? Didn't get better that week, actually got worse and swollen lymph nodes in my chest which are super Painful and hurt into my arm and swollen in my groan and behind my knees along with fever spiking to 103 frequently. Went back to obgyn said it's a viral infection ?! (At this point the original bump has been there a month). Wasn't happy with this so went to the ER , blood work was good they said my urine had some blood cells in it so treated it as a UTI , even though I've had no symptoms of this and I am still occasionally spotting blood since having baby so this could easily be false. Followed up with my primary DR who ran blood work all came back good except for whatever determines inflammation was elevated, I was treated for Lyme's a few years back so she was thinking maybe it's that and started a round of doxycycline.(which would also treat a UTI if it was that) Been on it for a week and if anything I feel worse. Still super sweaty, low grade fever, still all this swelling in my lymph nodes and pain everywhere. Now my kidneys are aching and I'm super nauseous with diarrhea (might be from the antibiotic?) She also wants me to get a ultra sound and possible biopsy of the original node, but it's been a week and they haven't even made the appt. Yet. So 4 drs in and almost two months later and no anawer. I am so stressed and in pain now with my back aching (thinking it's kidney pain). I can't even hold my newborn and with lymph nodes so swollen behind the knees it hurts to walk. No one has any idea what is wrong and I feel like they keep brushing me off. I don't know what to do at this point , I'm curious if this could be cancer? Or some type of autoimmune disorder?"
"Cancer","Symptoms of Tumor Becoming Active Again","Hi. I was diagnosed with an optic glioma when I was 3 months old, but it has been stable since I was 3 and a half. Now I’m 18 and have been experiencing some concerning symptoms including: nausea amp vomiting, dizzy spells and changes in my menstrual cycle. I have had some hormonal changes since starting and stopping the pill but this seems like more than simply hormonal fluctuations. Any advice would be much appreciated."
"Cancer","Can a freckle/mole grow back a different shape?","I had a freckle/mole under my arm and one on my arm that I picked off. Both scarred over and the freckles have since grown back, except not the same shape. They grew back a weird shape but still small and the same colour. The one on my arm was one raised mole and is now two small, pale freckles. Is this normal and has anyone else had this?Because they grew back strangely shaped I’m terrified it’s skin cancer!I know I was so stupid to pick it off and wouldn’t do it again (it took a lot of work and was painful— DONT do it!)

So I went in to my doctor. They did a urinalysis. The test showed I had blood in my urine (3-10hpf) They recommended I see a urologist. I went to the urologist. They did another urinalysis. A digital rectal exam. A PSA blood draw. A CT scan of my abdominal and pelvic area. Plus they did a cystoscopy. They said everything was normal and no reason found for the blood. I could be someone who just bleeds every so often. I was ok for awhile with their answers. Then doubt crept in an I started running to the doctor for everything. The urologist did find fatty liver and tiny gallstones. In the past year I've had two ct scans of my head. Several chest xrays, numerous blood draws (all normal) A year follow up with the urologist. My PSA was even lower this year and rectal exam normal. My normal doctor put me on effexor xr . With the highest dose being 150mg daily. They think I suffered from depression and anxiety. Especially considering my health. I run to them thinking I have cancer somewhere, that they have missed. Do you think they are right? Do you think they have done enough to rule out cancer? That it's all in my head? I've also been having insomnia. Could that be the effexor? My current doctor is weaning me off the effexor. Do you know a good way to wean off of it? Thanks ahead of time for your answer. "
"Cancer","Penile Cancer?","This is embarrassing and hard to talk about but I suspect that I have penile cancer. There’s been some changes in my penis which is why I suspect cancer. First of all, my penis feels a lot harder. It’s like the tissue is hard or something. Secondly, my foreskin seems to be thinner but also softer. My foreskin feels different, it gets really oily and soft and smells bad. It gets softer than normal but it also gets rough. My foreskin sometimes stings and burns but isn’t red. My penis also feels cold and feels like there’s pressure and it’s somewhat bigger on one side. The last symptom is pain / discomfort during ejaculation though I’m fine peeing. Idk if this could be cancer or not but I have a doctors appointment in a week. "

"Cancer","Could I have cancer?","I was wondering if it’s possible that I have penile cancer. For the past few months my penis has felt harder than usual, likeabnormally hard. It feels like a rock or something and not just when erect. It’s like that even in flaccid state too. It wasn’t always like that. It’s like the tissue or whatever somehow hardened. My penis also feels less sensitive and my forskin feels tighter and rough. Another symptom is that it sometimes hurts during ejaculation. It will sometimes sting and burn afterwards. It doesn’t hurt to pee though. I’m only 17 and I’ve never had sex so I know that this isn’t due to an STD. I don’t know what this is but it’s been bothersome. Anyone know what this might be? "

"Cancer","Possible Penile Cancer?"," For the past week I’ve been having troubles. I have lower abdomen pain before and after a bowel movement and my stomach feels bloated. Sometimes I’ll feel like I have to go but I can’t. My stool is sometimes hard but sometimes normal at the same time. I’m able to have at least one or two bowel movements a day but I still feel constipated. Also before and after going I’ve been getting sick or feeling sick because I’ve had a fever and I feel like I have to puke and I get really sweaty. My body will either feel really hot or really cold but my penis has for some reason felt cold whenever this sickness kicks in. The symptoms come and go. It’s like a weird sickness that doesn’t stay away for good. There are parts of my day where I’ll be okay and then the next I feel sick. Another thing is (I don’t know if this is contributing to my symptoms or not but I guess it’s a possibility) about 5 months ago I spotted an indent on the right side of my penis. I don’t know why but it’s a bit bigger on that side, like kind of thicker and I sometimes feel pressure on my penis. It hasn’t changed in the last five months so I didn’t feel the need to go in and see a doctor or a urologist but lately my penis will sometimes feel cold and some kind of pressure at the same time. I also had a painful orgasm that was unpleasant, it felt cold and there was pressure. I don’t really know how to describe it other than that. There was no blood or anything. It doesn’t hurt when I pee though, the only urinary symptom is frequent urination when my symptoms act up. Other than that, I pee about every five hours but when symptoms act up I pee every 30 minutes to an hour. I don’t know if I have some kind of prostate infection or penile cancer or anything like that but I’m afraid my symptoms are serious and I’m scared to see a doctor but I feel like I’ve reached a point where I need to. Based on my symptoms, does anyone know what I could be experiencing? Any reply would be appreciated. Sorry that my symptoms are all over the place. (btw I just turned 18 and I’ve never had any sexual contact so I know I don’t have any STDs)"
"Cancer","MRI - blood vessels in brain","Hello all.I couldn’t find a better place to post this, but here it is.... I had an MRI last week do to short term memory loss. I’m always misplacing my keys and phone. I had to resign from my job because of the memory loss. There was no trauma to the brain. I am female, 50 years old. My grandmother on my moms side had Alzheimer’s.My general practitioner (he ordered the test) is out of the office. One of his staff called me to tell me the results. They said there was no tumor or signs of stroke. BUT they said there was difference in blood vessels in my brain. They are having me do blood work.When I search for the cause I keep getting results that say brain hemorrhage or stroke. But they said there was no stroke.I know no one can diagnose me and I’m not asking for anyone to do so. Just wondering if anyone out there may have heard of something like this before.Thanks"

"Cancer","Numb Patch of Skin in middle of back","Hello, I have a small patch of skin (1-2 inches in diameter, oblong shape) in the middle of my back, a little left of center. It is numb and feels dry relative to the surrounding skin (although this could be the numbness I am feeling). It is also very slightly discolored: a little more red/brown/colored than the surrounding skin. I have had it for half a year or so, and as far as I can tell, it has not changed. I am 19 years old. From what I've seen online, it seems very similar to ""notalgia paresthetica"" although for me there is no itching, and that seems to be the distinctive symptom with that (although it isn't very clear whether you can have notalgia paresthetica without itching online). If it is just that, I am fine with getting a steroid cream or even doing nothing. However, I am concerned about melanoma, as I know skin cancer sometimes doesn't always look like what the ABCDE acronym indicates. So: are my symptoms consistent with nolagia paresthetica, or is this something i should be concerned with? Thanks"

Like its hard to explain but I'm having a hard time thinking about my feelings. They're either agressive and angry or sad and morbid.4. My ears and jaw keep popping.5. I'm having issues with feeling detached. Like kinda disoriented and clumsy.6. There is a weird pressure on The left side of my head. It sounds stupid but it feels like something is inside of my head. The feeling starts in front of my ear and ends right behind my eye. 7. The back of my head keeps going numb. Like it feels like its fallen asleep.8. I'm always tired...

"Cancer","Can long-term swollen lymph nodes be normal?","Hey,I’m a 17y/o girl and I’ve had a few swollen lymph nodes in my neck since September. Initially, I freaked out a lot. I have HA, so any little thing kind of sends me into a panic. I googled relentlessly for a couple weeks, but then I got so stressed with school that I actually kind of forgot about them. About three months ago I ‘re-discovered’ them. There’s one that’s maybe half an inch and then like three or four more that are smaller. They don’t hurt, they move around, and they don’t get bigger. They’re just not changing and I feel like if they were a reaction to an infection or something they should be long gone. As I keep pressing around in my neck, I keep finding more and more little ‘bumps.’ I’ve pressed around my neck so much that I’ve actually got some bruises. I tend to press really hard and quite obsessively because they’re freaking me out and I don’t know what else to do. I’m not ready to go to a doctor, but I’ve somehow convinced myself that they have to be cancerous. I don’t have any other symptoms, just a few swollen lymph nodes for the past 9 months. Should I be worried and should I do something, or do I have to chill out and remind myself that I have somewhat bad HA and it’s so unlikely to be anything serious? Any advice?Thanks in advance "

I'm 30, female, Hypthyroid (medicated), PCOS, don't drink, never smoked, sedentary lifestyle (work at home) and suffer with anxiety and depression.I had a bad bacterial infection and flu back at the beginning of March, and before that a viral infection that came out in a rash on my arms, chest and abdomen.Past few weeks, I've had a sore aching left shoulder blade that goes up the side too, and sometimes, I get a tenderness in the ribs below my left shoulder blade. I've seen the doctors, who have said it is muscle related, something to do with the scapula etc. I had a blood test back in December to check for pancreatitis, normal. I get regular blood tests for my underactive thyroid.In the last 5 months, I've had 3 ECG's because I've had such horrendous panic attacks, because I felt like my chest was tight, breathless or short of breath etc. ECG was fine, but my doctor got me an appointment for a 24hr heart monitor. I also had like acid reflux or indigestion for a while, made me feel like my upper chest was tight and full of air, so I belch an awful lot. It eases down now and then. Few months ago, I had a blood test for pancreatitis, that came back normal. I've had physical examinations by the doctors too, they have used Oximeters as well, my oxygen levels are usually normal, as is my heart rate.I was at the doctors 3 times this week, because I've been bursting out crying, panicking and feeling hysterical. They checked me over, 2 days ago, my doctor did another ECG, which was fine again, as was the Oximeter and my lungs and chest he said. Today I went to my doctor again, as yesterday, my right leg went heavy and weak, and I panicked, burst into tears and thought it was Guillain Burres Syndrome. OVER the last week, I've got a rash on the back of my neck, very pale, but itchy, showed my doctor last week, he said it could be ezcema, which I had when I was a teenager behind my knees. WHAT IF IT'S NOT???She examined me today, did that tool thing to your knees where they hit it with a small instrument, my knee went straight forward from the sensation. I also discussed not having periods for 3 months, but had a scan last year which showed PCOS, she said that if it was Ovarian cancer like I was worried about, the scan would have showed something, and women with PCOS have missed periods, and with my extreme high anxiety and stress, is a likely cause too.The leg is better today, but last few days, my left should blade has been aching and very tender, not to touch or anything like, but sometimes it can feel achy when you touch around that area. It comes and goes, some days I won't get anything, just a bit of cracking or popping in the shoulder blade, other days it can flare up, and be aching and in the back left ribs as well, just feels uncomfortable.Then I worry about my shoulder blade and rib aching and tenderness, and all the other things I've gotten, like indigestion, like food/acidy comes up sometimes, not often but sometimes.Or I get really upset if I get a bit itchy somewhere on my body, as that is always a sign of cancer. My pee is clear to a light yellow, So many things I get upset by, I've been to the doctor 3 times this week, and am now on my 2nd day of Propranolol 80mg. Feel a little lightheaded, sometimes short of breath but could be me panicking because my heart rate is slower.I feel like I'm going mad!? It's so exhausting constantly thinking about all these things. I live in constant fear of this, cancers and stuff, and the doctors missing something. I'm exhausted and drained by it, I sit in bed most of the day now, beside getting up to do a few chores, I barely go out anymore either, I start getting panicky and my symptoms FLARE up, so I stay in bed.

It feels like it needs to be stretched or cracked but never does. Pain comes and goes and sometimes feels like maybe it’s stress bottle up in that area but not the norm for me. Of course I made the mistake that of googling my issues and lung cancer pops up as a concern given the symptoms but not sure what that kind of back pain would be like. Mine is dull and never wakes me up or startled me or anything but is more like a nagging pain that comes and goes. Wondering if anyone has experience in this area and a inam not sure if I should go back for further investigating?"
"Cancer","20 year ild","I had severe constipation for about 2 months as well as rectal bleeding, and severe nausea and abdominal cramps. I had a series of investigations done, such as a colonoscopy (which was failed as they could not get round my bowel) as well as a CT scan and a MRI of my pelvis. They couldn’t see anything in the scans so the gastroenterologist labelled it as endometriosis and referred me to a gynaecologist. I am losing weight, I have lost my appetite and the nausea and abdominal pains are persistent. I’m so confused as it feels like there is something really serious wrong with me but nothing showed up on the Scans? Does anyone have any opinions as to what it could be? "

He was a smoker, I gave up in 1990 having smoked briefly from age 16-20.I am loath to go to my Doctors again and ask for a CT Scan just to clear my mind, as I feel I will be wasting his time?Am I worrying unnecessarily due to what happened to my father, or shall I just put my mind at rest?I have no other symptoms, but the worry is constant.I am sorry to bring this up on here, but really concerned, and do not know what could be causing the nagging ache and the need to clear my throat constantly."

"Cancer","Enlarged lymph nodes along the stomach wall: can this be anything other than cancer?","Okay, so. 23 year old male here. My mother passed away in February, she died in diffuse gastric cancer weeks after being diagnosed. Knowing that hereditary diffuse gastric cancer exists and often occurs in young adults I immediately started fearing for my own life. A few days after her death I started experiencing a lot of gastrointestinal symptoms - belching and hiccups for two days, constant mild diarrhoea and barely noticeable upper abdominal discomfort since then, and occasionally bloating and indigestion. Here's what terrifies me the most: I had a CT scan this Monday which showed two enlarged lymph nodes (short axial diameter of 12-14 mm) in the upper abdomen, in the region of the celiac trunk, along the small curvature of the stomach. Back in December my mother's CT scan also showed multiple enlarged lymph nodes in her upper abdomen, the largest one also being along the small curvature of the stomach (22×14 mm). I am yet to talk to my gastroenterologist about the results, but I find this hard to dismiss as sheer coincidence. Can this still possibly be anything other than cancer? Knowing how hard it is to diagnose diffuse gastric cancer I could very well end up going too far before getting an actual diagnosis even though I know what we should be looking for.

"Cancer","Anyone ever exaggerate symptoms to get urgent scans in A&E?","Before anyone comments with why this is a bad thing - I already understand the pro's and cons. If everyone did it, the NHS would be screwed, thankfully - not everyone does, so I will. The toss up between wasting NHS time and giving myself peace of mind is an easy decision to make for me - I care FAR more about my own health than the NHS's time.Just wondering if anyone here has ever exaggerated symptoms of pain at A&E to get scans done more urgently? I've been having some bad abdominal pains, indigestion after every meal, a gnawing stomach pain, bloating and a change in toilet habits for about 6 months as well as a number of swollen lymph nodes. I'm seriously considering going to the doctors, pretending to have exruciating pain so that they will scan me for abnormalities. Kinda worried about Pancreatic cancer and since it's known as the 'silent killer' - I can easily justify a small lie to myself.Anyone else has success with this? "

My lump has not get ever so slightly bigger, it aches more and sometimes makes my arm and hands go numb ( as if I could have been laying on it for a while, that kind of numbness) so I have my ultra sound scan today and Basically the man said the good news is we can't find anything and bad news is means we can't give you diagnosis. He said I don't doubt there is a lump there ( he got me to point it and he just used scanner probe) but he then said you'll probably find your symptoms will go now you know there's nothing there (id already told him about it getting bigger, aching and my arm hands numb). He said it could be scarring or lipoma. So he's guessed what it could be, told me my symptoms are in my head and then said we will give you a follow up appt in 3 months ?? I don't know what to do now he's made me doubt everything and feel like a complete Baffoon.

"Cancer","Pea size left supraclavicular node","Hi all,On the 31 of January I noticed a pea sized left supracalvicular lymph node. About 4 days prior to this I was helping my parents move their furnitures around and maybe less than a week before the 31 of January I did some pull-ups which I remember pained my left shoulder in particular. I was also breastfeeding at the time and my daughter would sleep usually on my left collarbone almost the whole night feeding. I remember waking up sore and having numb to needling arm. I went and spoke to my gp without telling her about the details mentioned above as she did not seem very welcoming so it put me off. She did not examin me well and barely touched the node and went on her computer typing. Then she referred me to a full count blood test which came back normal and also referred me to a breast surgery unit which i do not understand why! The clinical pharmacist at the gp on the day examined my breasts and were absolutely lump free. Plus that i do self-examin myself and there is no lumps there that i can notice. I believe if there was any I would be able to feel them. I have cancelled the appointment to the breast syrgery clinic because i do not believe i need it at all. I have no symptoms at all. However, i am very concerned about the node not going away. I have searched the web about it and all posts seem concerning becsuse of its location. I also read that even though the node waxes and weans it may still mean something dangerous. Also stomach cancer shows no symptoms in the beginning. So i am scared and concerned and i feel i cannot go about my days looking after my baby without being very concerned about it, wishing to wake up one day and it’s completely gone back to its original size. So what do you think i should do? Do you think i might have something malignant in the abdomen or elsewhere that made this node show up all of a sudden. What could it possibly be? I also read that full blood count does not necessarily show cancer one might have it and also get normal result. Can i also mention that i also have what i think swollen lymph nodes in the groin which hurt a little when i press or i should say feel a bit uncomfortable. I can only feel them when i kind of press gently on the skin. I checked my toddler and she also has them i spoke to one of my sisters and she said she thinks that’s normal i just seem to have them but again she is not a medical proffesional. But i can feel them on both sides right and left. Is it normal to feel them? Can this be something dangerous? =("

Even though I’m young my symptoms seem to match with various ovarian problems: constant back ache, pain in my abdomen, I’m not eating as much as I usually would, I’m almost always bloated to the point where I look canny pregnant (though I have been told I have IBS). I’ve also noticed in the last few months that sex has become very painful. I’m trying not to think about it too much and just wait until my appointment next week but I can’t help it. Over the last week there’s been a few time’s where I’ve considered going to A&E because the pain has gotten that bad. Has anyone got any advice? Or idea of what the hell could be going on? I really don’t want to be thinking about cancer as I know it’s unlilely at my age... but it’s hitting a bit close. Thank you,Meg"
"Cancer","Is this throat cancer? Completely terrified!","Hello, I hope someone will advise me because I am so scared that I have throat cancer that I can't sleep or perform any of my daily activities anymore, because this is all I think about. I am a 19 year old male.I had an on and off sore throat and hoarseness for many many months, but was a smoker, so didn't think too much about it. However, I quit around two months ago and not long after that the sore throat and hoarseness started again and continue to this day. Furthermore, During the last month I developed difficulty swallowing and difficulty breathing. Not only does food sometimes feels like it sticks to my throat when swallowing, I have difficulty performing the swallowing action itself, even when I only have saliva in my moath. It's as if my muscles are harder to contract or something. The breathing problems feel as if something is blocking the air flow and I need to put extra effort in if I want to take a deep breath. Furthermore, my chest often hurts when I swallow. During the past few days, I developed this constant urge to clear my throat, but it is impossible to do so no matter how much I try. It's as if something is stuck there.I have been told I have acid reflux before. I saw 2 GPs about this problem in the last weeks and both of them didn't even bother to look at me after learning that I have a history of acid reflux, they just gave me some omeprozol and told me not to come back for a month.The symptoms seem far too severe for a simple thing like acid reflux, especially since I have been living with it for a few years and never had anything this bad. I have found online that these symptoms are consistent with throat ir esophagus cancers and now am in absolute panic mode. I cannot sleep or focus on anything else but the thoughts of cancer and dying.Therefore, I have the following questions:Is it possible that acid reflux would cause symptoms so severe?How likely is it to be cancer?What else could be causing this?And finally, how fast are these types if cancer? How risky is it to wait the month for an appointment? Because all I can think about is how the cancer is growing and spreading and how it will be to late by the time anyone actually tests me."
"Cancer","Swollen lymph nodes ","Hello, kinda concerned and could you some advice and wisdom. I’m a 16 yr old male and recently I had a sore throat that wouldn’t go away, I then decided to take anti biotics last Thursday and after only 2 doses the soreness had gone. However I started feeelingn round my neck to see if my glands were swollen and I felt this bump the size of a pea below my jaw on my neck. This is the concerning part, I’m pretty sure it’s a lymph node and it’s painless, hard to move and hard to the touch. Everywhere I search about this says that it can be cancer but I need some advice or maybe some input in the matter on what to do. I was thinking to wait it out a week to see if it goes. I’m still on my antibiotics as I need to finish the course. Essentially I’m worried and unsure of what to do. Any input is a gift, thanks "

I went to the doctor 8 months ago, had clean blood draws, she checked the node, didn't seem very interested in it and told me to come back in 6 months for a biopsy if it's still swollen. I don't have allergies that I know of, I'm a male, I don't do drugs, I do drink, but I've read to only drench sweat strictly when you sleep isn't a symptom of any kind of detox.Any thoughts? "

"Cancer","23, worried I might have endometrial or ovarian cancer.","Hello, I’m a 23 year old woman. I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 17, and had surgery to remove a 13 pound cyst in my right ovary when I was 18. I’ve always had irregular periods so I was put on birth control to make me regular. It worked on and off for a few years up until last March, ever since then, I haven’t had a single period. In July, I went to to the doctor with terrible abdomal pain and cramping, but I was assigned a nurse practitioner. I was told that I had a thick endometrium, and had a biopsy done the same day. It took three different times because she couldn’t collect any tissue, she said she didn’t collect a lot but that the amount that she did collect would do. Fast forward to a week later I had a transvaginal ultrasound and a CT scan a day after that. After that, I was told that the biopsy results were normal, but that I have a tumor in my uterus and a cyst on my right ovary, again.. I know that they said my biopsy results were normal, along with the ca125 blood test, but something inside of me tells me that I have some sort of cancer. They tell me that I’m too young for these types of cancers, but honestly.. cancer doesn’t discriminate. They haven’t even mentioned the tumor in my uterus which is another thing that concerns me. They’re more focused on removing the cyst rather than addressing the tumor, which is just beyond me.One of the main reasons that I’m having so much anxiety is because cancer runs on my mothers side of the family, and I also have every single symptom of ovarian cancer, and every symptom of endometrial cancer minus the heavy vaginal bleeding and being post menopausal. I’ve lost 38 in two and a half months because I can’t even eat. I literally went from over eating every single day to eating a few bites of food a day.If anybody here is around the same age and has these types of cancers or is worried about the same thing please reply to this!

"Cancer","Numbness and weakness after brain surgery","Hi all. I found out I had a tumour in my brain on 29 January 2016. It was located on the right, deep in the brain and pressed against the brain stem. I had brain surgery on the 10th of Feb and most of it was removed. A biopsy was done and the results are confusing stating that it could be a lesion caused by a hemorrhage but it cannot be concluded or excluded that it might be a low grade astrocytoma. My symptoms before surgery were memory loss, lack of concentration, fatigue, blurred vision and occasionally my limbs would feel heavy. However now post brain surgery every 3rd to 5th day I would have episodes where my whole body would go weak, I would then start to shake, sometimes have difficulty talking and would struggle to walk. Very scary when it happens and as it affects my whole body and not just the left side, it is also very strange to the neurosurgeon that this is happening to me. Has anyone experienced this or perhaps have any idea what could cause this? Thank you in advance"

My mother is 61 years old, post menopausal and has dealt with endometrial polyps her whole life. She finished treatment for stage 1 breast cancer last November and due to the chemotherapy, she started bleeding again from the polyps but the bleeding always went away after a day or so. About a week ago, she started to bleed and now the bleeding won't stop. She went to the doctor and he sent her for an ultrasound on her uterus today. Her tech said that the only thing he saw on the scans were her uterine lining being quite thick but no polyps or tumors or anything. They sent the scans off to be read by the radiologist and then her doctor and we will not hear anything until Monday. So far her only symptoms has been the bleeding, and back pain from the bleeding. No weight loss or anything else. Could this be uterine cancer? I know ya'll are not doctors so I apologize for sounding pushy but we just go through everything wtih her breast cancer and I guess I just need something to get thru the weekend.

"Cancer","glomus jugulare tumour","Hiit is so great to find this site and read all these other comments as I have never been able to speak to anyone with this condition before. I actually have bi-lateral glomus jugulare tumours. My symptoms the same as everyone else-was 16 when diagnosed, first op (18 hours long) when I was 18 -had to go to Manchester as didnt do in Northern Ireland back then. Tumour mainly took away-brill doctors by the way. By then I already had the deafness, tinnitinis and hoarseness etc which is how tumour was discovered. The first doctor told me I had a cold!! It took a doctor who specialised in epilepsy who admitted me determined to find out what was wrong who discovered it for me. The surgery left me with a half paralysed face and had to get my jaw , cheekbone broken to get at it but was back to work within 6 weeks. They grafted a nerve for my face which between that and the swelling to go down took about 6 months to work properly. It also affected my swallowing but soon learnt to swallow a different way and dont look any different when eating-though can only chew on the right hand side of my face re broken jaw and wasted tounge on that side. Then at 21, had to go back again as had been growing back (14 hour surgery this time). When woke up felt great and no changes to my face etc this time. Didnt get it all out so then went for another surgery again very quickly afterwards which didnt happen as the microscope broke down during surgery!! So the option for me was radiotherapy which I had fifteen years ago. I am now nearly 38. I have never had children as they since discovered the genetic part-my whole family had to do blood tests which went to Holland to help discover the gene, which they now have. I know that if I have a son apparently he wont develop it, but he will carry it and if he had a daughter only, it would develop in her. It came from my dads mum to him then I developed it. My younger sister never developed it. For years I went for six monthly checks, then annual checks, but within the last four years, my left hand side (the one I had all the ops on) has really started to prortude on my neck. I wear my hair long but I am very self conscious about it. The trouble being my right hand side has started to grow as I can now feel it-was always there before but could never feel it on my neck but now can. So feeling scared to be honest. The doctors say medicine has advanced so much since I had my ops that they can operate now if they ever have too (was told after my last op when I was 21 that surgery was not an option anymore because they discovered then that the tumours were also in my lungs) so the aneasthetic was too dangerous. The glomus tumours that spread to my lungs by the way have totally remained steady and never gave me any problems at all.Now the doctors say they can operate if need be but it will only be if they ever have too as is a very dangerous op.I just wish I could do something to stop them growing as I am used to living with my hearing etc. My hoarseness can be fixed-I had a vocal cord surgery repair but the tumour caused my soft palate on one side to stop working but they want to fix that. I run my own business and was married (now split up) but feeling very alone now as they are definately growing and feel scared.Sorry to waffle but so good to find this forum"

"Cancer","Worried and Advice Needed ","Hi,My wife aged 50 has been suffering from blurred vision and floaters since last Wednesday. As she knew the GP would suggest getting her eyes checked out, she visited Specsavers and had their test and they could not find anything. They suggested seeing the doctor next day which she did so.The GP wants her to have blood tests, which have been booked for this Friday, and will refer her to an eye specialist at the hospital. Not sure how long this will take as I have an eye problem and have just received an appt 4 months later.Wrongly or rightly the information is there but when I typed in brain tumour, blurred vision and floaters was there as a main sympton. It could be anything of course, but there is a chance it could be related.She was woken in her sleep a few days before the blurred vision started by a sharp pain in her eye.I am really quite worried that if it is a tumour days are being wasted and it could be sometime before this is diagnosed.A scan now would help my fears, but assume these are booked out weeks months in advance. Is there a way I could speed up a process or pay for a scan if it could get one done quickly.I need some quick advice how best I should take this forward quickly if possible as I fear the clock is ticking against her.Thank you."
"Cancer","post radical nephrectomy ","I had Robotic assisted radical nephrectomy on Nov 1st, 2017. Clear cell carcinoma. Recovery has been a challenge. By Nov 8th, I had a complete physical and mental break down. Not something I have ever dealt with. After 3 days of sobbing, and processing, I came out the other side, well, much better. Guess I had to deal with all the emotions I chose not to deal with prior to surgery. Recovery went much better after this. I went back to work on Dec 15th, which, by the way, was too early. I should have waited until the 1st of the year. I am sure you know us A types. Anyway, Starting around the 3rd week of November, I started to get bouts of nausea that came on sooo fast. Lasted about 15 min. Sometimes I vomited, other times, it went away. Now I have bouts of severe fatigue that come on just as fast, but stay for an hour or so. Then gone. When this happens, I feel so fatigued, I could collapse. Not faint, just collapse. Getting a bit worried, but seems so general that the Doctors will probably dismiss. Any ideas?"

"Cancer","Concerned about ovarian cancer","On Monday I developed explosive wind. By Tuesday I had a constant pain on the lower left abdomen with bloating, more gas and belching. Wednesday it seemed to ease so I didn't go to the GP. Today (Thursday) I feel a lot better though there is still a little wind and a bit of an ache so I don't know whether to get checked out or not.. On Sunday and Monday I had started a New Year diet. Both those days I had a teaspoon of cumin in natural yoghurt which is supposed to help with fat loss. Monday I had an omelette with cheese and spinach filling. Could it simply be a reaction to these foods?Hopefully it is just 'gas' without a sinister cause. But can gas last this long?

"Cancer","Spitting blood","HiI am a 28 year male and have minor gum issues and quite regularly get bleeding while brushing so normally put it down to that. Last night I woke up with a big pain in my right cheek where I had bit it (I do this about once a month also in the same spot) and felt very sick. About 20 mins later I vomited (did eat a lot the night before so may be the cause) and afterwards coughed and bought up quite thick mucas with quite thick red streaks of blood in. I brushed my teeth after quickly (did not go over the gums too much) and no blood come out afterwards. This morning I washed my mouth out with water before brushing and spat up a little blood and could also taste blood within my mouth. Would it make sense that the blood caused could be from where I bit my mouth although I could not taste blood initially and vomited before spitting the blood out when I coughed? Of course I am worried it could be a sign of cancer but considering my age / smoking status / absence of other symptoms and family history it does seem very unlikely Other than this I am in fine physical shape with no family history of cancer. PS I also remembered when I brushed this morning the gum area by where I bit my mouth hurt also Thanks for your help "

"Cancer","Neck/Headache for two weeks? "," I’ve posted before, but this worry is seriously ruining my life and I don’t know where else to turn. About two weeks ago I got hit with a pretty bad cold and headache from the left side of my neck to my ear. I started getting dizzy, my ear felt full, and starting getting muscle twitches. I went to the ER twice. The second time I went I got a CT scan with Contrast and they said everything looked perfectly normal. They weren’t able to see “part of my cerebellum” and when I heard that I flipped out. I went to my GP and he did nothing. I went to urgent care and the doctor did a nurulogical exam and said I was fine. She refused to send me for an MRI because she thinks I have anxiety. I know I have anxiety but these headaches still won’t go away, I’ll get these weird sharp pains in my head that freak me out, and I can barely sleep and eat. My eyes hurt. And I’m constantly thinking about it. Should I insist on an MRI?"

"Cancer","Lymphoma? Cancer from X-Rays? Help! ","Hi all, I'll try to keep this short, but I'm pretty scared. About 2 years ago, I had two spontaneous lung collapses. Doctors don't know why, hut after the second one I had a minimally invasive surgery called a talc pleurodesis, where surgeons rough up your lung with talc and medical gauze so it sticks to the chest wall and doesn't collapse. After this procedure, I had a numb patch on my sternum that itched TERRIBLY when I was regaining feeling. It was an internal itch so nothing could be done. Fast forward two year, I am having an itch and some pain in the SAME spot, but this time the itch is external and WON'T GO AWAY. I thought it was because I used soap with perfume. I also thought it was because I take EXTREMELY hot showers, which I read can mess up your skin pretty bad. I tried taking cooler showers to no avail. I've been using aloe vera gel on the spot to no avail. I've tried so much to stop the itch and nothing is working. Here's where my fear comes in. When I was hospitalized for my collapses and surgery, I had chest xrays taken every morning to ensure my lung was healing properly. I also had two CT scans. I'm afraid I could've developed cancer in this area from all the radiation. Another fear is lymphoma. I foolishly looked up itchy skin and the first thing that pops up is lymphoma. I do have slight itching in other parts of my body (mostly my back) but those itches go away when I scratch . The chest one does for about 2 seconds before it comes back full swing. Rational me says its dry/sensitive skin because the skin on my chest has always been sensitive, but this itch won't go away and that's the thing that's scaring me the most. Has anyone dealt with this before? "
"Cancer","Swollen parotid gland and ear clogged help please!!","Last year around March.. I noticed a knot on the back of my neck where the hairline starts.. I really didn’t pay it any mind until it didn’t go away.. so I looked on the internet and first thing I see is enlarged lymph nodes.. so I started to get scared wondering why this would happen.. so I started to panic, I made a doctors appointment the following week.. and during the week my parotid gland started to swell up on the right side .. so I started to feel that area and I also noticed a lil knot under earth and jaw bone where the swelling was at.. actually the knot is slightly under the swelling .. so I started to panic even more and think cancer!! So I went to doctor they said they think it just allergies and don’t worry unless it gets bigger.. so I went home and thought about and said we’ll what if it does get bigger so I made another appointment.. this time her ordered a cat scan .. and this what it said US NECK SOFT TISSUE ADDITIONAL CLINICAL INFORMATION: Enlarged lymph nodes Technique: Multiple grayscale images were obtained of the neck COMPARISON: None available INTERPRETATION: Adjacent to the right parotid gland there is a 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.1 cm node. Just inferior to the parotid gland there is a 0.5 x 1.5 x 0.3 cm normal appearing lymph node. The right parotid gland measures 2.6 x 1.6 x 3.0 cm.

"Cancer","I have had intermittent swelling and other symptoms and wondered if anyone has had similar?","Hi everyone, I am new to this forum and I am hoping someone can help or offer any advise.In March 2016 I began with extreme tiredness, night sweats, bruising easily, general malise and generally felt like I had been hit by a bus. I then had some blood tests done and all came back fine except a raised IgM at 3.56. I was then referred to a haematologist who stated he was not concerned with the reading and to keep an eye on it. Then 3 months later I ran the bloods again and the IgM was raised but lower than the previous - they therefore said it was decreasing and would be fine.Fast forward to September this year and I noticed a swelling just above my right collarbone. It comes and goes day to day or every couple of days. It is not sore or linked to anything. I also have a swelling in my right armpit which has also been there since September time. They feel squishy and not specifically hard. I still have extreme fatigue and had my bloods done again. My IgM was raised again over 3.5 and my MPV was slightly raised. My ESR was fine so there is no infection.I am due to have an ultrasound on the 19th December and I just wanted to know if anyone had experienced something similar."

I am only getting the use of my shoulder now and am still numb on the right side of my face.I realise I was very sick and maybe thats not an option but after the operation they have you relearning so many things I think an overall physio session is warranted. Exercises to do at home after.I was only 28yrs old when it was discovered and had the honour of being one of the youngest to have this condition in the south pacific.I have had a wonderful relationship with the Nuerosurgeon and ENT specialists that operated on me and now I have moved out of the area I was originally in they have kept an eye on me through outpatient appointments and CT Scans with an ENT specialist where I am now based.Finally I have found I have way more headaches now then I ever did but these are stress related and have figured out a way to relax and enjoy what a blessing this life is.Scary yes but now you move on and I really think you need to trust the people who are looking after you and pray that its all going to be ok cause in the end its their skill and gods grace that gets you through.[i:e1eb0ebba5]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:e1eb0ebba5]"

As i did a few days later, he felt the lump \""oh its just a gland, dont worry about it\"".....well he's the man so i went away and didnt worry about it. It ached sometimes, and i got quite a bit of earache but thought nothing of it. Twelves months down the line and it was still there but the pain was starting to feel like i had been kicked on the throat by a mule!!2003 i went back to my g.p., this time i saw the lady doctor, she felt the lump and said it needed investigating. I was refered to the e.n.t dept where they sent me for a biopsy straight away, they done 2 one after the other because they said they hadnt got enough...of whatever it was they wanted!!Next day i got a phone call asking me to go back as they needed to do a scan on my neck. Alarm bells rang when i saw how many people in white coats where in the room, they done the scan and asked me if they could do another biopsy, here we go again i thought, so i held tight and let them proceed, i nearly went through the ceiling.i made a hasty get, and jokingly said i hoped i didnt have to see them again!!A week or so later i was sent for, they told me that they werent sure what the lump was but it had to come out and that i would have to have surgery,still oblivious to what was to come!I went into hospital on the 12 june 2003, and had my op the next day.....friday the 13th...of all days!!!!During all this going on my dad had been taken into hospital, and up until my op i had been looking after my mum who suffered with dementia, with me going into hospital i had to take my mum to a care home close by my home as she couldnt be left to look after herself. I was discharged on the sunday the 15th....it was fathers day, my husband took me straight to the hospital where my dad was, so i could give him his fathers day card and prezzie. He asked me what the hospital had said about the lump, i said it all went well and nothing to worry about,....he punched the air with his fist and said that he was so pleased it wasnt anything serious.On the 19th june 4 days later......my dad passed away.....i was beside myself....I had to go back to the hospital the day before my dads funeral for the results of what the 'lump' was. Only to hear the words that none of us wants to hear..\""the lump was cancerous\"".... It was adenoid cystic carcinoma ......it meant nothing to me at that time.....(but words i would become very familiar with) .the only thing i thought of was my dad punching the air with delight when i told him my op had gone well!!A good few weeks later not sure of the dates it all seemed a hazy blur at the time i started 6 weeks radiotherapy, in the meantime my mum was still in the care home as it was impossible to go for my treatment and look after her, she couldnt even grasp that my dad had died, she thought he had gone for a pint!!!Funny though she would cup my face in her hands and look at the scar on my neck and look into my face and say\""your going to be alright you know\""....must be one of those 'mum' things that even with dementia you still know when your baby's hurting, but as quick as that lucid moment would come, it was gone again and she was back in her own confused world again.I finaly finished my treatment,things will get back to a bit of normality now i hoped. A month later i got up one morning and couldnt open my jaw, not even to brush my teeth. I was refered to the maxio facial unit where they informed me i had to have the majority of my teeth removed due to the radiotherapy, but i would first of all have to for 10 days hyperbaric treatment before they extacted the teeth and then for another 20 days after the extractions where done, this apparently helps with the healing process as there is no blood supply to the bone to help the gums heal. I went with no teeth for nearly 12 months before i could be fitted with dentures.Six years on and i'm still here, get a lot of pain in the back of my neck/shoulder and arm, but i'm told this is all after affect of the radiotherapy, it is unbearable most days but you learn to live with it.I have asked my consultant how do i know if the adenoid cystic carcinoma may have come back, and he told me you dont, and we dont go looking for it, a pretty scarey thought for me as the patient. I read on the net about people with acc and how they are sent for scans, i have been told there is no point in doing a yearly scan, i would have thought there is every point, even if only to re-asure the patient that it had not returned. I read in the papers everyday something or other about breast cancer awareness, breast cancer fund raising, breast cancer resarch, all manner of celebs promoting breast cancer. What about the 'orphan' cancers that are forgotten about like adenoid cystic carcinoma, and the many other oral cancers. It would seem that those of us who have this battle are the forgotten ones. If my story has gone on a bit(well a lot) i apologise, but i at least for the time it's taken me to write it and the time it's taken you to read it i have made just the smallest bit of awareness of this awful disease and how it's , affect, and its treatment are with the sufferer for ever. And i most whole heartedly hope that one day that orphan cancers are brought to the forefront and are given the same media coverage that other cancer patents are given.Thank you for taking the time to read this, and wish you all well in your fight with the 'little known orphan' god bless.

"Cancer","Lung nodule/spot found. Immedialty said it was cancer ","So my mom has bronchitis with a touch of pneumonia. They did a chest x-ray and saw a spot on her lung. They did a CT scan this morning and called her into the office today and told her she has cancer. Isn’t their more test that need to be done like a biopsy or something before they can just flat out say it’s cancer? They didn’t see any lymp nodes swole or see anything anywhere else. Just the spot on her lung. We’re waiting for them to call now to see what test they want to do next. But can they determine its cancer from just the scan without any other test? And since she has a touch of penumonia and bronchitis could that have something to do with the spot on her lung?Thanks"
"Cancer","Existing mole recently changed colour ","Hi,Quick question....I’ve had a mole/beauty spot on my chest for as long as I can remember (just over 6mm in diameter), but recently realised that it had changed in colour from brown to pink. I also think it may have slightly changed shape (although I may just be thinking that because I’m extremely worried and suffer from anxiety).I saw my gp this morning who didn’t think it was anything really to worry about, but told me to keep an eye on it. I’ve also privately booked to see a dermatologist, but that isn’t for two week.I’m really worried that it may be the start of a melanoma. Has anyone else had this? Does it always mean it’s a skin cancer when a mole changes colour/shape?"

The main concern is how to get food and fluids in his body so that he can build his strength. When he was in hospital he was given a normal diet and he cannot swallow. I feel it is not getting the right treatment. The priority now it to get some nourishment in his body. He has lost 2 stones.

"Cancer","Duodenum Polyp,Gastritis, and Esophagitis. Cancer?","I’ve been having a lot of stomach and bowel discomfort for several years now. Pain after eating near the bottom of my right rib, extreme gas 24/7, internal and external grade III hemorrhoids (I’ve had 3 surgeries to remove thrombosed hemorrhoids), bleeding ulcer near the GE junction of my esophagus 3 years ago that I was admitted to the ER for, excessive bleeding when passing stools (I assume are related to the hemorrhoids and possibly fissions), occasional nausea after eating, fatigue, just an over all “yucky” feeling that I can’t really explain, and I could go on. I had a colonoscopy and a esophagogastroduodenoscopy done today. The colonoscopy came back okay other than the multiple external and internal hemorrhoids that were found. The upper scope found gastritis, esophagitis, and a polyp in the 2nd portion of my duodenum. Biopsies were taken of all three. I feel like my doctor is doing a good job getting to the bottom of whatever is going on. I was just wondering if anyone here has had any experience with these types of symptoms all combined together, whether it was you or a patient of yours that had them, and what it turned out to be. I’m just worried that I may have cancer in a different part of my body that could be causing this: like my liver. I smoked and drank EXCESSIVELY from the time I was 15 to 25, when I quit both. I’m 28 now, and just hoping I didn’t cause irreversible damage in my wilder days. Thanks for any help or opinions!"

"Cancer","radical nephrectomy in 3 weeks!!!!","I am new to this group.. Hoping for some help. My Dr has said I have a mass in my Kidney. Because of the amount of growth in a short time, and the houndsfield units in my 3 phase CT, the Dr says it is a 80% chance it is clear cell carcinoma. He suggests a radical nephrectomy because of the location of the tumor. He say ablation is an option, but may take 2 or 3 treatments over a year or two, and still may not get rid of it. Not an option he suggests. The tumor is in the middle of my kidney. He says a needle biopsy is dangerous in the kidney, because cancer cells can be released and spread. As we get closer to surgery date, Oct 16th, 2017, I am getting quite nervous. What if they take it out and it is not cancer? Then I just had a major organ removed, for what? Is this normal to give a patient a percentage like this, AND still do surgery? Should I insist on a biopsy? If I agree to the surgery, which, I already have, but as I said, I am getting nervous, freaking out, actually, so want to change my mind, but I know that would be an emotional decision. What should I expect in the recovery stage? Any insight you can give will be greatly appreciated. "

Almost like they over focus when looking st phone or TV Woke up this morning with numb fingers completely numb and felt fat that took ten minutes to get feeling back. (Left band only even though I wasnt laying on that side)Arms feeling like they're not mine. Almost confused which is my left and which is my right but yet I can use them fine. Lack of apitite Nausea.

"Cancer","Growing lump on Testicle","Hello, I am new here and have never really posted on any type of health forum before so I apologize in advance if this is not the correct formatting. I am a 29 year old (male) 200lbs, 6'3"". About 4 months ago I found a lump in my left testicle. I was in the urgent care (4 months ago) due to some shattered ribs and brought it up to the E.R. doc and he quickly (5 seconds) ""explored"" down there and said it was probably nothing and issued an Ultrasound but he did not seem worried about it at all. I didn't go to the Ultrasound because I had to leave the next day for a business meeting on the other side of the world and was just looking for quick treatment for my ribs.Now I haven't put too much thought into this because I've been so busy with my business and didn't want to be distracted along with there is zero pain down there, but today I did notice it has grown, maybe ~50-75% increase in size from 4 months ago. Believe it or not it's in an odd place at the base of my testicle so it does take a few seconds to find.I have no family doctor because I'm all over the world constantly and I'm not sure if this is a proper ""emergancy room"" issue. I guess what I am asking is; I have no pain, no other symptoms, how likely would this be testicluar cancer. What are some of those symptoms I should be watching out for and would you go to the emergancy room (E.R.) for this?"

"Cancer","Head pressure, visual disturbances, nausea, headaches","Hello,I'm hoping someone can relate to the symptoms I have been having. I am a 26 year old healthy male who works as a Police officer. At the end of June I was diagnosed and admitted to hospital with Pyelonethritis. I was kept in over the weekend and then released with two weeks worth of Co-amoxiclav three times a day (looked like horse tranquillisers!). For around the last few days of being on the medication I started to get diarrhoea and itchy hands and feet. After finish the course these symptoms disappeared. One week after finishing my medication I was out for dinner and started to feel really light headed and very sick (never actually been sick). Since that evening my symptoms have persisted and gotten worse. I've been to the doctors countless times and only now just getting referred to a neurologist. I'm really scared that I may have a brain tumour. My symptoms are as follows:Head pressure, especially behind my eyes and nose. Intermittent head aches (not splitting by any means, just random pains across my head and in my temples)Nausea (Not actually vomiting)Visual disturbances (Shimmering when I move my eyes left to right or vice versa against a light source, snow effect across vision, and sometimes blurred vision which disappears after I blink a couple of times)Dry eyes that feel scratchy at times. Sometimes but not frequently a ringing in one ear as if my ear has just popped. These symptoms seem to be exacerbated when I am at work/active. I do not have any issues with confusion, memory, mobility etc. I've had full blood tests which came back as all clear (first one had slightly low neutrophil count but second all perfect). I've also had two eye tests which have come back as near perfect vision. I can still see perfectly even when I am experiencing my visual symptoms.The doctors have first said I was recovering from the very nasty infection I had, then they thought labyrinthitis and now they think it might be optic neuritis however my optometrist has stated he very much doubts this as my optic veins etc look perfect in the images that were taken. Can anyone give me some peace of mind or relate to what I am experiencing - I first thought it was a side effect of the antibiotics or the infection but it has been so long now I am not so sure. "

"Cancer","16 months after skin biopsy","Hi,I had a mole removed for biopsy from my left fore arm. Results 2 weeks later were malignant melanoma, thankfully, stage 1.I then had a much deeper and wider area removed which required 16 internal and 16 external stitches.That was March 2016. Now whenever I brush or lean on my left forearm I get a severe burning sensation at the biopsy site. There are no visible surface signs for this, could it simply be nerve damage after biopsy.Mike."
"Cancer","High Lipase Numbers with no symptoms - hyperlipasemia","For over 3 years I had flucatinig lipase numbers ranging from 1-4x over limit. The first was found incidentally while completely asymptomatic. When discovered I was given ultrasound, ct scans with constrast, ca19, colonscopy, celiac test, liver, kindey, cbc, hep, etc and all were fine. I do not drink and do not have a family history of pancreatic cancer.Gastros diagnosed me with benign condition. However 2 years later for reassurance I had MRI on pancrease which again was normal. My gastro and his team tell me not to worry and there is nothing wrong with pancreas.However I read these reports and it looks like I need EUS test is the test I need, which is not common here in USA. My gastro refuses to send me get one because he does not feel it's necessary. Reports below state that my so-called benheing condition is not so benign and pancreatic disease are found over 50% of time with further testing with EUS with people with Asymptomatic Pancreatic Hyperenzymemia. Some days my test are normal and some days they over slighlt over limit or 1x over limit. I have no symptoms whatsover.So far I seen 4 gastros and they all think I have too much anxiety and not to worry but they are unaware of the latest studies. http://www.omicsgroup.org/journals/2165-7092/2165-7092-S1-e001.pdfFamilial pancreatic hyperenzymemia is a benign condition and its pathophysiological mechanism is still unknown. An appropriate clinical and imaging follow-up should be carried out in those patients having this condition associated with familial pancreatic cancer.An elevation in serum pancreatic enzymes in the absence of pancreatic disease is reported in the literature and defined as “benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia” or “Gullo’s syndrome” [7]. This condition can occur sporadically or in a familiar form, it is asymptomatic, and it is generally discovered incidentally. Nobody of the subjects included in this definition had been treated in the past with pancreatotoxic drugs. These authors sustain that at least one year must pass after the initial finding of pancreatic hyperenzymemia before it can be considered benign. Furthermore, they emphasize that a proper diagnosis of this condition is important because it allows the clinician to reassure the subject that this alteration is benign and does not require any kind of therapy. Nevertheless the possibility that these individuals could have an increased risk of pancreatic cancer cannot be excluded.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19296399Chronic asymptomatic pancreatic hyperenzymemia is a benign condition in only half of the cases: a prospective study.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23042375it's characterized by serum elevation of all pancreatic enzymes in the absence of underlying diseases; it occurs in either sporadic or familial form and it persists over time with considerable fluctuation in serum enzyme concentrations, including frequent normalizations. Proper diagnosis of this form of hyperenzymemia is important because it reassures the subjects having this anomaly that the syndrome is benign, and because it can prevent multiple and expensive diagnostic tests or useless hospitalizations or therapies. Chronic asymptomatic hyperamylasemia unrelated to pancreatic diseases.Summary of ""Chronic asymptomatic hyperamylasemia unrelated to pancreatic diseases.""Purpose: This study was addressed to assess the clinical characteristics of patients presenting with chronic hyperamylasemia unrelated to pancreatic diseases (CHUPD). Almost all patients presenting with chronic hyperamylasemia undergo expensive, long, difficult, and often unnecessarily repeated diagnostic procedures. This is in conjunction with the poor knowledge of the fact that besides hyperenzymemia secondary to pancreatic diseases and systemic illnesses, various non-pathological forms of chronic hyperamylasemia without relevant pathologic consequence can occur in clinical practice.Material and Methods: Data of all patients with CHUPD were retrospectively reviewed (June 1997-December 2009). Fifty one patients were included in the study; median follow up was 48 months (range 8-112 months). Their pre-enrolment diagnoses were: chronic pancreatitis in 31 cases (60.7%) and recurrent pancreatitis in 13 cases (25.4%); the remaining 7 patients (13.7%) were without a specific diagnosis.Results: Our observations, supported by diagnostic procedures (Ca19-9 serum levels, abdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and endoscopic ultrasonography) revealed that CHUPD was secondary to: a) benign pancreatic hyperamylasemia, 20 patients (39.2%); b) macroamylasemia, 18 patients (35.2 %) and c) salivary hyperamylasemia, 13 patients (25.4%).Conclusions: Due to the poor familiarity with CHUPD, the occurrence of this condition quite frequently leads to unnecessarily repeated diagnostic procedures.AffiliationAsymptomatic pancreatic enzyme elevation is a frequent clinical problem. In almost 90% of the cases the pancreas will be normal. In the remaining cases"

I had surgery 3/28 to get the nodule and the left side of my thyroid removed.

"Cancer","I think i have a brain tumour.","Hi there,I'm 17 years old and have suffered from severe anxiety, depression and borderline personality disorder for several years now.Recently I have been having weird things happen to me. I lost my vision while I was driving for a few seconds and afterwards my legs could not violently shaking and I felt like my body was trying to make me pass out and it didn’t feel like a panic attack. After that I have been extremely dizzy every single day (about a month now) to the point where I can't get out of bed. I feel motion sick when i close my eyes too. I got my eyes checked and they're fine. I have had severe headaches and pressure on my head I haven't experienced before on my left side near my temple which haven't gotten better from painkillers. I have had bad ears for a while now and feel like there's pressure on them and have been getting recurring infections but this time they healed up and I'm still experiencing hearing loss in my left ear especially (same side as headaches) even after getting wax sucked out of them. I have been extremely fatigue but at night i struggle to get to sleep regardless of how exhausted i am. I haven't been able to drink or smoke without feeling like passing out. I can't hang out with my friends because I get too faint. My eyes constantly feel tired and like they are drooping and sore. I also feel nauseous and a few nights ago started getting pins and needles and little pains in my left hand and left foot at the same time for hours. I get a massive pain in the middle right side of my abdomen on and off which disables me from exercising and hurts so much but the doctors don't know what it is (they think it's anxiety but I think it's way too extreme to be anxiety). I've been experiencing the pain for around 6 months now and initially thought it came on when I was anxious or stressed but now it happens all the time and I can't get rid of it. I've had blood tests and they are clear, ultrasound and x-rays are clear, urine and faeces tests are clear and I got an MRI yesterday and am TERRIFIED for the results because I've been so sad and unwell since I was 9 and could not handle my life being any worse."
"Cancer","I was drugged 7 months ago and I am terrified it has become a brain tumor","(23 year old Male)I made some bad decisions people, and I desperately need your help.I was at a concert for Halloween where I was drugged by a designer drug posed as LSD. I knew I was in for trouble when the tab stung my tounge and later on I had a killer headache, as if my brain was literally getting trampled. I thought I should just let it pass, but that is turning out to be a terrible mistake. Ever since that night, I felt a weirdness to my brain and the top of my scalp. I would constantly massage it hoping it would go away, but it has gotten worse since then. It feels like there are chemicals stuck in my brain just sitting there... which has resorted into some sort of brain disease/tumour. I've never hoped to be wrong as much as I do now, but my body is telling me this is destined to become a serious problem. Recently I discovered a red lump near the right front of my scalp, but it has gone away since. But I am certain it will come back depending on my condition. I researched brain tumors and the symptoms match in many ways.My head doesn't feel clear most of the day anymore. I can feel my brain swelling and aching when it is influenced by marijuana, but otherwise when I am sober, it's not so bad. I've been massaging it a lot these past few weeks, but have come to the realization that constant pressure might just be making it worse. So I'm trying to keep my hands away from my scalp as much as possible. I do not have proper health insurance, and now I am terrified this is going to result in irreversible conditions and in the worst case, cancer related death. I've been healthy most of my life with no preexisting conditions and few hospital visits.I have set an appointment to get it checked, but am in sincere need of your advice and suggestions. How could I treat myself before urgent care? What should I do in this situation? Thank you for your thoughts and suggestions. "

Whilst sitting I paid particular attention to a mole on my leg. It has always been there and if I am honest have never paid much attention to it tho noticed like a white spot in it. I picked the spot and it bled a little, this is the area to the top of the mole that Iooks light brown like a hole. What bothers me is not only this but the dark brown spot in the mole. Of course I have been on google and everything I read has me panicking. I then downloaded a skin vision app and took a photo of the mole it said high risk. I will get a doctors appointment but it is bank holiday and then I will probably have to wait 2 weeks to actually be seen. I have googled and am worried the bit I picked is an ulcer or the brown bit in the middle is an ulcer, melanoma that is ulcerated is not a good sign.

So I really paid it no mind until a few days later it didn't go away.. so I started to get a lil worried and started checking my neck and head for knots about a 3-4 days later I notice a knot in my neck so I mad a doctor's appointment. The doctor told me she thinks it's a knotted muscle and just give if a few weeks, she went on to ask questions if I been bitten or pulled a muscle I told her I don't think so.. so I let a week go by and the knot stil didn't go away .. so I started to research on the internet to see what it might be everything kept coming up as cancer.. so I went back and told her I'm scared it's cancer!!

"Cancer","I'm becoming increasingly scared that I might have mouth cancer ","Several sign have led me to believe that I could possibly have mouth cancer. I don't have pictures at the moment but I will take some later. For now all I can do is describe the symptoms.1. Quite some time ago I began to feel several lumps under my tongue. I can't see them in mirror because of their location, but they feel quite large and vary in size and shape (mainly circular).2. My tongue and uvula now touch (before this they didn't), and my tongue no longer rests in the bottom of my mouth, instead it now rests against the roof of my mouth.3. The floor of my mouth feels asymmetrical, the right side feels much higher than the left.4. I spoke to a doctor a while ago and she commented that there was a lot of redness, but told me it was probably allergies (but remember I can't even see the growths).5. One of my lymphnodes on the right side of my neck seems to be perpetually swollen, and the area of my neck below my chin and jaw look puffed up like a frog neck (I can't feel anying solid).6. The bottom of my tongue looks almost transparent (the big blue blood vessels are very visible).I will post photos as soon as possible.Several sign have led me to believe that I could possibly have mouth cancer.

"Cancer","Pancreas Cancer Scared","I've suffered with health anxiety for years always worried I have something wrong with me & with numerous visits to the doctors/a&e I've always been fine until last week.......For about 7 weeks I have been having upper stomach pains I went to my gp who advised it was ibs, pain continued went back doctors who advised gastritis. Anyone one day the pain was unbarable so I went a&e & I was admitted to hospital.They did lots of tests & my bloods came back that I had high levels of amylase so they said it's pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) I went for an ultrasound which came back fine so they sent me for MCRP (MRI) to see if I had any gallstones. The doctor advised no gallstones & that after 4 days in hospital I could go home.Just before I went home a doctor came to see me who advised that they have found something on my pancreas which it can be one of two things either an inflammation or cancer! He said that because I'm only 29 the chances are slim! He advised that the specialists are going to have a meeting & discuss my case. As you can imagine I'm sick with worry feel weak & cant not stop crying. Since being out of hospital the pain in my tummy has gone however I now have pain in my back & terrible diarreah which are both symptoms! I'm convinced I have it & I don't know if that's because I actually do have it or it's because of my anxiety. 0"

"Cancer","Melanoma scare","Hello, I'm a 21 year old female and noticed a small mole had appeared from no where on my left breast about 2 years ago and I just thought it was normal as I'm aware new mole grow. It then grew so I went to the doctor and he measured it at 8x5mm and told me to come back and we'll measure it again. I went back yesterday- 7 months after the previous appointment and it had grown another 4mm and is now 8x9mm and I was referred to a dermatologist... the wait is three months long so I've decided to see a private dermatologist today as I don't think I can spend three months worrying about it! I'm so concerned about it- my doctor used a dermoscope and says it doesn't have jagged edges or pigment and is a normal mole- it's just the rate it's grown- from nothing to a pin prick to slightly bigger than a pencil eraser in under 2 years. Could this be normal for a normal mole? I know moles do show up but do they show up as the size they're going to be or do they grow to the size the will be?

"Cancer","MRI Addendum 'Fluid on Lungs' - Lung cancer?","Hello All,I'm new here and have been reading lots of your posts in the hope that someone has been through something similar to me...I'm 33, had an MRI of my spine that found evidence of Ankloysing Spondylitis. However, there was also an addendum on the results saying that there was a 'small amount of fluid found at the bases of your lungs' and they have lined up a chest X-Ray for me on Tuesday. Obviously I went straight to 'doctor Google' (not good, I know) and all that keeps popping up is either heart failure or lung cancer! I have had no chest infections/coughs/blood in spit e.t.c that are symptoms of lung cancer, but I have read back pain can be a sign - or that there can often be no symptoms at all...Has anyone else had fluid on their lungs (plueral effusion) with no other symptoms or an apparent cause?I suppose what I'm really asking is if anyone can offer me any hope that they have been through the same thing and it turned out to be OK(ish!)."

Eventually the stiffness went away only to be replace with a constant pressure headache about 3 weeks ago.

That was 2 days ago. Just got the results back and they said they see an abnormality from the images but it's probably nothing. However they are scheduling me for an MRI.

"Cancer","extreme brain tumor fear","I am a 20 yo female and since May of 2015 I have been experiencing very strange and disturbing symptoms that at this point I am convinced I am going to die within the year and go back and forth with these thoughts. It is important to note that have serious anxiety, have had it all my life but after atraumatic event i felt a slight sense of derealization or brain fog back in May. I immediately attributed this to a brain tumor and went to my GP and received a neurological exam, eye exams, and blood tests which came back as normal, attributed this to GAD. An MRI was not recommended and of course I was terrified of that so I have never had one. I had a serious neck injury several years ago that never truly healed and simultaneously was experiencing neck pain again so I started seeing a chiropractor and it was determined my C1 and C2 and lower spine as well were severely and moderately subluxated. Within 4 hours after the first adjustment, I felt a strange sensation in my inner cheek that I would describe as fullness, not necessarily numb. I continued going 2x a week all summer and eventually this same feel spread throughout the same side of my face. Not numb, more of a ""pulling"" ""pressurized sensation. Concurrently, my anxiety has been getting much worse since and I have panic attacks fairly regularly and was recently prescribed xanax which is the only way I can stop thinking Im dying.Unfortnately, I attribute these attacks as being pre-seizures. Every day I think today will be the day of diagnosis, but I am too afraid to actually get an MRI because I'd rather live in ignorance as long as possible before my life is ruined and given an expiration date. Current symptoms still allow me to live my life, I'm in college, doing well, have friends, energy etc but this fear never leaves. Are my fears based in reality or can anxiety or possible nerve damage from these chiro sessions be the explanation? PLEASE someone help/ reassure/ guide me. The only hope I have is that its extremely strange all these symptoms began after I started seeing this chiro. All of these physical symptoms are worsened when I smoke weed, but it calms the thoughts down * pressureized/ tingling on left side of face, cheek under eye. (intermittent, helped by xanax), comes and goes *tighter muscles when closing that side's eye *left leg will feel ""weird"" but works completely functional, have had weakness measured, not weaker than the other, i go to the gym daily and do all normal things*occasional very inner ear blocking ?*still have neck pain, reverse curve was shown on X-ray *currently (recently terrified) cluster tension/ burning like head scalp pain on the right side. not necessarily a headache or migraine. * both eyes will intermittently just feel weird, pressure behind them * panic attacks, been obsessed with brain cancer since a girl i saw on the news died at 17 a few years ago. *alternating head pressure on right side *recently mind pops, memories (not flashbacks) of random events and occurences from anywhere from months to years ago.i have a spine MRi scheduled but im terrified it will show up nothing and ill be forced to face this reality. anyone who has actually had brain cancer please offer insight please someone help me and respond. sometimes i can convince myself that I am experiencing nerve damage/ peripheral neuropathy or even psychosomatic symptoms. however it has been 7 months. i really don't want to die and every day I envision sitting in a doctors office being told I have stage 3/4 GBM or DIPG."

A day after that, I got a migraine from not eating, this normally happens to me so I took an Anacin and felt fine. However, for the next three years, the persistent heavy headed/dizziness came back! I visited the doctors and he said he doesnt think its a tumor and does not suggest a CT scan because I dont present symptoms of a tumor. He thinks im stressing too hard for school since im a senior in college and ive been studying pretty hard.What do you guys think? My symptoms are basically persistent dizziness/heavy headed/slight head pressure, it makes me feel fatigued.

"Cancer","MRI Tech has me so concerned ","I had an MRI for a lump that was felt behind my knee by my orthopedic doctor. I've been seeing an orthopedist for leg weakness and lump behind my knee. He told me that he wasn't at all concerned about the lump. He was sending me for an EMG which he thought could be related to the weakness in my leg. The EMG came back totally normal so he said he thought the issue was in my back. He said he would go ahead and send me for the knee MRI just to make sure the lump wasn't pressing on any nerves or arteries that could be causing the pain. After the MRI was done the technician came in and said don't be surprised if they call you over the weekend to come back for a contrast MRI. Obviously, I asked why? She said there was something on the scan but didn't know what it was. She told me to come back to look at it on the screen. I asked her if she thought it was something bad and she said no she just hadn't seen something like that before that it was small and she didn't know what exactly it was. She said it could be on a nerve sheath or it could be a lymph node. I again asked should I be concerned? She said ""this is nothing to write home about.""I was getting dressed and I overheard the front desk lady ask her where to send my scans and she said send them to the radiologist at her house. I'm freaking out! If this weren't something serious why would she make those comments and send my scans to the radiologists house? Is that typical procedure for later appointments on Fridays that they get the scans at their house to review for the weekend? I don't know if she made those comments to try to prepare me or to ease my mind. Either way… Any insight would be very helpful"
"Cancer","Melanoma again?","I was diagnosed with malignant melanoma last February. I had surgery and was given the clear later in the year. It didn't spread to my lymph nodes.The last two weeks (at least) I had been itching an area on my hip, assuming it was a bite becasue thats the kind of itchiness it felt like. I never looked at it as it was always under my trousers so I just itched and ignored it. Tonight it itched while I was in the shower, and unfortunately I realised that it is a small dark mole. It has a very light pink ring around it, so I am pretty certain it is cancer again. I am still under the care of my skin cancer nurse, dermatologist, etc, so I am hoping for a quick process with the biopsy and etc.I'd like to know if anybody else has had melanoma multiple times? I'm terrified it will be more advanced this time. I'm only 24 and I have two young children. I'm trying to keep it together but I am absolutely gutted, and can't help but fear the worst and feel as though I won't live to see them grow up.Despite my diagnosis last year, I thought I'd be able to live a full life... was I wrong? Will melanoma keep on coming back? Will it eventually kill me?"
"Cancer","Scared i may have some sort of cancer","Hey all, new to this so here it goes..I am a 21 year old male and have some worrying symptoms and the docs say im fine.About 3 months ago i started to get some pain in the chest near my heart and shortness of breath, so I immediately went to the doctors and after seeing 3 different doctors all telling me i had some sort of virus and there was nothing they could do to help.I than seen another doctor who did an ecg which was normal. But after a week i still wasnt feeling well so went back and than had a chest xray and some blood work done. When i went to get the results back from the doctor i had gotten worse with my glands in my neck swelling up, my throat was killing me i could barely swallow! And it was all inflammed and puss covered, running a fever of 38.6 and night sweats with an aching body, And i had got an infection where blood was taken. They told me i had what looked like acute bronchitis in my right lung, and had a look over me for other swollen nodes and spleen and liver, which they said my glands in my groin were up and so was my liver and spleen. So the doctor immediately said i had glandular fever and gave me antibiotics. After a week of bed rest and having no appetite i still wasnt feeling well so i went back and the doctor told me i had been infected with ebv virus (which is what causes glandular fever) before so it couldnt be that. I than had more blood tests and a ct scan of my abdomen and pelvis done, which all come back fine aswell. Since than i still havnt regained my appetite and i have lost about 6 kgs, my glands in my neck are still up but not as bad. I have seen another doctor since and have had more blood tests taken and throat swabs and am due for a ultrasound on my glands on friday. I feel like my bones are starting to ache but i cant actually tell if im just thinking myself into it or not! I am so worried i have leukaemia or lymphoma or some other sort of cancer and i cant help but worry all the time about it i have been told that it could all just be anxiety but im hoping to get to the bottom of it so i can stop worrying myself into it. Sorry for the long post Hey all, new to this so here it goes..I am a 21 year old male and have some worrying symptoms and the docs say im fine.About 3 months ago i started to get some pain in the chest near my heart and shortness of breath, so I immediately went to the doctors and after seeing 3 different doctors all telling me i had some sort of virus and there was nothing they could do to help.I than seen another doctor who did an ecg which was normal. But after a week i still wasnt feeling well so went back and than had a chest xray and some blood work done. When i went to get the results back from the doctor i had gotten worse with my glands in my neck swelling up, my throat was killing me i could barely swallow! And it was all inflammed and puss covered, running a fever of 38.6 and night sweats with an aching body, And i had got an infection where blood was taken.

"Cancer","What's wrong me? Scared I have a tumour","I am 22, black, female, and live in England. 5""4 and 8 Stone 9 lbs. I'm Last year June I caught dysentery in Egypt, which led to alot of blood loss, extreme pain, weight loss, diarrhoea with mucus and loss of appetite. After a course of antibiotics it simmered down along however I was left with milder version of the symptoms. I continued to lose weight (4 stone over a year without trying), diarrhoea, blood both bright and dark black, mucus, extreme tiredness and belly pains. After going to the doctors, I was referred to a gastronlogist, and had a colonscopy. They suspected I had IBD however my results came back negative and they said I must have IBS. They also did a test (small biopsy of my bowel) to see if i had caught anything in Egypt and that has came back negative.I started to then twitch and have whole body jerks. It felt as though an electrical current was running through my body from my head. The jerks have been motor and vocal. I went to the doctors and they said that it was the loss of electrons due to the IBS (stomach issues). Since then I started to get further symptoms and they have got worse and worse listed as follows :Pins and needles in my legs and handsPain in head (unlike any headache/migraine I've ever experienced. It's different.)Right side of face goes numbMouth has twitched on the right sideGet twitching all over plus jerking of bodyRandom sharp pains over my body, it feels like nerve pains. I have experienced it on my face, fingers, hands, arms, legs, feet and back. (I have also woke up with a random pain in my foot that is consistent with now swelling etc. And then it's gone days later)Tiredness - I wake up tired, constantly tired - I can do something and feel instantly drainedDizzy Ness / lightheadednessConfusionMemory loss - I've started to forget things which scares me as I'm only 22Head feels funny most of the timeDiarrhea (I still get it however no blood)Weight loss (4 stone - I'm still losing it)Numbness on face as well (right side)Pain in my jawspeech has changed - finding it harder to get words outNausea plus dry heavingVisual changes (black spots and blurriness)temple pain in the right side of my face and I have felt a vein pulsating out of the templePain in foot / legs that comes and goesChest pains - this has started recentlyScratching my ankle yesterday and then part of my foot start twitchingRight leg goes deadBruising easilyMuscles spasmsPeriod has changed - longer/ heavier plus spottingHead feels heavySharp pain from head is now felt in neck, hard to lift my head up sometimes from the heaviness and sharp pains - plus the spaced out feelingI went to the doctors with this information and they just said stress. I don't believe this is stress as I tried telling him I haven't been stressed about anything ! I'm in constant pain and these symptom are an everyday occurrence. What could it be? It has been getting worse.The IBS has been occuring now for over a year. The other symptoms numbess, balance, tinnitus, sharp pain in head etc.. has been for the last few montths. I got a fasting blood test done which has shown high prolactin and low vit amin d.

"Cancer","Radiation","Hello. I am due to have ankle surgery next week followed by RAI (Radioactive Iodine Therapy) for Stage III Papillary Cancer 5 weeks 4 days later. The Radiologist was a tad concerned for me to have the surgery prior to the Radiation due to the possiblity of still have inflammation from the ankle surgery. The ankle surgery is for an old injury (10 years ago) that revealed just recently by MRI that I have a missing ligament that must of torn back then and some bone chips, calcification, etc. So it wil require pins and reconstruction. Anyone have any thoughts, experience or advice on the matter? It would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

"Cancer","I could post this in the Health Anxiety forum...","Hi everyone. The title says is it all. And I want to be sure to convey my respect, good wishes and hopes for cancer sufferers and loved ones; I hope that my anxious questions that follow don't offend. First of all, let me get to the point. I'm a 36 year old male health anxiety and depression sufferer. This developed in my late teens, focused on the time when my godfather fought a brave battle against endocrine cancer. He was just 41 when he passed away. Over the years my mental and physical health has been up and down. However, with the support of my wife (a mental health nurse in fact!), parents and close friends, I keep moving forward. Why am I posting? Lung Cancer. I am an ex-smoker. Neither proud nor seeking pity for such a stupid, destructive addiction. Off and on I smoked for 15 years, 10 a day at its peak, marlboro lights. I have launched numerous failed attempts to break free, but finally succeeded in November last year through hypnosis. Physically I experienced the numerous withdrawal symptoms over 3-4 months, but by the summer I felt good overall. For the last week or so, from nowhere, I've had a pretty constant discomfort in the right hand side of my chest. Quite sharp. Nothing shifts it in terms of pain relief. Due to my health anxiety I would certainly admit that it is constantly on my mind. No cough, weight loss, bloody spit etc. I have had some night sweats, though these have come and gone for over a year (coinciding with me changing to a new antidepressant, Sertraline).I would greatly appreciate your view and experience.

Her treatment finished 3 weeks ago and since then we new she would have side affects she was exausted as to be expected and for the 1st 2 weeks slept mostly and lost her appoetite. It looked as if she was getting over the worst of it when all of a suddon she became very confused and it was like she had alzimers she started thinking there was something wrong with her legs but after many tests there is nothing medically wrong with her. She seems to have all the symtoms of chemo brain x 100 . We realise now she is suffering from very bad anxiety thats basically took over the person she was. She is pacing the floor as her brain is telling her she can't sit down she gets very aggitated and has lost all her cognatuve brain funtions. No matter how much we try to talk her out of it she is not getting better. We have told the hosptal and her doctors but they don""t seem interested because its not anything medical. But right now we have lost our mum to this. We don't know what to do to help as its that bad she is not in control of her own mind and is acting like she has alzimers asking the same questions over and over. She is in lorazipaine vut at 1st they prescribed 1 tablet per day to be halfed. We have now been told to give her more because she is so bad but my dad is old school and does not beleive in giving her more even when she is asking because she can feel it coming on but he says no abd waits until she is to far into a panic attack that half a tablet is not really working. The familys at there wits end. Does anyone know someone who has had this reaction. Or what could help.

"Cancer","Persistent blood blister in mouth inner cheek","Hello - I'm a 23 year old male who's a non smoker, fit & healthy and from the UK. Over the last 3 weeks I've been having these red blood blisters appear in my mouth on the inside of my cheek where my teeth align (if that makes sense). At first I thought it was just where I may have bitten the gum numerous times or burnt it somehow but it's the forth time its come back and im starting to get worried. Not sure if ive only started noticing cos I don't normally check. It normally heals within a couple days but then just comes back in the same sort of area. I appear to have no other symptoms and haven't noticed anything different. Are these common ?What could this be ? I've read it could be mouth cancer which terrifies me but for someone of my age and situation it seems unlikely. Are blood blisters a sign of this or are there other symptoms also? Thank"s

"Cancer","Mums just died from Cholangiocarcinoma",":cry: My mum was diagnosed with Cholangiocarcinoma at the beginning of May, she died last weekend 7 weeks after diagnosis.She was a fit woman of 64, she didn’t drink or smoke and was very active. She started having problems with indigestion and was given ant-acids by the Dr, it was only when she became jaundiced that we realised there was something very wrong. She was taken to hospital and told that she had gall stones that could be easily removed. Oh how wrong they were.....it was only when we had her moved to a private hospital and they did CT scans and MRI scans that they discovered the tumour in her bile duct. She had a stent put in to take away the jaundice but she gradually lost so much weight she deteriorated rapidly.She spent the last few weeks of her life in hospital not being about to eat, she was even sick just before she passed away.Cholangiocarcinoma is a truly awful cancer, our family has been shattered. We are currently looking into this cancer and trying to find a common denominator between sufferers. My mum was a clean-a-holic and we are wondering if some of the cleaning products she used could be the cause....I found 5 bottles of Brasso in her kitchen cupboard last week :?"
"Cancer","Could this be a Brain Tumor or just anxiety?","Hi, for the past few days I've noticed minor speech slurring, if you could even call it that. For example I called hand sanitiser ""sand hanitiser"". Very minor, right away my anxiety has shot up, I suffer from chronic anxiety, which is most likely worsening or going to worsen symptoms. I have a friend in the medical field who told me this is what every human does, I'm just noticing it more due to my heightened senses due to anxiety. I've asked friends and family if they notice any speech issues and they all have said I sound exactly normal. Am I just overreacting from something that happens to everyone or is this an alarming sign? That minor symptom of messing up a word is all that I have, no headaches or fatigue or anything.

"Cancer","Bad symptoms are only getting worse, but no concern from doctors","I've had some chronic issues for nearly two years- severe fatigue and digestive issues- and have yet to get a diagnosis. I had pretty much resigned to the fact that I'd just have to learn to live with it, but symptoms have been appearing that I cannot ignore and things are going downhill so fast. Four months ago, I noticed several swollen lymph nodes in my neck. In a period of less than three months, I lost at least 30 lbs without any explanation. I saw an ENT who said he saw nothing concerning but ordered a CT of the neck, the abdomen, and a chest X-ray. All clear with the exception of the swollen lymph nodes, which are still not a concern despite their persistence and accompanying symptoms. A month ago I developed constant pain under my rib cage which has not been explained. This past week, my ribs have swollen to the point that it is visibly noticeable. I have several lumps in my breasts that were said to be fibrous tissue, a swelling on my breastbone that has not been explained, and lumps in my abdomen that I was told were fat deposits. I have seen a total of 7 doctors in the past 2 years and not only has there been no explanation for my severe and worsening fatigue, unexplainable weight loss, persistent swollen lymph nodes, and a number of additional symptoms (including night sweats, mysterious bruising, among a number of others), but there has been no concern for my health. Even though it seems to me that all signs point to cancer, regardless of my tests so far, I realize there are quite a number of other possible explanations. But no one will biopsy one of my nodes, or do a bone marrow biopsy, or any test that would rule out cancer. And whatever is causing everything, it is ruining my life. I get worse and worse all the time and no longer have any quality of life whatsoever due to the constant fatigue, weakness, and worsening pain. But every doctor says there's no cause for concern, likely nothing serious. My most recent appointment ended with the recommendation to take vitamin supplements, as that would likely clear up all of my symptoms he said. Am I losing my mind in believing that constant pain and worsening fatigue and severe weight loss and all of these lymph nodes that never go away are actually a cause for concern? I keep expecting my symptoms to warrant some kind of urgency in getting to the bottom of this, but no matter how bad things get, the response is always the same. How can you get well if you can't find a doctor who is willing to determine the cause of your illness? I don't even know what to do anymore if no one will help me figure out what is wrong. I apologize for the lengthy post but I'm so hopeless at this point and am desperate for any advice anyone might have in finding the right doctor who will do a biopsy or try to figure this out somehow.

"Cancer","CT Scan following chest x ray","I had a lasting cough that was not going away. I went for a chest x ray and was told straight away that I needed to go back for a CAT scan as there was something viewed that needed further examination in more detail. The radiographer said that it was the doctor that advised this. She said not to worry and tried to reassure me it might simply be an infection. I'm a life long smoker and I am not stupid that this could be lung cancer. Surely they wouldn't get me back for a ct scan if they simply thought to was an infection. I am now waiting on appt. they said it would be within a couple of weeks and I am really worried now the more I think. Would they just get me back in for a ct scan to determine an infection or something other than lung cancer?"

"Cancer","Head pain! Tumour?","Back in April I started getting really bad head pains. It felt like someone came up to me and hit me in the back of the head with a brick! I'd grab my head and cry out in pain. Any sudden jolt would cause it like sneeze or my child head butting me as toddlers do! I'd have 3 or 4episodes a day! Felt like an incredibly bad ice pick headache. I went to my GP and she said it was referred neck pain and gave me painkillers. It got worse so I went a&e where they did a CT, MRI, bloods, neurological tests and came back clear. After a few days it subsided and went. Lasted about 10 days in total.The past few days it feels like it's coming back. I don't know if I should go GP again. I just keep thinking it's a brain tumour! I just keep waiting to pass out or for my nose to start bleedingThanks I am really trying not to freak out because my parents don't believe anything serious is wrong so they won't take me for an mri or anything and I'm trying to think rationally that if it really were something to worry about it probably wouldn't have gone away for a bit. But it still is in the back of my head and worries me.Can someone, anyone, please reassure me or share experiences.

"Cancer","Brain tumour symptoms? Advice pls","I have also posted elsewhere in the hope I will find some answers! Here's my story sorry it's a long one just trying to explain these horrid worrying symptoms. I have never been one for headaches apart from in my last pregnancy.I started with constant headaches 5 months ago but this co-incided with starting a new drug for anxiety called citalopram. I just put it down to a side effect but rather than it get better after time it has got worse to the point I decided to quite quickly come off the tablets after 4 months of these headaches.The headaches are like a heavy head/dull pressure type pain. Its over whole head but worst behind eyes. It felt alot like eye strain.After coming off the tablets headaches are even worse I thought due to withdrawal symptoms but its now four weeks after stopping.I also have an awful stiff neck and pain into lower skull. Lower back pain, flashes of sudden dizziness especially when moving my eyes.I have this headache 24/7 it never goes not even with extra strong pain killers.It is worse at night and in morning and when I wake and turn on side I feel really nauseous.I have bad brain fog feeling like I can't get on with anything and trouble looking after two demanding young kids as I am in constant pain.Has anyone else suffered these same symptoms, constant headache, head pressure, nausea and dizziness?I'm so scared that there is something not right and have been to the doctors who are going to refer me to neurologist. However my hospital is under staffed and have been told waiting list could be over 6 months they are not even sure if they are taking on new patients. sadSo not sure where this leaves me?From a v scared mummy sad"
"Cancer","Diagnosed with cervical cancer :(","Hi. I am actually writing this on behalf of my sister. She was diagnosed with cervical cancer this week. I feel quite guilty as I have been along with her for the ride, loads of GP and hospital appointments and was never picked up but I knew in my gut something wasn't right and feel I should have pushed harder for her.Her symptoms - erratic bleeding, from no bleeding at all to passing massive clots and bleeding a huge amount but blood tests were always fine. Lower back pain that comes and goes. Abdominal pain that comes and goes, like a contracting pain. Occasional nausea and feeling full very quickly.Her journey - September was when the bleeding got really bad although things had been erratic for a couple of months before that. We got her an appointment at the local emergency doctors as it was the weekend and they referred her to a and e. They examined her, took swabs etc etc but no smear test. She was sent home. Couple of weeks later back to the hospital again. They asked her if she had pain or bleeding afetr sex which she didn't. Her smear was still not due for a couple of months so again was left at that and sent home with transhemic acid for the bleeding. They did an ultrasound which found a small cyst and they put everything down to that, even though she was getting pain on the other side to the cyst. Eventually got seen by gynaecology outpatient team in January who just so happened to do her smear, thankfully she was not bleeding that day so they could do it. Came back as severely abnormal cells, seen in colposcopy who said eveything looked fine but did a biopsy 'just in case' thank goodness they did as that's when it came back as cancerous. They are thinking they have caught it early, in fact stage 1b going by the biopsy but will not know for certain until she has her scans. The general plan now is hysterectomy with or without radiotherapy, again, depending on scan results.I guess my question is, are all the symptoms she is having 'normal' for such an early stage of cancer?Thanks so much for reading, any input greatly appreciated "

"Cancer","Anxious about my father's health."," My father has had a cough for around 4 months now. It doesn't happen while he's sleeping, and there is no discharge. So of course, I googled what could cause chronic coughs. The first result was throat cancer. I didn't think much of it as my father had no other symptoms. Last month, his lymph nodes got swollen. Then I started to worry. Swollen lymph nodes were definitely a symptom of throat cancer. I urged my father to go to the doctor, which he did. The doctor thought it was just an infection, but once my father brought up the coughing, he was sent for a throat ultrasound. It came back clean, but then he was sent for a chest x-ray as well. Clean. So the doctor prescribed my father some antibiotics as the lymph nodes were likely due to an infection, and the coughing was said to be due to allergies. Well, the doctor was right about the lymph nodes just being infected. They went down after a few days. However, my father is still coughing all the time. He has no other symptoms, but i'm still worried that the x-ray missed something. My aunt was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer that spread to the bone last month even though she had a mammogram which missed the tumour. I'm now afraid that my father may have the same issue."

Right now, I dont have any migraine type headache, or some strong pain on my head, but it definitely feels strange. I have this sudden mild sharp pains on left and right side of my head, I feel a bit disoriented, like if Im going through the motions.

Like yesterday I got this burning sensation running across my neck and left arm, I felt like if I was passing out, and my toungue went numb. If had a hand full of these attacks, so now I kind of control them better. Sometimes it feels so real, that I cant control it much. I dont know if that has to do with my head's feeling. I also have sudden ear pains. Any help will be much appreciated, thanks in advance."

"Cancer","Scared I have brain cancer","Hi. I am a 24 year old female. Five months ago I began having a localized headache to the top right part of my head. It took about a week to go away after no medications worked. I saw my doctor and she said I had a sinus infection but she was more worried about the heart condition I have so she didn't pay too much attention to my head. After using some herbal remedies the headache went away and I went on with my life. My father passed away two weeks ago and three days ago the headache reflared. Localized to the top right part of my head and it's not agonizing but it's annoying. I feel pressure throughout my whole head and sometimes it trickles down to my neck. IT feels like my head is being squeezed in a vice. Nothing horrible but enough to get me worried. No medication is working. I am heavily addicted to caffeine and I haven't slept a full night since last year. I work a full time job as well. I don't know if any of this could have anything to do with my headaches. The only other symptom I am having is slight vertigo but no major dizziness or vomiting or nausea. I am always clumsy so maybe that could play into it. I don'tknow. I do plan on seeing my doctor next week but could someone relieve my tensions a bit so I don't work myself into a tizzy before I can see my doc? Thank you. "
"Cancer","Indigestion for 4/5 months. Cancer or gastritis?","So, I had this burning feeling in my stomach appear from out of nowhere and eventually decided to go see the doctor about it. I was told it's just an inflamed lining of the stomach (gastritis). I also have laryngopharyngeal reflux if that helps any. I've also started to burp a lot, which is supposedly a symptom of early stomach cancer. I was prescribed omerprazole (20mg twice a day) each month until now. I've had enough of not knowing what I'm dealing with here. My doctor believes I have cancer-phobia(?) and just dismisses me. I've also seen 2 other GP's for second opinions and they gave me the same answer and talked about how rare it is for someone my age without risk factors to develop it etc etc.(I'm 20.) I have an endoscopy booked for late august but that feels too far away. I literally can't cope anymore. I've considered going private and getting the endoscopy over and done with but it's really expensive to see a gastroenterologist. So any opinions would be greatly appreciated because I no longer know what to do. I don't even want to get out of bed anymore. Should i go private and just be in debt for a while or should I wait it out and hope it isn't anything serious? Also, if anybody has an actual statistic or something so I know exactly how rare this kind of cancer is for a 20 year old that would also be very helpful. Sorry if this sounds like a rant, I just have nobody else to talk to about this. Nobody takes me seriously. Thanks "

"Cancer","feeling concerned","I was just notified by my doctor that I needed to come in for a biopsy. I recently had a internal ultrasound. About a month ago, I had a very light period (only a day).

I havent had a period for almost 2 years, I'm 53 years old. So my doctor did an exam, my yearly pap and the ultrasound of my ovaries. The pap was fine, my uterus lining is good, my ovaries are good, but they found ""mucus trapped in my uterus"" those were her exact words. So now I wait for 4 days for the biospy.

"Cancer","Paranoid about brain tumour ","I have always been worried about a brain tumour since suffering for headaches forever.

Yesterday I went shopping and I felt so ill and dizzy, every time I went on an escalator I felt so dizzy and the feeling lasted all day, I felt really off balance and had a huge headache.

"Cancer","I was diagnosed with follicular thyroid cancer","Hi!!!! I recently had the rest of my thyroid removed and they diagnosed the last half of my thyroid that was left to have follicular thyroid cancer. It was so small and went to four different pathologists because it was so small. And did determine that it was a slow growing cancer. So they removed it and said i needed to go through iodine radiation treatment. For precaution reasons just in case it broke through and spread somewhere else. So now i had to do that low iodine diet and i have to take the I-131 pill tomorrow is my appointment. March 18th 2016. Im very scared still throwing it back and fourth if i should just wait and not do it maybe try canabis oil cbd only and see if that works. They also say that the radiation could also cause cancer to spread to my lungs and lymphnodes in my neck. Has anyone else had this and would u say do the treatment, or try something natural. I really am scared to do this but havent heard it from anyone who had this done had cancer again from any suggestions thanks laurie"
"Cancer","Has someone been throwing satsumas?","Hello to all fellow sufferers out there! I was diagnosed with a glomus jugulare tumour which is somewhere between the size of a golf ball and a satsuma (surgeon's words not mine) last November and am going into hospital in a few weeks for embolisation and surgery but have found it incredibly frustrating that there seems to be so little information about this type of tumour and even less support for sufferers and their families and friends. After finding the Patient UK website and reading the postings, I'm hoping that some of my frustrations will be alleviated.I dont know whether its me imagining it or whether I really do have the tumour from hell!! Reading the bits of info on the internet Glomus jugulare tumours seem to have a variety of symptoms and unless you are pretty unlucky, as I seem to be, you only get one or two of the symptoms. I have (in no particular order) pulsating tinnitus, loss of hearing, facial paralysis which stops me closing my left eye, a nose that feels as if its caved in if I lay on my right hand side, the inablility to smile on the left hand side of my face, paralysis of the vocal chords/voice box, loss of balance not to mention the headaches which come with the pressure in my head. Sometimes the only way to get through the day is to have a bit of a giggle about it and make jokes about people throwing satsumas at me.If your still reading, by now you must think that I'm a right looney tune but I can assure you I'm not. The doctors have told me that once my surgery is over I have to have gamma knife therapy and be monitored for years and I want to know everything I can about this type of tumour, this type of surgery and the after effects and what I can expect in the future.If anyone wants to share their experiences please get in touch x"

"Cancer","nervous about undergoing Chemo.","I am about to undergo Chemotherapy for Cancer. Ihave been researching other, alternative treatments for cancer after reading that the conventional treatments have a low percentage 5 year survival rate (average about 2 to 5%). Why is chemotherapy recommended when it has such a poor record of long term success in treating cancer? There seems to be very little data on 10 year survival rates.I am quite often hearing the question, ""Why aren't some of these Alternative Medicine treatments of serious illness subjected to thorough and expensive clinical trials to test their efficacy?""I had often wondered about this but then I realized that if the treatmentdidn't involve an expensive machine or a patentatable substance, then there would be no return on any investment covering the immense cost of such a trial.For example, if Sodium Bicarbonate was found to effectively treat a serious disease, this substance could be bought anywhere for a few dollars. No return on that investment. This situation would tend to ensure that every treatment of serious disease would always be very expensive regardless whether it was the best one. (with minimumside effects etc.). Most of the standard cancer treatments involve awfullside effects and many of the alternative ones are low in side effects.I am very concerned that I will rush into a treatment that promises little and has awful side effects."

I have just got back from the Drs which I went to due to 8ish months of bleeding dark blood about 2 weeks prior to every period, also got worse when I went for a number 2 or strained in anyway.Anyway at the exam she said she needed to call another GP in as she saw a red area next to my cervix on the vaginal wall, it bled from the touch of the speculum. They took swabs which also caused bleeding and they said they would refer me to gynaecologist, I heard them taking outside the curtain and words such as quick appointment etc were mentioned, I did ask her if this was to do with cervical cancer as I've had more than 1 abnormal smear before along with various biopsies and a letz procedure but she's lovely and didn't want to worry me so she just said it's probably nothing don't worry. The appointment time was 4-6 weeks which is not emergency cancer screening but the next level.Now as mentioned I've had abnormal smears, 3 or 4 biopsies and 1 letz, my last smear came back as OK so I was finally put back on 3 years smears.Upon reading about vaginal cancer it says it very rare and more commonly cervical cancer can migrate into the vagina.my question is has anybody had a similar situation, has an examination brought up a red sore patch near anyone's cervix and what was it, did you have further tests?I don't need reassurance as such I just want to know what I'm dealing with. I like to be mentally prepared. I want to know my stuff by the time I get to see gynaecologist.

I'll feel like there is a rubber band around my head and sometimes it will feel like a hot burning feeling in my head. In the past month I've had three weird nights. I would feel like I'm about to fall asleep and then I would feel like I forgot how to breath and I would jolt awake with my heart racing and feeling hot.

I took a course of antibiotics for a sinus infection 6 or 7 weeks ago I had a CT scan in April and nothing was found Bloodwork done in december and everything was normal (Checked for anemia, thyroid, liver, kidneys, etc.) only thing unusual was a slightly elevated level of iron. I recently heard something about Candida overgrowth and a major cause can be a course of antibiotics. My symptoms have showed up right around that time frame and many of them are similar to candida. I'm overall very scared. I'm a college student in a happy realtionship and don't know what kind of stress can cause anxiety and my symptoms also can be from brain tumors. I just want some answers because my doctors don't know what's going on.Anyone have any ideas? Thanks,Matt"

In doing Ct for that they found almost 1 inch mass in left kidney and about 1/2 inch one in right. I know these are rather small, But because of the Diver I have to wait 2 months for partial kidney romaval on left side. Docs said they dont know if it is cancer until biopsy when they do removal. I have had 5 uranalysis since and all show trace of blood in urine and uti and kidney stones have been ruled out and according to what I have read the only other thing to cause is cancer. Anyway for about a month I have had continual pain on leftside all right under ribs and pressure on it makes hurt more. Nausea too but no vomiting. Quetions are has anyone who has this small of a mass had pain? if so did they find out why? My doc has said it is to small to cause pain. I have read that if it has spread that it can cause pain but can find nothing about how large of a growth it has to be to spread so can it be this small and have spread? I also from all my reading it said if you have blood in urine then it means the cancer has progressed..so why is my doc not taking note of this, Please help. tell me your stories pleasethanks"
"Cancer","Bleeding Lung Cancer","I would like some help, if I may... About 4 months ago, my father-in-law was diagnosed with stage 3-4 ""incurable"" lung cancer. He is 61 years old trady, fit and healthy. During his lifetime he had smoked for a decade, from about 20 - 30 years old... His condition is super tricky for everyone who had happened to see him, as he has a leaking lung cancer... Honestly, guys, I never knew cancer can be leaking as well... Due to that reason no one wants to taught him... His haemoglobin is very low, which means they are keep giving him transfusions... Anyway, good 3 weeks ago, he had a stroke as well... Now he is out of the hospital in my care... He has lost a lot of weight ... I looked at a lot of things about cancer and found him lot of people... However, I truly respect all his choices... The only treatment they have done was a 5 day long radiotherapy, which he was told to stop the bleeding, instead he had a stroke 2 days later... As I said before, all Drs are scared to do anything to him.... I believe, I have finally found the ultimate integrated professor in Melbourne... Unfortunately, I need to wait to see him until the 2/2... If I may, I would love any suggestions on the subject of how to stop his bleeding...Does anyone knows if natural until-inflementery foods like turmeric, can increase the bleeding for the cancer patient like himself with a bleeding cancer??? This is my latest puzzle, however, I can not find the answer for it...Thank you so much for taking your time and reading this post and possibly supporting us... A massive gratitude to you all, xoxo Janet"

"Cancer","convinced of BT","in addition to many other posts, for the past 8 months I have been convinced I have a brain tumor. the only medical evidence against this was normal pupil dilation, and no papilladema, and normal blood results. im too scared to get an MRI because i know I'm dying why live my last months in misery. im in college and no one would know i was experiencing these things. recent symptoms that are furthering the convincing are:-burning like scalp sensation on right side of head- i constantly have random memories pop into my head. not flashbacks or auras just memories of random irrelevant things that happened many years ago.diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder, moderate/severe c1/c2 vertebrate problems, OCD. could this be psychosomatic/ neuropathy/ anxiety or do any of these sound like real BT symptoms. i really dont want to die and I feel an apathy towards things- like why should i study for finals if im going to die? i doubt ill see my 21st birthday and I just hope this diagnosis comes after the holidays so it doesnt ruin everything for my family. someone please help.

"Cancer","Worried about cancer - Abdomen","Hi all,I'm Tom, 23, and I've had quite a worrying time recently. Cancer is a big thing in my family, and being a huge hypochondriac it's always the first thing that comes to mind when I get ill.It started out as frequent urination (but no pain) about a month and a half ago, they took a urine sample, and found a trace of blood, which was scary, they tested me again to be safe, prescribed me antibiotics. The test came back clear and there was no trace of blood present anymore, which was a relief. But basically in that time, I had this kind of dull pain/discomfort and popping sensation almost, just below my ribcage, where my liver is. I described this to the doctor and he put me through for routine blood tests.The results came back, kidney function normal, white blood cell count perfectly normal, liver function normal, but an elevated liver enzyme (Not sure which). This immediately had my alarm bells ringing, because as soon as I started looking online (I apologise I know this is frowned upon) Cancer was the hot topic. Pancreatic, liver, gall. I instantly panicked. I got these results back on the 2nd October. I was referred to the local hospital for an ultrasound. In that time things kind of developed a bit. My stool has been on and off, some quite pale, some normal but greasy. The pain (In my upper right) had changed slightly, almost feels like burning almost, inflammation? The pain has also spread to the left hand side, and I've noticed my appetite has gone a bit weird.. I still feel hungry, but not as much. Although, once I eat I can eat the normal amount. There's no nausea or vomiting, I don't have jaundice or any odd marks on my skin. Not sure about weightloss, as I've been running 3/4 times a week and eating healthier food. So it would be quite hard to see where the loss has come from. There's no heartburn, It's basically the pain, and the appetite. I went for an ultrasound today, and the specialist there told me what he could see, as he could see how scared I was. He said that no abnormalities had shown up, which to me was a slight relief but not a complete one. I know Google is a huge no go for stuff like this, but afterwards my instant reaction was to google 'Elevated liver enzymes and pain, ultrasound clear' and there were some positive responses, and some scary ones, stories of people being told by their doctors they have IBS and all these different problems that are easy to deal with, and then a year later, they've got stage 4 cancer. Nobody wants cancer, and I feel awful posting anything on here because I don't want to complain when there are people who are seriously ill, but there's always the possibility and I feel like I need help. My friends, family, girlfriend all think I'm overreacting and are telling me not to worry, which makes me feel worse, I know it shouldn't but it does. The worst part is as soon as you google any symptom, cancer is always the first thing that's mentioned. I do believe I have a seriously problem mentally when it comes to my health, but I'm genuinely worried about my physical health at the moment.It's difficult to separate the symptoms. I suffer from really bad depression, so being tired all the time is a big thing for me. I also hardly sleep as I go to bed quite late, and get up early meaning I have no way of telling if the tiredness is from stress, my depression, or an actual issue. When it comes to my stomach, ever since the age of 13 I've had on and off issues with my abdomen, the doctor couldn't find an issue whenever I went, and he put it down to an 'inflamed appendix'. I had an incident when I was 18, where I had drank a ridiculous amount of alcohol, to the point where I was throwing up bile. After this, for about 4 months, I had constant problems with my stomach, really bad acid reflex, it was awful. This eventually passed. I've experienced loss of appetite in the past, but it was very different, I couldn't even look at food without wanting to be sick, but it's not felt like this. I can eat food, I can stomach it, I don't feel nauseous, it just feels odd? Another problem is that I have a really severe vitamin D defiency. I've been quite silly recently and I've not taken them in a long long time.. I've been told that it can help with your digestion etc? Not sure how true that is. It's hard to know if some of it's psychological, if it's sevaral issues in my body that are causing all different kinds of symptoms, I really don't know. All I know is I'm scared, and even though I have quite nice results from the ultrasound, I don't feel convinced? You constantly hear of people being misdiagnosed, and I don't want to be one of those people. If it is something as severe as the worst.. I'd like a fighting chance. Thank you all for your time, I understand I may sound completely ridiculous. I just have no idea what it might be.It's kind of interfering with my life, I think I've convinced myself of the worst, started losing track of my own life.. it's gotten out of hand really.Apologies for the rant, and thank you to anybody who reads this and has felt the same in the past."

"Cancer","scared to death that I have cancer ","started experiencing some bloating about a week ago & since I ve been trying to have a baby I took a pregnancy test. It was positive. All of the tests I took were positive. I started having bloating & frequent urination. I m VERY bloated, I look 3 months pregnant. Also I am peeing all the time. For the past 2 months I keep getting this pain on my lower right side of my abdomen. It isn t constant but it happens 1-3 times a day. Yesterday it got bad & I went to the ER. They did HCG count & a bunch of other blood tests. The pregnancy test was positive, my white blood cell count was normal, but my HCG level was 292. They said that s pretty low so they did an ultrasound and didn t see the baby. They did a pelvic AND tv ultrasound. They said the pain I was having was most likely not pregnancy related. On the ultrasound they checked my appendix, uterus, ovaries, etc. Everything was normal. I read that HCG count can be used to detect cancers. I m worried that I am not pregnant. They said with gastrointestinal cancers it can be found. With the pain I m having, bloating, gas, and frequent urination it seems to be less related to pregnancy and more related to another issue. I am only 2-3 weeks pregnant, I shouldn t be having symptoms at all. I m getting another HCG count done tomorrow to see if the ""pregnancy"" has progressed. My period was due today but I didn t get it. I am also having vaginal discharge that is clear and odorless. Please give me some advice."
"Cancer","worried over basal cell carcinoma treatment ","I have had for around two years a small reddish bump on my forehead that I thought at first was an insect bite and then when it persisted assumed was a cyst. When I eventually got round to seeing the GP she sent me off to community dermatology where a GP with a special interest in dermatology thought it was a Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC). I was then sent a couple of days ago to a small local hospital that I guess under NHS reorganisation is now a community health facility of some kind and the dermatologist immediately said by looking - without a biopsy - that she was sure it was BCC - she said this without doing a biopsy - and gave me a choice of excision, curettage and cautery, or a cream. I asked about Mohs but she said it is used only for hard to treat areas of the face such as nose or eyelids. She did not recommend excision, said the scar would be worse as it involves stiches and generally was not encouraging about it, so the choice was between cream or curettage and cautery. I chose the latter over a cream as I thought there would at least be a biopsy involved and I wasn't sure a cream would be as effective. She said my BCC was particularly flat. I had the curettage and cautery yesterday, but now read on the Patient.co.uk detailed briefing on Basal Cell Carcinoma that curettage and cautery is NOT recommended for the face. Also, I am worried that the margins of burnt out tissue may not have been wide or deep enough, making recurrence or spread. Can this be checked? I am supposed to go back to the doctor, or perhaps just a nurse, in two weeks. Could the fact I'm in my mid-60s have been a factor why eg Mohs was not offered? Is Mohs not freely available on the NHS? In retrospect I wish I had been given more time to consider the treatments the doctor offered. I feel I was rushed into a decision - and as I said, I had not had a biopsy previously, though she did a scrape during the procedure that I assume will be biopsied. Would I have done better to have gone with the excision? - I wonder know if she discouraged it in order to save time in a busy clinic, or for NHS financial reasons. Should I have tried to scrape together savings and tried to go privately? - if say rationing of some kind is affecting recommendations of treatments?Another thing is that although I know BCC is generally not fatal, and I took it all in my stride up to now - felt strangely calm about it - now I have had the curettage and cautery, and have a red circular wound on my forehead, I am suddenly very anxious and even a bit depressed. I have not told anyone in my wider family (I am single) or friends about the BCC - partly not wanting to be seen through a cancer ""lens"" even though BCC is less serious than many other cancers."
"Cancer","Worried I have pancreatic cancer...","Hello, first post here and am looking for any help available. [Smile] Apologies for the length of the post but I wanted to be thorough. OK, so I have felt unwell since I had a tooth taken out which had infection after infection and resulted in about 6 antibiotic courses over 2 months. Around the same time, I thought I'd pulled a muscle whilst sleeping as I had that kind of pain in my left side (torso area) with a feeling of something under/behind the bottom of my left ribcage. The pulled muscle pain has subsided but the weird rib sensation has remained (I likened this feeling to the feeling you get when you are pregnant and the baby has a foot in your ribcage). Along with this my bowel movements have been a bit crazy with more diarrhea than normal and more of an urgency to go. Couple of times movement's have been eggy smelling but mostly OK. It can be normal for me not to go to the toilet for 3/4 days and I can have solid motions too. I have had sharp pains under ribcage area too but not always. My stomach/gut area in general feels like it has been turned inside out, like when you have been sick many times. Sometime on my left hand side it feels like something is twisting/pinching inside. All of the pains/sensations have been constant as in everyday but sometimes I can get in a position which alleviates the ribcage foot feeling. I am eating OK but not huge amounts but I think this is due to my anxiety. In the last couple of days (bearing in mind this has been going on overall for weeks), I have had period like pains in my lower abdomen and lower back and a discomfort/ache in my very upper right back in between my shoulder blade and spine. This feels like posture ache and like the muscle could be massaged out of a knot. My shoulders and upper arms have also been aching. Tests so far: Chest Xray - clear VQ Scan (for clots) - clear Blood tests (including FBC, LFT, U&E, Pancreas, Haemoglobin...that is all I can remember) - all clear Stool sample - clear Abdomincal Xray - clear I have seen a gastro consultant and he think this may be IBD, possibly Chron's. Due to have an abdominal ultrasound Thursday morning and colonoscopy Friday. Previous history of 2 perinanal abscesses which the consultant thought was 'interesting' as it is rare to get one let alone two for my age/gender/race etc. Apparently I should have had my colon checked after the second abscess but this never happened. I have been googling (I know I shouldn't) and have come across so may things that point to pancreatic cancer and I'm absolutely worried sick, more so about this diagnosis than another cancer as the survival rate is so poor. Does anyone have any experience of my symptoms or pancreatic cancer to comment? I would really appreciate some advice. Thank you in advance to any who reply X"

My body has weird symptoms sometimes and my stomach hasn't been feeling right for 5 months now. It feels like I need to throw up sometimes(I have a lot in earlier months but thats kind of stopped now) and I have some pains throughout my body now. I have no health insurrance so I'm not sure I can keep going back to the hospital just for them to tell me its not nothing like they have before."
"Cancer","Glomus JugulareTumor","I was diagnosed with a left glomus jugulare tumor in 1996. At that time, surgery was not an option. The tumor was too deep. It started at my jugular bulb and grew toward my brain stem, rather than up into my ear canal. It was treated with radiation. My most recent MRI, July 2007, indicates it is probably growing again. There is some question because my MRI center recently got a new magnet. It is unknown whether the tumor is growing, or if it is just a better image.I see a surgeon next week. In anticipation of that appointment, I searched the web for information.Imagine my amazement at finding so much information! And people who actually have this same tumor. I looked for others in 1996 and a time or two since then, with no luck.I have mild to sever frequent headaches. I lost some hearing in both ears and have a real hard time with tinnitus. Hearing aids help mask the tinnitus, as well as improve my hearing. I am off balance and dizzy every day and have lost my balance, falling to the floor twice in the last month. I walk with a cane but was not using it both times I fell.I feel very blessed that the tumor is not maglignant and unlikely to become so. I would love feedback from others who have had their tumor for ten plus years...those who were unable to have surgery...and others with experience of this very unusual tumor.Thanks, Paula from the middle of the USA"

I would even go to dr appointments wan out my breasts. I started my period when I was 9 years old, two months before I turned 10. I was told that one breast was bigger than the other, but I never really tried looking at them to see the difference.I have horrible anxiety and have been so worried about my health. My left breast has been hurting and I've gone to the doctor twice for it. Both visits included breasts exam and no lumps were found. I'm waiting for an ultrasound but wouldn't get one for 2-3 weeks. But the waiting is killing me. There's no history of breast cancer in my family. I look at my breast now and I'm examining them carefully and one breast (the one that hurts) is slightly larger than the other and I've noticed that both of my nipples are inverted. I've had them inverted for almost as long as I can remember but don't remember if they were like this in my childhood. Both doctors didn't make comments about my nipples but that I know the symptoms of breast cancer I'm terrified.Only symptoms I have is the pain and inverted nipples. Also my boob is slightly larger than the otherBut the last two symptoms I could have had all my life but just haven't noticed them till know because I'm now being aware of changes in my body. How likely is breast cancer? "

I went to my doc and he is sending me for a ultra sound and a mammogram at the end of this month. The only other symptom I had was a bit of pain in my breast but not an uncomfortable amount. I have read every article about whether it could be a cyst or a lump or whatever. I feel like it's just a cyst or something benign. I am 18 years old by the way. Anyways, what my question is, is can birth control give you lumps or anything? I was on tri cyclen for 6 months but my doctor made me come off of it when I saw him last (2 or 3 weeks ago) and today I noticed that the lump seems a little smaller, and I was wondering if maybe the extra hormones in my birth control could have lead to it!

"Cancer","My husband was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma on 30th December.","'Probable cholangiocarcinoma' is what the discharge notes from hospital actually said. He had had sky high liver function tests a month earlier and an MRI scan had shown some 'sludge' in the bile duct. An ERCP was performed which unfortunately did not unblock the duct and a bypass stent was inserted by the consultant. [I'm not sure if it was a radiologist or a gastroenterologist who did this procedure, rather think it may have been the latter]. Anyway the temporary stent was replaced a few days later by a permanent metal one. We were told that they had not collected any tissue to do a biopsy as it was hard to access without disturbing the blockage, hence the 'probable' diagnosis. He is 84 and was told the only treatment is palliative care and that the stent would become blocked in a few months and would probably need replacing. A CT scan showed no spread of the cancer. Prior to a routine follow up appt in mid April with the consultant he had a full blood count and liver function tests done which were fine [haemoglobin was a bit low] but the bilirubin was now in single figures [6] and the ALT was now 78 where it had been 305 at the end of December. The GP was pleased with these results as was the gastrochap when we saw him later that week. He didn't examine him, just asked questions. As we left he said he wasn't going to do any scans [I imagine until they were needed] and to just 'go off and enjoy life'and he hasn't got another appt. So we did and have just returned from 10 days with our daughter in France where he enjoyed the wine and sunshine! It's hard to believe there is actually anything wrong with him he looks so well although he does tire easily but then he is 84 and has been becoming slower for some years now.i am probably tempting fate by asking if it is possible that this diagnosis is wrong? They did not do a biopsy as I said and he was told the stent would block up in 3 or 4 months. It is now almost 5 1/2 months and he is seemingly well, eating as normal too. "

My vision has got considerably worse over the past few months aswell which I've had multiple appointments about, ever since my pulsatile tinnitus started I've been having stabbing pains in my left temple (it's my left ear that suffers with tinnitus) and I'm incredibly lethargic and feeling euphoric or completely agitated.. I'm getting no answers from my doctors, but I'm going back tomorrow and demanding they stop fobbing me off with 'it'll go away on it's own'. I just wondered if anyone has dealt with these symptoms and got a diagnosis or answer as to what may be the cause ?"

"Cancer","Why am i being referred to a specialist?","I hope people don't mind me asking this particular question on the forum but i just hope someone can reassure me. I have been referred to a specialist by my GP because a cyst on my liver was found by chance (the scan i had was looking for possible gallstones). Naturally, i am terrified it's cancer and can't get it out of my mind that this is the reason i am being referred. My question is, is my referral due to the fact that the GP suspects cancer? i do appreciate any answers please"
"Cancer","Worried I have brain tumour. 20/y old female","Hi, it started a month ago with a throbbing and hard pulse in my head, then ever since a dull throbbing and ache in my head, mainly on the right side, sometimes, rarely, on the left. Its sometimes there in the morning. At worst, I cry with it. It just feels like an insane pressure and that something is literally inside my head. I had a normal MRI 6 months ago but these symptoms have only occured in the past month.Other symptoms include:Numb tingling right hand in morningWhite spots in right eye visionLine in right eye that goes further down my eye each time I blinkShooting pains in head - sometimes when I bend down.Nausea I have had a full eye test three weeks ago - everything is fine with my eyes. I have had the doctor shine a light in my eyes and he checked my reflexes - all said to be fine.Could this be a tumour? I have been reading about them and am generally worried that it could be a gioblastoma as they are a tumour that grows fast - I am worried it could have appeared since MRI.Please if anybody has any advice please let me know.Thanks.

"Cancer","Urgent referral - possible bladder cancer","Hi. I've recently started needing to pee all the time. My GP took a urine sample and prescibed a short course of antibiotics but they didn't help. Yesterday I took another sample in and the surgery phoned me and asked me to come in to see the nurse. Apparently the antibiotics were to ensure the blood found in the 1st sample wasn't due to infection and as blood was in the 2nd sample they have referred me for further investigations. I don't think I took it in properly when I was told and there are a few questions I wish I'd asked.Firstly, how are the investigations likely to be carried out? I don't really want to tell my family about this at the minute as I don't want to worry them but if I have to spend a whole day in hospital or have general anaesthetic I may have to.Also, I've been so tired lately. Is that likely to be a bad sign?"

"Cancer","My sister has terminal cancer but ive been cut off from her and her girls","Growing up my half sister and i were very close, we did everything together, i have been there for her and her 3 girls through a lot of hard times. At one point i was pretty much her free live in babysitter, while she went out enjoying the single life but i didnt mind coz i always thought we would always be there for each other when needed. Her girls always came to me with thier problems, and even when my sister moved away 12 years ago with her new fella, we stayed in touch and i promised her that i would look out for her girls and be there whenever they needed me. I kept my promise.Over the past 8 years we have drifted apart, i had my own daughter and we live so far apart we only saw each other a few times a year, i still kept my promise though, her girls all came to me (when they couldnt go to her) with thier worries and problems and i have always done what i can to help, even had one of them move in with me when she lost her home through drugs. Her eldest is my daughters godmother.6 years ago my sister (half) was diagnosed with colon cancer, and it was a difficult time for the whole family, but we pulled together, i couldnt go and see her as much as i would have liked because i had a small baby, but we talked quite often and once again i promised i would be there for her girls to talk to. Since then the cancer has spread throughout her body and so it seems has another form of cancer.Her bloke took it into his head that i was posting things about me having cancer online, which i think is just sick, the thought wouldnt even cross my mind having seen so many loved ones suffer from this horrific disease. Sadly, her mother, jumped on the bandwagon and my sister and her girls ended up believing it all, which really hurts.... a lot. That all happened christmas last year, her eldest went to my mum and dads and literally attacked my mum (my sisters step mum) then turned up at my door and knocked it down to get at me, scaring my then 4 year old to bits. I sent her packing and told her not to come back until she could see sense. I have tried talking to my sister but have been told im not wanted. I have sent letters but no replys, my nieces wont talk to me, thier grandad or my little girl. i have been verbally abused in my home town by my sisters mother and i have had really nasty messages from her other half and one of my other half sisters. I have been told our Dad isnt my real Dad which is a pure and utter lie.In november she was told the cancer had spread so far there was nothing left to do for her and on friday she was rushed into hospital with a serious infection, they dont think she will make it out of hospital again. This has all been a complete nightmare. made even worse now because they are now stopping our dad from going to see her and holding her hand, and all because of something they say I did (which i didnt). Dad is in his late 80's and frail himself, he cant drive all the way out there and needs someone with him but none of his (my) family are willing to take him.i am trying soooooo hard to be there for my Mum and dad, to keep it together and stay strong, not let my sadness affect them, or my guilt, because although i didnt cause any of this, they have used me as a reason to stop Dad from being with his daughter and i wish i could be there for my sister, my nieces and the rest of my family but i cant, and its eating me up inside. I have tried to talk to friends but they all say the same thing...... theyre not worth it.Since friday i havent slept, i broke down at my little girls school this morning (not something i make a habit of) and i feel alone right now, alone and helpless.I dont know what i expect from using this forum but i really needed to get it all off my chest and really open up. I am screaming inside and i am so frustrated, if anyone has any constructive advice please help."

I responded well to all tests apart from my eye. I went back the day after and had the same problem with my eye, my head wasn't as near as bad. It keeps getting better in fact.

"Cancer","Anxiety over cancer","This year has been rough. Went to the doctors around this time last year as my periods were getting heavier and more painful. After the usual tests came back clear I was sent for an ultrasound shortly after xmas during which they found a cyst on my kidney (nothing regarding periods). Recieved an appointment to see a urologist who then sent me for a ct scan at the end of February. Ct scan was inconclusive as do what it was but did confirm a 2cm x 1.5cm cyst. Doctor wanted a biopsy done to find out what it was as there were different treatment options. Had biopst at end of March and after chasing uo results was told that it was cancer. Went in for a partial nephrectomy on the 22nd July and recoveres well from surgery. Have never been told what stage or grade it was although my GP says it was low all the surgeon told me of the pathology report was that it was graded 0 for coming back.So that's my story on my cancer. I am now having extreme anxiety problems. I found a lump behind my ear a few weeks ago and panicked. Was given anti biotics and it went away, In the last week I have had a uti which I thought cleared up but getting symptoms again and I have also found another lump at my ear. I can't help but constantly worry and am living in fear of cancer returning or that there was spread after all.Can someone please help"

The GP reffered him for a CT scan which has picked up a solid mass on the lower pole of one of his kidneys, measuring 1.8cm. He has since has results back saying his has an enlarged prostate and enlarged lymph nodes. He has been a very heavy smoker for the majority of his life, although gave up about 4 years ago and 3 out of his siblings have had some form of cancer, as well as both of his parents (although none renal) so naturally he's thinking the worst His Consultant arranged for him to go into hospital to have a biopsy done on Wednesday, but after 20 mins they sent him back saying that the mass was too small and difficult to get to and for him to wait and come back to try again in 6 months!! Obviously he is going out of his mind with worry - I've never seen him so anxious, he can't eat or sleep at all.I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice or can relate to this at all? 6 months seems a very long time to wait if it is something nasty as obviously things will only progress and possibly spread.Thanks for reading (my very long post!

"Cancer","Lost appetite for three months","Hello everyone,I have read many posts and feel a little guilty being here.But I am lost and afraid I may have stomach cancer.Three months ago I got bad news which devastated me.Straight away I could not eat very little,Put it down to stress/anxiety.Picked up again about 6 weeks later,then another bit of bad news.Since then I have barely eaten and now force feed at least a sandwich a day.My weight has plummeted,so very skinny.I went to my doctor who felt my tummy and uknown to me the upper abdomen was tender.Given my age,weight loss and no appetite he said I needed a endoscopy,which I am having on the 22/07/14.In the meantime a blood test was done and full blood count.i rang my surgery for the results,the receptionist told all was fine except one thing,but was unable to tell me because my doctor was away.I waited all week end to talk to him,he said all was fine nothing wrong.I questioned what the receptionist said,and he said I have no idea why she said this,but I reccomend a urgent endoscopy as it is possible something nasty is growing in there.The receptionist also said not to worry its not life threatning.What I do not understand is why he needed to change my endoscopy to a urgent one.There must have been something in my blood result.I have had a slight upper abdominal discomfort for about a week prior to seeing him,put it down to being hungry.No ther symptoms except slight warmth in tummy after eating.Now I cannot eat anything at all since that news.I am so scared that it is stomach cancer.I just feel my doctor is not telling me all.I have no one to confide in,family all goneI am disabled and no friends as such,I am finding it so hard to deal with this alone.Thankfully I found here!Please forgive me if this sounds petty,I am 65 and do not know were to turn.Thank you for taking the time to read this.od bless all."

About 3 weeks ago, I was diagnosed with intestinal obstruction, and they told me it's because of volvulus, or malrotation. Now I have a colostomy, and supposedly I'll have it for three months. About a week after the surgery, they did an MRI, ""to check if everything is all right."" Then they sent me to a better equipped hospital, for ""more investigations."" That starts tomorrow. Today I sneaked a peek at my medical file, which my parents were kind of hiding from me. They seemed very secretive. Anyway, the file said, that the cause for surgery was sigmoid tumour. The MRI results said that I have multiple hepatic metastases. Something about T1 and T2 in there that I didn't understand.... So... Am I correct saying that I have cancer? Or is it something else that I don't understand? Can anyone please shed some light on what might be happening? Sorry if it's obvious and I seem a blind fool, but it's hard to accept that something like this is happening to me. But it's even harder to not know for sure. "

I went to my GP and he told me they were either due to a viral or bacterial infection and would go on their own. He told me to gargle Corsodyl. I did and they haven't changed. I have also tried gargling salt water, L-lysine but nothing has helped at all. I went back to my GP today to see a different doctor who gave me Hydrocortisone lozengers (take one four times a day for 5 days) and if they don't work she will refer me to a ENT specialist. She was pretty clueless to what they are or what they are caused by, can anyone shed any light?They cause me no discomfort at all.I suffered from very bad acid reflux for a long time and was on Omneprozol for 7ish weeks just prior to this.I came off the contraceptive pill (Yasmin) just prior to this and was on the pill for around 6-7 years.I have post nasal drip.I have been stressed for quite a while as my Gran died last Sept and have been stressed ever since.Any advise or help would be so helpful as the stress is getting me down.

"Cancer","Could it be a brain tumor?","These symptoms are of my 16-year-old daughter: About 6 weeks ago she had woken up and she would feel extremely dizzy like the whole room was spinning and she vomited (also she had ringing in her ears like she always has and her left ear was congested). Anyway, she spent the day sleeping and resting and the following day she was fine. However, 3 days ago she got home from school and said she was feeling dizzy again because of her ears (she thought it was because of her ears) yet the next day she formed a new theory that the dizziness and fullness on her head is because of her eyes (because she started getting dizzy when she read a few lines of a book). Generally her symptoms are: light dizziness, pressure on her head (a few cm above her forehead) and fullness), she feels her eyes are tired. We checked her eyes at an ophthalmologist and after a lot of test he said that her astigmatism (0,75 on each eye) is probably unrelated and generally her eyes and optic nerve and vessels are looking great. I'm worried. She can't study and she can hardly watch TV or surf the Net. Could it be a brain tumor?"
"Cancer","Bone pain/bone cancer worry...","Hi, i wonder if any one has had these symptoms who can shed some light for me.. I have had an on/off painin my right calf for 3weeks now. The pain is so deep tho it feels like a growing pain even tho im nearly 30! It comes and goes, but mainly appears when im sat down, rarely when im walking or standing. I now have a similar pain in my right forearm, it feels quite stiff at times but the discomfort doesnt impact on things like carrying bags or preparing dinner. Its literally like childhood growing pains. I started the gym a week ago and thought maybe i had strained my arm but its mainly when im relaxing that the pains arrive, not during exervise. Now im frightened tho as i cant find anything to advise me except the worst.. Docs seem relaxed as they 'cant say what it is'. Iv been back twice now. Anyone who could advise me i would be so grateful to hear from you."

"Cancer","Still Surviving","I thought you may like to hear an update regarding my husband,Neville who was originally only offered palliative care this time last year. Eleven months on from the operation to remove the bile ducts he is back to his normal weight, looks really healthy and is enjoying life. He still has to do his 5 years cancer free but things are looking good for him. He visits Birmingham every six months now for check ups, and a recent blood test showed that there are no tumour markers present.To all of you out there suffering this dreadful disease please be positive. Neville has been extremely lucky, if we hadn't pushed for an operation he would have been dead now."
"Cancer","my naughty glomus tumour","Hi every oneand esp hi to ones with similar tumour as mine. :D I just found this site few hours ago and I really love it. I've been trying to reach others like me for a really long time and now I have the chance I would like you to feed me with loads of information and suggestions.I'm 19 yrs old male and was diagnosed the tumour at the age of 17. So far I have found myself the youngest among us and thats not good as it sounds. I have very little experience with my life and don't know how to cope with this problem. I act like a normal teenager which is really hard. I drink and smoke socially, I love playing football and play often. current problems with my conditons are-my left eye that does not shut and gets watery (any solutions? plz)-my swollen left face which has changed the structure of my face, does it go back to normal?-when I smile or laugh, i can with only one side of my face and it looks really weird. current solution:cover face or stay motionlessI've had two embolisation till now but I don't think my condition is getting better. my consultant has suggested that I have this embolisation once a year. my tumour is too big to operate and is in the middle of a bunch of important nerves so the only choice I have now is to have the embolisation thingi. I would be really sad if I got worse that this. I am studying A levels and earning grades for uni. at the moment I am deaf with left ear.anyone with similar experience and suggestions please post comment. :D p:::"

"Cancer","bladder cancer","I am a 59 year-old woman who has been dealing with bladder cancer since April, 05. My bladder was removed surgically and replaced with neo-bladder in Feb.,07. I have experiences many complications requiring three additional surgeries. Now, I am told I have a bladder/bowel fistula, and will habe surgery soon to correct the problem. However, my doctor tells me I may have to have a urostomy. The most disturbing part for me is that he says he will most likely have to put the stoma above my waist. I have always thought they are placed below the waist, which I would prefer. Any experience or knowledge would be helpful. I am seeking a second opinion later this week.Thanks, lynn"

"Cancer","I've had a medium size Acustic Neoroma detected on my le...","I've had a medium size Acustic Neoroma detected on my left side. I searched really hard to find the best method of treating this condition. As I am only 42 years of age, Radiotherapy was not recommended as the long term consequences are not really known and there are few theroretical complications in the long term. I therefore opted for Surgery. In Britain, I was offered various options by different surgeons in removing this tumour. Some with good potential of hearing preservation and other with no potential of hearing preservation especially when my hearing was perfect before surgery. However, the incisions for the best approach in Britain is still very large and involves a long time for recovery. That is until I discovered a centre in Marseille in France who do this surgery with small incision technique through a 2cm window in the skull and this can be achieved with the aid of an endoscope. Although a lot of the British surgeons tried to discourage me from having it I went ahead with it. I must say I do not regret one bit about my decision. The surgery went like a dream and I was back to work 5 weaks after surgery when most units here in the UK advised a minimum of 2 months. I highly recommend this approach for any body interested and happy to supply all the information if they care to email me. Good luck to all those who are in the turmoil of deciding which technique to have![i:46b524f652]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:46b524f652]"
